    "raw_text": "A government official said the investigation uncovered that although the land on which the hoarding was erected belonged to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Khalid, who was the Government Railway Police (GRP) Commissioner at the time, allegedly instructed a law officer to alter his report to state that the land belonged to the Railways. This action is said to have caused financial losses to the state. Additionally, the Crime Branch found that the tendering process for the hoarding violated government regulations.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe report specifically references Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants. This section states that a public servant can be charged if they dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriate property entrusted to them or intentionally enrich themselves illicitly while in office.\n\nWhile the Crime Branch has not yet directly linked Khalid to a financial trail, the chargesheet notes that Arshad Khan, an accused in the case, took Rs 84 lakh from Bhavesh Bhinde, the owner of the illegal hoarding that collapsed. Khan was also a partner in a company where Khalid\u2019s wife was a partner. Khan told police that he provided services to Bhinde and was paid for them.\n\nAccording to the Crime Branch, Khan had received cheques from Bhinde, which were then deposited into various bank accounts before being converted into cash.\n\nSo far, the crime branch has officially not clarified what happened to the cash handed over to Arshad.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSources said a decision on the report sent by them would either be taken by CM Devendra Fadnavis who is also the home minister or the additional chief secretary (home). An official said that under Section 17(A), an approval from the state government would be needed to carry out a probe against a government servant under the PC Act.\n\n\u201cOnce the government approves the same, it can hand it over to the ACB which may either begin an enquiry on the facts mentioned in the report or register an offence against Khalid,\u201d the source said.\n\nSoon after the case came to light, the Maharashtra government suspended IPS officer Khalid who has not yet been reinstated. The government also formed a judicial commission to probe the rules flouted in the collapse.\n\nIncidentally, Khalid had been summoned by the ACB on Wednesday in connection with a complaint given against him by a person who claimed to have sponsored the officer\u2019s hotel stay in the US to get a hoarding contract at Dadar. The agency had begun the probe against the officer in July last year. Khalid did not appear before the agency and sought more time.",

I will take up the pollution issue with the Union environment minister,\u201d she said.\n\nSule said the administration is bothered only about giving permission to highrise buildings but has failed completely in delivering basic civic facilities to residents. \u201cI request Guardian Minister Ajit Pawar, the municipal commissioner and district collector to provide clean and safe water to citizens,\u201d she added.",

    "raw_text": "\u201cMaterials play a key role in advancements of defence technologies. The DRDO has been an early adopter of composite technology in the country. A good example is our Tejas aircraft. It has 45 per cent composites by weight in its airframe. If we look at the surface area which is visible, 90 per cent of it consists of composites. It has helped make the aircraft stealthier \u2014 even though it was not designed for stealth \u2014 as compared to contemporary fighters of the same class. We are now moving on to AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft), which is going to be a fifth-generation stealth aircraft. Here, the composites, in addition to the shaping as well as RAM and RAP (Radar Absorbent Material and Radar Absorbent Paint) which we are developing, are going to play a key role in ensuring that the stealth requirements for this fighter are met,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u201cOur missile cluster also adapted to the composite technology very early. Earlier most of our rocket motor casings were made of maraging steel. We adapted to composite moto casings and this has helped us especially in our strategic programme for achieving longer ranges. R&DE (Engineers), which is organising this conference, has been one of the key drivers of composite technology in DRDO. They have used composites for bridges, for SONAR domes for ships and submarines, which are really huge structures. There are other labs in the DRDO like the Advanced Systems Laboratory, Defence Materials and Stores Research and Development Establishment, Defence Lab Jodhpur, which are looking at different composite materials,\u201d he added.\n\nPune-based R&DE (Engineers) has worked on several strategically crucial technologies including stealth radomes for enhanced radar capabilities in fighter aircraft, sonar domes for naval ships ensuring acoustic precision and durability, composite military bridges that are lightweight, portable, and robust for deployment in combat zones and composites hull for infantry combat vehicles among others.\n\nKamat said, \u201cThe ceramic matrix composites and carbon fibre silicon carbide are going to play a key role in our hypersonic missile programme and our aero engine programmes. We are still at a nascent stage. We also have to address the issue of metal matrix composites especially for our turbine disks. If we have to reduce weight we will have to look at titanium matrix composites. Our bulletproof jackets, armour protection is again a very important area for DRDO. There we use ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or kevlar type of fibres. And we are dependent on imports for that. So there is scope for fibre development. There is a national textile mission which is trying to address this issue. I am sure that in the next four to five years we will have an indigenous fibre for this,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Prateek Kishore, Director General of the Armament and Combat Engineering Cluster of the DRDO, Dr Makarand Joshi, Director, R&DE (Engineers), Dr A Rajarajan, Director, Satish Dhawan Space Centre, and president, ISAMPE were among those present for the conference.",

I told her not to go to Mahakumbh but she (Megha Hattarwat) was adamant about visiting. We were planning her marriage and talks were going on. She convinced me by saying that it happens only once in 144 years and she did not know whether she could travel after her marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last call my daughter made to me was around 10 pm on Tuesday. She did a WhatsApp video call to show the crowd. I warned her to stay away from the crowd. Next morning, I watched the television and found out that there was a stampede. I tried to contact them but their phones were unavailable. I also reached out to the Uttar Pradesh authorities but they did not provide any information,\u201d he added.\n\nChandrakanth Patil, who also travelled with Megha Hattarwat, later informed Deepak Hattarwatt that they were searching for his wife and daughter.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u201cAround 3 pm on Wednesday, I got the confirmation that they were dead.

From here, we all took different vehicles to reach the Kumbh snan place. Some unfortunately died in the stampede.\u201d\n\nAnother deceased Mahadevi Hanumant Bavanur\u2019s son said they received a call from one of the fellow travellers around 3.30 pm on Wednesday, informing them that his mother was missing.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u201cI tried reaching out to my mother but there was no response. We were anxious\u2026 The last call she made was around midnight and that call was plagued by network issues. Around 1 pm (on Wednesday), we got confirmation that my mother was dead,\u201d he added.\n\nAmong those who died at the Kumbh Mela, the bodies of two individuals have already arrived at Belagavi airport and have been handed over to their families. The bodies of the remaining two have reached Goa airport and will be transported by road to Belagavi by midnight 12:00 AM\n\nExpressing condolences, he added, \u201cOn behalf of the government, I extend my heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved families. The government has already covered all expenses related to transporting the bodies from Delhi to Belagavi and will also consider providing appropriate relief. However, no compensation can ever replace the loss of life. The government stands in solidarity with the victims\u2019 families.\u201d\n\nThe minister also confirmed that Karnataka government officials have been sent to Delhi to provide necessary assistance to pilgrims from the state affected by the tragedy. He added that the department\u2019s helpline has been receiving calls from the kin of pilgrims, and based on these, officials have been trying to contact pilgrims who travelled to the Kumbh Mela.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe minister also announced that one individual from Karnataka who visited Mahakumbh could not be traced. \u201cMost of the Karnataka pilgrims have been traced. However, one person who travelled with the Isha Foundation group has not been responding to calls, even though his phone is ringing. Efforts are underway to locate him.\u201d\n\nAsked about the exact number of people from Karnataka present at the Kumbh Mela, the minister said, \u201cWe have not yet received any official data from the Uttar Pradesh government regarding how many people from Karnataka attended, how many were affected by the tragedy, how many were injured, or the confirmed number of deceased. To address this, IAS officer Harshal Boyle has personally travelled to the site to visit local hospitals and verify if any injured Karnataka residents are receiving treatment there.\u201d",

The notification states that the investigation report has to be submitted within one month of the commission\u2019s formation.\n\nWhile announcing the judicial probe, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, in a statement, said: \u201cThese incidents give us lessons as well. We have decided to go into the roots of this incident. We will conduct a judicial inquiry into it. Because, after so many reviews of the arrangements done and keeping vigilance at the local level such tragedy took place. The inquiry is being done to find out the reasons.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh and Director General of Police Prashant Kumar on Thursday reached Prayagraj for a detailed probe into the stampede. On Wednesday, while announcing a judicial probe into the incident, the chief minister said that UP Police would conduct a separate inquiry into the incident.\n\nAccompanied by senior district administrative officials, the chief secretary and the DGP inspected the site of the stampede in the Mela area. They later chaired a review meeting. \u201cThe accident cannot be undone, but our priority is to ensure that the Amrit Snan on Basant Panchami is executed with the best possible arrangements,\u201d the chief secretary said after the review meeting.\n\nIn the ongoing Kumbh, Makar Sankranti was the first amrit snan (earlier called shahi snan) day, and Mauni Amavasya the second. The third is Basant Panchami on February 3. Shiv Ratri, which falls on February 26, the last day of the Kumbh Mela, is also significant.\n\nEmphasizing the need to prevent excessive crowding at Sangam during the upcoming Amrit Snan, he directed that multi-level barricading should be implemented to regulate the flow of devotees and the diversion plan must be strictly enforced. He also informed officials that the chief minister has deployed additional senior officers to further enhance the arrangements.\n\nIn a bid to further strengthen the arrangements at the Maha Kumbh, the Uttar Pradesh government has deployed two former senior officers on Mela duty \u2014 Ashish Goyal, who served as divisional commissioner of Prayagraj for the 2019 Kumbh; and Bhanu Goswami, former vice chairman of the Agra Development Authority.\n\nAdditionally, five special secretary-level officers are being assigned to oversee operations. All of them will remain in Prayagraj till February 12 to assist in streamlining the arrangements.\n\nThese officers will assist in planning and executing measures to ensure maximum convenience for pilgrims, making their bathing and movement experience seamless and memorable, the chief secretary said.\n\nThe review meeting was attended by UP Power Corporation Chairman Ashish Goyal, Principal Secretary (Urban Development) Amrit Abhijat, ADG Bhanu Bhaskar, Commissioner Vijay Vishwas Pant, Police Commissioner Tarun Gaba, DIG Vaibhav Krishna, and SSP Rajesh Dwivedi.\n\nThe chief secretary and DGP also visited Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital to meet the injured devotees.",

    "raw_text": "What is the first requirement of the home care worker pilots programme?\n\nThis programme does not require a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), but it does require a job offer from a sponsor for a caregiver position.\n\nHow many PR spots are available under this programme?\n\nAccording to IRCC, around 10,920 new immigrant admission spots will be allocated for the 2025-2027 period under its Federal Economic Pilots category. The exact number of spots for the home care worker programme is not yet available, but experts predict it will be nearly double that of previous programmes. For context, earlier programmes, which were discontinued to launch this new one, offered approximately 5,500 PR spots.\n\nWho is eligible for the new Home Care Worker Immigration Pilots programme?\n\nTo be eligible, foreign nationals must have language skills equivalent to at least Level 4 on the Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) scale. The educational qualification should be equivalent to at least a Canadian high school diploma (10+2). Additionally, the aspirant must have relevant work experience in home care. \u201cIn earlier programmes, the required home care experience was six months, but this time it could be longer. This experience should be actual home care experience, not institutional care,\u201d said Canada immigration expert Gurpreet Singh from Kapurthala.\n\nWhen did IRCC announce the Home Care Worker Immigration Pilots and why?\n\nIRCC announced its intention to open these new immigration pilots for home care workers on June 3, 2024. However, detailed eligibility requirements and other specifics are still awaited. Applications will now be accepted starting March 31, 2025.\n\nThe Canadian government is under pressure due to the growing demand on its healthcare services, and this programme is intended to alleviate some of that burden by placing caregivers in homes. Canada\u2019s ageing population is increasing rapidly\u2014a significant challenge for the government.\n\nWhat should be taken into account when applying?\n\nGurpreet Singh emphasised that it is crucial to consider the income of the job provider. The provider\u2019s income should be sufficient to support their own family and pay the caregiver, who will likely come with their own family to Canada.\n\n\u201cSometimes, even if the job provider\u2019s income is high, their liabilities may be greater, preventing them from meeting all expenses, including the caregiver\u2019s salary. In such cases, there\u2019s a high chance of visa rejection. On the other hand, if the provider\u2019s income is lower but their expenses and responsibilities are minimal\u2014along with living in an area where the cost of living is lower than in big cities\u2014the application could still be successful. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to assess both the income and liabilities of the job provider,\u201d said Gurpreet Singh.\n\nHe added that IRCC has not set any specific income criteria for the job provider because there are many factors, including liabilities, family size, and the cost of living in different provinces, that influence the decision.",

Security personnel of Kapurthala House frisked the FST and officials. They then agreed for an inspection of the periphery and lawns but denied access to the rooms of the bungalow, which remained locked. 4. No search conducted, complaint remains unresolved: As the rooms were locked and access was restricted, the FST team\u2026 left the spot without conducting any search. Consequently, the cVIGIL complaint could not be resolved\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe claims that the FST thoroughly searched every \u2018nook and corner\u2019 of Kapurthala House are factually incorrect.

The Guneri inland mangrove site is the last remains of its kind in India, they said.\n\nMangroves are typically sighted at the sea coast which is sludgy and accessed by seawater at least once every day. However, the Guneri mangrove site is located at a distance of 45 km from the Arabian Sea and four km from the Kori Creek, where seawater never approaches. It is also devoid of any sludge, and is spread over a flat piece of land like a forest.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that people know about such a unique place,\u201d said the government release.\n\nLocal people including tribal people and forest officials will be provided training for the conservation of the unique site, the release added.\n\n\u201cThe Guneri inland mangroves are presumed to have originated long back. They are assumed to have originated either after the marine transgression which occurred in the area during the Miocene period or on the bank of the lost river (the Saraswati River) in the Great Rann of Kachchh. The Saraswati, a mythological river, is assumed to have once run in the Great Rann of Kachchh during 3000-4000 B.C.,\u201d a senior official of the forest department said.\n\n\u201cStudies elsewhere have reported that the inland mangroves survive in areas having limestone deposition which connects with the sea bed. The limestone provides a continuous flow of groundwater to the mangrove ecosystem/vegetation. The Western Kutch and areas surrounding the Guneri mangroves have records of limestone depositions. The Guneri inland mangroves have existed on these limestone depositions for centuries \u2014 thus making it a unique biodiversity site,\u201d the official added.\n\nThe Guneri inland mangrove area houses 20 migratory and 25 resident migratory avifaunal species.",

The state has demanded that Rs 2,000 per acre should be given by the Centre while Rs 500 per acre would be paid by the state. \u201cThe total cost of this initiative is estimated at Rs 2,000 crore, the Government of India is requested to provide Rs 1,600 crore as budgetary support, while the remaining Rs 400 crore will be borne by the state,\u201d the wishlist stated. Burning paddy stubble is a significant issue in Punjab, contributing to pollution in Delhi.\n\nAdditional borrowing\n\nThe government has also sought 0.5 per cent additional loan against power sector reforms on the basis of the 15th Finance Commission\u2019s recommendations. Cheema has given the highest priority to the power sector in the expectations that Punjab has from the Centre in the budget. He said he had also written a letter to Sitharaman n December 24 for reforms in the power sector, in which he had said that the criteria for additional loan should be changed.\n\nThe wishlist said that the state is eligible for receiving the additional borrowing of 0.5 per cent for power sector reforms for the entire four-year period i.e. financial year 2021-22 to 2024-25. \u201cBut it is brought to your kind attention that the Ministry of Finance in its letter dated 09.06.2021 has stated that States will not be able to carry forward the additional borrowing to the subsequent financial years,\u201d Cheema wrote.\n\nReimbursement of Rural Development Fund\n\nThe government has also sought reimbursement of pending Rural Development Fund (RDF), a levy on procurement of grains by the state for the Centre. The Centre has been withholding Rs 8,000 crore towards RDF that it has not paid for last three years.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe provisional cost sheet does not account for any provision of the RDF. Over the past years, Punjab has repeatedly requested the Union government to include a 3 per cent allocation for RDF in the provisional cost sheets and to release the pending amount of Rs 6,857 crore. The withholding of RDF has significantly affected Punjab\u2019s rural development infrastructure, which comprises 64,878 kilometers of rural link roads and essential market facilities,\u201d the wishlist said.\n\nGrant for police\n\nThe state has sought a grant of Rs 1,000 crore for upgrading police infrastructure in border districts, including high-end vehicles and secure police buildings; for constructing new police stations and for installation of electronic surveillance, such as CCTV cameras at border hotspots; for building 30 new police stations, six police lines, residential housing for personnel, and hostels to improve working and living conditions and enhance policing efficiency.\n\nIndustrial incentives to support MSMEs of Punjab\n\nPunjab needs to be provided with similar industrial incentives to Jammu and Kashmir and neighbouring states due to its challenges related to proximity to Pakistan and its border and sub-mountainous regions, Cheema stated. The industrialisation in six districts of Punjab, including Amritsar, Ferozepur, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Fazilka and Tarn Taran, will facilitate not only economic development but also help mitigate brain drain and churn employment opportunities for the local communities, the wishlist stated.\n\nRestoration of NABARD\u2019s ST-SAO Limit to Rs 3,041 crore\n\nNational Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has significantly reduced the limit for short-term seasonal agricultural operations (ST-SAO) from Rs 3,041 crore in FY 2023-24 to Rs1,100 crore for FY 2024-25. Cheema urged the Union government to restore the limit to Rs 3,041 crore to prevent farmers from resorting to moneylenders, in line with the principle of \u201cSahakar se Samriddhi\u201d.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nVande Bharat trains for Punjab\n\nThe state recently secured a Vande Bharat Express train connection between Delhi and Amritsar. Now, it is requesting an additional Vande Bharat train to connect Bathinda, which is the agricultural and commercial hub of Punjab, with Delhi. This new service would provide seamless connectivity for the Malwa region of Punjab.\n\nE-bus services\n\nThe government has requested a one-time financial assistance of Rs 300 crore for state transport undertakings to procure 250 new electric buses in the fiscal year 2025-26. This funding will be used for acquiring the e-buses and installing charging points, ensuring the new environmentally friendly public transportation fleet operates seamlessly.\n\nIMC in Rajpura\n\nPunjab has requested Rs 100 crore under the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan to construct a 5.6-km-long and 45-metre wide approach road connecting NH 44 to the Integrated Manufacturing Cluster (IMC) in Rajpura. This funding is essential for the timely construction of the road and the successful implementation of the industrial cluster, the wishlist stated.",

Meanwhile, in October 2022, Dhainje allegedly approached Vagyani and claimed that he had developed contacts with senior government officers. Dhainje assured Vagyani of providing a house at a low price under the MHADA lottery scheme by using his contacts.\n\nThe complainant allegedly transferred Dhainje Rs 3,000 through online mode in February 2023 for an MHADA flat. After a few days, Dhainje forwarded a forged letter to the complainant on WhatsApp claiming that MHADA homes had been sanctioned to eight people. The police said the letter carried the fake signature of an MHADA official.\n\nThe FIR mentions that along with the complainant, more persons in his contact agreed to pay money to Dhainje to get an MHADA apartment. The police claimed 75 people allegedly transferred Rs 3,000 each to the complainant, who then forwarded the amount to Dhainje. But none of them got an apartment from MHADA.\n\nHowever, Dhainje allegedly asked them to keep their documents ready for seeking possession of MHADA apartments. He also allegedly furnished some more fake documents like the \u2018MHADA offer letter\u2019 to win the trust of the victims, the FIR mentions.\n\nFurther, he asked the complainant to add all his contacts who paid money for MHADA apartments to a WhatsApp group named \u201cMHADA update group\u201d.\n\nApart from the 75 victims, Dhainje has reportedly cheated two more people of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh in a similar manner.\n\nAssistant Police Inspector Somnath Tapare, the investigation officer, said, \u201cAccused Pratik (Dhainje) was arrested and a court remanded him in police custody for further investigation. So far, we have information that he cheated several people to the tune of Rs 22.41 lakh on fake promises of giving them MHADA homes. But investigation hints at a larger scam. We suspect that he has cheated over 500 persons and there is a possibility of involvement of more persons in the fraud.\u201d",

To keep visitors engaged from the museum\u2019s ticketing and waiting lounge itself, a sensor-based floor map keeps projecting a self-guided virtual tour of this Mehsana district town, also the birthplace of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nReal excavation sites and replicas\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nOf the museum\u2019s 13,500 square metres, an area of 3,400 sq m comprises actual excavation sites: visitors can see the remains of an actual fort wall and the actual archaeological site, located next door. In the museum, visitors can walk on a glass floor installed over a replica of the site next door. This replica includes a section of the street showing how the town and its activities evolved. The museum also contains a recreated brahman sheri (a narrow lane) at Ghaskol, a small Buddhist monastery that was excavated recently. To recreate the sheri in the museum, two layers of terracotta bricks have been stacked in the manner as they were found during the excavation.\n\nFor the experiential part of the tour, a medium-sized excavation pit has been created inside the museum. Here, visitors are encouraged to use the available archaeological tools \u201cto excavate real objects\u201d, besides trying their hands on the mortar and pestle, and the miniature stone grinder.\n\nBesides replicas of marker coins recovered from the excavated site, which can be traced on paper with pencils, visitors can also use clay and moulds to make their own terracotta pots and watch them bake digitally. The museum also has activities for children. At a wall section, they can create paintings using watercolours and fill line drawings; in the shell gallery section, they can solve a jigsaw puzzle; they can also design their own bangles on a digital screen and feel them \u201cdigitally\u201d on their hand; and they can also use large replicas of beads made of stone, glass and terracotta to make their own necklaces, among other activities.\n\n\u201cIntegrated with an experiential walkway over the in situ excavation site, this is the first-of-its-kind museum in India. The thought behind it was to make someone visiting Vadnagar understand the history and importance of this town, which is over 2,500 years old,\u201d Pankaj Sharma, director, Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Gujarat, tells The Indian Express.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTo recreate the history of Vadnagar, the museum has 500 spots with audio guide sensors, eight main films, 30 sub films and various audio-visual galleries.\n\nDirector Sharma adds, \u201cUsing display and technology, the museum attempts to provide an exploration of the city\u2019s evolution through interpretations of events over time. This includes examining practices like water management, the belief in the region being a sacred space and the significant role of Nagar Brahmins, among others.\u201d\n\nGalleries and experiences\n\nWhile replicas help showcase the city\u2019s evolution, over 6,000 real artifacts have also been displayed in the museum\u2019s galleries.\n\n\u201cThe representation of cultural periods (at the museum) involves illustrating various aspects, such as urban lifestyles, beliefs, political situations, social structure and noteworthy events, as gleaned from archaeological and historical discoveries. Excavated artefacts, epigraphic evidence, existing monuments and built environments serve as narrative elements too. The city\u2019s ongoing growth and transformation are conveyed through horizontally stacked layers, with artefacts at the core of the curation process,\u201d says Grace Ann Varkey, superintending archaeologist, Gandhinagar, and the museum\u2019s curator incharge.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe museum has seven galleries and experiences based on thematic frameworks: Reception and Orientation Gallery, Introduction Gallery, City Gallery, Belief Gallery, Lifestyle and Economic Gallery, Future Gallery and Introduction to Excavation Gallery.\n\nThe Introduction Gallery starts with a 270-degree projection show. The screen then opens \u2014 like a door \u2014 taking visitors to the next level, which has been designed to help them understand artefact highlights in relation to India and Gujarat. At the City Gallery, visitors experience a chronological narrative portraying the development of Vadnagar and its evolution via artefacts, replicas, installations, artworks, water management systems, streets, walls, excavation sites, monuments and more.\n\nThe excavated site gallery is dedicated solely to the Amba Ghat excavations, where a part of the actual dig has been recreated for visitors. The Belief Systems Gallery narrates the town\u2019s religious landscape, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Islam, through related artefacts, rituals and existing religious structures. The Lifestyle and Economy Gallery depicts the town\u2019s lifestyle, economic and trade activities, and their evolution over 2,500 years. This gallery includes subsections on agriculture practices, animal husbandry, pottery and technology evolution, global trade linkages and coin, terracotta, shell, glass, stone and ivory objects.\n\n\u201cThese sections offer visitors immersive experiences, which include a variety of installations, artefacts, replicas, live workshops, 3D projections, set-ups based on AR and VR (augmented reality and virtual reality) and interactive installations,\u201d says museum curator incharge Varkey.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe Introduction to Excavation Gallery establishes the context of the excavation site by using a 3-D scaled model of the dig and installations on key findings. The gallery also introduces visitors to archaeological processes, tools and techniques.\n\nThe museum also includes three polished steel sculptures by Vibhor Sogani, an Indian artist and designer known for his large-scale public art installations. While one of these sculptures is inside the museum, two others have been installed in the gardens.\n\nTalking about the remaining galleries, Siddha Shah, superintending archaeologist, Rajkot, says, \u201cThe Future Gallery contemplates the future of Vadnagar by emphasising our traditional knowledge systems, resilient practices, and the significance of our present actions in the context of future times and generations. Marking the conclusion of the museum experience, visitors are encouraged to contribute to building a wall, both digitally and physically.\u201d",

It is only together that we can decide on a way forward,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cited C P Snow\u2019s essay The Two Cultures (1959) and said that Snow\u2019s advocacy of interdisciplinary education and dialogue is still relevant. \u201cHe advocated for a world where scientists were well versed in history and literature and the general public understood the basics of science. We believe that intellectuals who could bridge these two worlds, would be equipped to face the complexities of modern life,\u201d the Nobel Laureate said.\n\n\u201cWhat can we do today? First, instead of making people specialise too early\u2026 often we ask people at the age of 16 to choose\u2026 we need to encourage a broad curriculum that includes both sciences and humanities to create a broadly literate population,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe live in a world that often wants simple and quick solutions to complicated problems. The reality, however, is that most of the challenges we face today are highly complex with technical, social and political aspects. In an era where specialists are often the norm, we need to bring together people from diverse fields of knowledge who can understand each other and work together creatively to solve complex problems that take into account all of the various angles. Literature and other parts of humanity, like history, have a great part in helping to break down these barriers. Scientists and science writers on their part can help communicate complex ideas to the general public while also being sensitive to their social consequences. And perhaps those in the humanities can become more aware of how science works, of the uncertainties in science and what it is doing, and incorporate that into their stories and histories,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe future depends on our ability to bridge these divides,\u201d Ramakrishnan said, while claiming that the JLF is one such bridge.\n\nThe five-day event is set to feature over 600 luminaries, including Nobel laureates, Booker Prize, Pulitzer and Sahitya Akademi prize winners, policymakers, and acclaimed writers in multiple sessions, as per the organisers.",

Moreover, it referred to a Madras High Court judgment that held that a person has no right to make plaster-of-Paris idols and that the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal against the order in 2023.\n\n\u201cFor the aforementioned reasons, we are inclined to grant an interim order. It is directed that respondent corporations shall ensure that clause 2 of the revised guidelines of the CPCB, which bans the making of PoP idols as well as its immersion completely, shall be adhered to strictly in letter and spirit henceforth,\u201d it ordered. The bench will hear the plea next on March 20.",

The henna design and amulet had connections to Bangladesh, the police found, and information from locals led them to Jane-Aalam (Aalam) Shaikh, 33, who had a chicken shop in Baneli village near Titwala.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhen a police team visited the area, locals confirmed that Shaikh had been spotted with the woman, now identified as Moni Kumar, 25, and was allegedly in a relationship with her. Locals also said that Aalam had not been seen in the vicinity after he closed his chicken shop on June 22 that year.\n\nThe police then tracked Aalam\u2019s phone number, which revealed that he was in the Thane district a few days ago but had left for West Bengal. A police team then left for West Bengal, where with the help of the local police, they caught Aalam from a village in Birbhum district and arrested him on July 8, 2019.\n\nA fight over money, a relationship turns sour\n\nAccording to the police, Aalam was in a relationship with Kumar and had lent her Rs 2.5 lakh in small instalments over two years. When he demanded the money, Kumar allegedly refused to return it and threatened to inform his family about their relationship.\n\nThe police said this angered Aalam who allegedly decided to murder Kumar with the help of his cousin Maniruddin Aabu Shaikh. They allegedly went to Kumar\u2019s house in Khadavli village and strangled her using a muffler/scarf, the police said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAalam and his cousin then allegedly wrapped Kumar\u2019s body in a gunny bag they picked from the chicken shop, took it to a secluded spot, set it ablaze and then dumped it in the creek near Raya Mori bridge on June 22, 2019.\n\nBooked for murder, bail denied\n\nThe investigators found out that Aalam had thrown the SIM cards that he and Kumar used into a river under the railway bridge on the way from Shahad to Ambivali. But call data records revealed that the duo frequently communicated with each other.\n\nThe police seized a muffler/scarf from Aalam that was allegedly used to murder Kumar. The police also seized a memory card that had a picture of the accused and the deceased together. Aalam was booked under charges of murder and causing disappearance of evidence under the Indian Penal Code.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, Additional Sessions Judge S D Bhagat observed that the \u201cchain of circumstances prima facie shows culpability of the accused and establishes his complicity in the alleged offence\u201d. Noting that there was prima facie material on record to show that the accused was involved in conspiracy to commit the murder, the court rejected Aalam\u2019s bail plea citing his \u201ccomplicity\u201d in the case.",

She also has a younger brother.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nParmar says that in her village, girls don\u2019t play with others or go outside their homes to play once they attain puberty. Trapped at home, for Parmar, sports was a medium of expression, a place where she felt free and in control.\n\nFitness came naturally to her as she resided on the second floor and had to take the stairs multiple times to fill around 15 pots of water daily from a hand pump. The round trips built her muscle strength.\n\nIn 2015, when she was studying in a government college, her teacher asked her to participate in a judo competition. \u201cNo woman was participating in my weight category,\u201d she says. This led Parmar to take part in a few other such contests.\n\nNext year, she joined the National Cadet Corps (NCC). \u201cWhen you can\u2019t afford private colleges or other perks in life, you start looking at what is free and accessible. You make the most of what is available. So, I joined the NCC\u2026 I also enrolled for the basic mountain climbing course.\u201d\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nLater, she read about two men climbing Mount Everest in the newspaper. She went on to discover that no woman from MP has till now achieved this feat and decided that she would be the first.\n\nIn 2018, when Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government was in power in the state, she was granted sponsorship from the state and undertook the journey to scale Mount Everest. But as luck would have it, she fell short by 700 m.\n\n\u201cThough I could not complete the expedition, the news spread that I had climbed Mount Everest. When I returned, I informed everyone that it was an unsuccessful attempt. Following this, I received a lot of hate and trolling,\u201d says Parmar.\n\n\u201cI never told anyone that I had completed the expedition. How the news spread and how I was portrayed after that really hit me hard,\u201d she adds.\n\nSoon after, Congress returned to power in the state.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nDetermined to be the first woman from MP to climb the Mount Everest, Parmar re-started her journey. In 2019, the Congress government sponsored her expedition and on May 22, she made it to the highest mountain peak in the world.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, Parmar says. \u201cYou see bodies, your friends leave your side\u2026 lack of food, oxygen\u2026 and the will to be mentally strong, it takes a lot to reach there\u201d.\n\nShe was, however, the happiest when she returned home. \u201cMy father was tossed like a football on shoulders by relatives and villagers, even strangers. The entire village was proud of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat really made the difference was when women started saying they would also want their daughters to climb the Everest,\u201d she says, describing it as her biggest achievement.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSoon after, she was made the face of \u2018Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao campaign\u2019 in Madhya Pradesh. In 2022, she joined the Congress.\n\nFor Parmar, the difference between BJP and Congress is that the latter gives \u201cclear cut responses\u201d when compared to the other.\n\n\u201cWomen leaders in politics always impressed me\u2026 I thought it could be a bigger platform to help people,\u201d she adds.\n\nOn January 15, this year, hardly a month after her wedding, she came to Delhi and started helping Lamba in her campaign. She has been living on rent along with other party workers.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHer day usually begins around 10 am and ends at 5.30-6 pm. \u201cAlka ma\u2019am doesn\u2019t let us step out post dark keeping in mind our safety. The day goes around meeting people and telling them about the party and the candidate. I love being part of door-to-door campaigns, as they give us more time to interact with people and give a personal touch to the campaign,\u201d she added.",

Among the major issues in the area she counts are cleanliness and overflowing sewers during rain.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHowever, Kulbhushan, a resident of Vishnu Garden, says, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to decide who we will vote for this time. You never know until the final day when you have to vote.. but yes we will vote for change this time\u201d. He complains that he had applied for a ration card three years back; but to date, there has been no progress.\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has fielded Dhanwati Chandela, its current MLA, against Sirsa. In the 2020 Assembly elections, she defeated the BJP\u2019s Ramesh Khanna. The Congress has fielded Dharam Pal Chandela from the constituency.\n\nSirsa\u2019s padyatra continues with people joining him or greeting him with folded hands from the terrace of their homes. The drumbeats charge up the atmosphere. A volunteer shows the step count on his mobile phone, which has been in the 17,000-20,000 range every day with the election campaigning reaching fever pitch.\n\nAn elderly couple tells Sirsa that they want to cast their vote at the closest booth and they have shifted to a new area recently. Sirsa assures them that he will try to help.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAs the BJP leader moves ahead, he meets another senior citizen \u2014 Pritpal Singh, 78. The two share a friendly banter, which begins with Sirsa touching his feet while Singh greets him in Punjabi. Sirsa asks Singh for his blessings and says he won\u2019t budge unless he is promised his vote. Singh laughs along.\n\nThe next stop is \u2018Purvanchal Sansad\u2019 \u2014 a gathering of the community \u2014 in the Khayala area where migrant workers from various places like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have gathered. Sirsa is joined by Gorakhpur BJP MP Ravi Kishan, a well-known face among the Purvanchalis, who constitute a large chunk of Delhi\u2019s electorate.\n\nPraising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the work done by him for the citizens during the last 10 years, Kishan called him a fakir (holyman). He calls Sirsa his \u201cbrother\u201d and asks the crowd\u2014 Who wants to take a holy dip at the \u2018Maha Kumbh\u2019 in Prayagraj? Many people in the crowd raise their hands. Kishan then asks them to vote for Sirsa and he will ensure all arrangements are made.\n\nIn a veiled jibe at the AAP, Sirsa says, \u201cWhether it takes one or two trains or multiple buses, I will take all of you for the holy dip. People doing politics of alcohol and dirty water will go away and new people will come and bring clean water\u201d.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nListing the BJP\u2019s poll promises, he underlines that women will be given Rs 2,500, a cylinder at the price of Rs 500, and Rs 21,000 for pregnant women.\n\nWhile addressing the public collectively, Kishan and Sirsa both speak about the Ram Mandir, the development of the Mahakal temple, and the Kumbh Mela as things the PM had done for the people. Kishan also added that unlike people from other parties who have built a \u2018sheeshmahal\u2019 the PM has stuck to the ground and not used the money of the people for his gains.\n\nThe day for Sirsa continues with multiple meetings, padyatra, and then a dinner at a home hosted by a family in Rajouri Garden.",

The story is the present day and is about a young struggling actor who discovers that he\u2019s only six degrees separation from Mahatma Gandhi himself. His grandfather and his granduncle had worked with Gandhi and were friends with Mahadev Desai.

Then, he wove the story back and forth in time through this link through to Gandhi. If you still go to to the generation that was part of the freedom struggle, they will talk about knowing Gandhi or being in the same movement or city as him at some time. This is not an exaggeration, because there were so many people who were drawn to the freedom struggle,\u201d says Pathak.\n\nThe play, thus, draws attention to \u201cthe rank and file that one won\u2019t hear of in the history books\u201d. \u201cMahadev Desai is also rank and file and a symbol for the unknown participants of the freedom struggle that walked with Gandhi but without whom nothing would have happened,\u201d says Pathak.",

    "raw_text": "Additional Chief Secretary (Development) Anurag Verma on Tuesday held a meeting with experts from PDC and officials of the agriculture department and sought suggestions on how the Rs 7,000 per acre could be given to the farmers.\n\nSources said the discussions revolved around cultivating monsoon (Kharif) maize as an alternative to paddy. \u201cWe are now formulating a policy. We have discussed maize and cotton. We will be able to make an offer to the farmers in the coming days,\u201d said an official.\n\nMaize is being used as packaged fodder for cattle, meant to be supplied to Rajasthan and Gujarat, and also to produce bio-ethanol. Several units for preserving and packaging the fodder have been set up across the state. The government is planning to bring in private players to tie up with farmers to supply them maize for bio-ethanol plants.\n\nThe kharif season in Punjab is the period between the second half of May and mid-November.\n\nThe Centre had rolled out a plan last year under which Punjab farmers were to get the amount for planning any crop other than paddy as a part of CDP. Paddy was, however, included in the plan at the insistence of the Punjab government. But the benefit of the plan could not be given to the farmers.\n\nThe state government has a huge challenge staring itself in the face of reducing the area under paddy this Kharif season. Last year, the area was at an all-time high at 32 lakh hectares.\n\nThe area under cotton had dwindled drastically to a mere less than one lakh hectares last season, which is an all-time low recorded history in the state. Two years ago it was 1.79 lakh hectares. Cotton used to have a huge area in Punjab till 1980, and 1990s when it witnessed up to 7.58 lakh hectares area. A strategy for increasing the area under cotton cultivation was also sought.\n\nLast year the department of agriculture could not formulate a policy as the state leadership was busy with the Lok Sabha elections that was scheduled between April 19 and June 1, 2024. Paddy transplantation starts in Punjab in mid-June. Before that it takes a few weeks for the farmers to sow the seeds and prepare nurseries.\n\nSamyukta Kisan Morcha\u2019s (Political) Balbir Singh Rajewal had raised the issue of lapsing of Rs 290 crore in a recent meeting with Punjab Agriculture Minister Gurmeet Singh Khuddian asking him to explain why the grant could not be given to the farmers.\n\nAn issue of seed subsidy on wheat, costing the Centre and state Rs 20 crore (60:40 share) annually was also discussed at the meeting. The government has been paying Rs 1,000 on every quintal of seed purchased for up to 5 acres of landholdings. It was discussed that this subsidy should rather be paid on seeds of alternative crops to pull the farmers out of paddy-wheat monoculture.\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal of this subsidy is a political issue. The decision is to be taken by the political leadership. We can only suggest,\u201d said an official.\n\nThe state government is already facing an issue of lifting of paddy. During the last Kharif season, the farmers had faced problems with lifting of paddy as there was no space to store it due to lax movement of paddy out of godowns in the state. Some farmers had complained that they had to take a cut of Rs 200 on every quintal of paddy procured. \u201cThe farmers are also wary of growing paddy this season. They know there is no space. They would like to diversify. Just that we have to come out with a plan. We will have to do it aggressively this year,\u201d said an official.\n\nThe government will have to take charge fast. The farmers start harvesting wheat in the first week of April. After the procurement, the preparation for sowing of paddy nurseries begins.",

    "raw_text": "\u201cAt Prayagraj, the state administration had elaborate plans. Yet, one instance of overcrowding led to a stampede\u2026 a blot on the management. We have to learn our lessons,\u201d a senior government officer said, requesting anonymity.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nA day after at least 30 people died and 60 others were injured at the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj on Wednesday, the officer\u2019s concerns are understandable. In 2003, a similar stampede at the Nashik Kumbh Mela had led to the loss of 30 lives.\n\nThe Kumbh Mela sees millions of devotees take a holy dip in rivers for salvation and is held in rotation at Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik every three years. At Prayagraj, the spiritual event is celebrated along the Triveni Sangam at the confluence of the Ganga, Jamuna, and mythical Saraswati rivers. In Haridwar, the Kumbh Mela is held along the Ganga River; in Ujjain along the Shipra River; and in Nashik, along the Godavari.\n\nUnlike Prayagraj, however, Nashik has several limitations that throw up multiple challenges for the administration. While the Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj is held on grounds spread across 4,000 acres of land, the Nashik Kumbh is confined to just 300 acres. At Prayagraj, the Kumbh Mela takes place on the outskirts of the city but the Kumbh Mela at Nashik is held in the heart of the city where the riverbanks are narrower. Also, Nashik always hosts the event during the monsoon and the rainfall compounds the problems for the administration. Devotees who visit the Nashik Kumbh Mela also offer prayers at the nearby Shani temple, adding to the crowds.\n\nThis time around, Fadnavis has approved a Nashik makeover to ensure better roads, basic amenities, makeshift accommodations, a \u2018Sadhugram\u2019, etc. From parking facilities outside the Kumbh Mela venue to dedicated routes for devotees, several arrangements are being planned. The number of ghats along the riverbank is likely to be increased and multiple entry and exit points for devotees will be planned.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nFadnavis has also directed all departments concerned, including district and municipal corporations, to ensure greater coordination and systematically carry out planning and implementation. Senior BJP minister Girish Mahajan will be entrusted with the task of overseeing the preparations.\n\nDuring the meeting, Fadnavis also called for branding the Kumbh Mela to give Nashik a global spiritual destination status. The projects shortlisted at the meeting included a spiritual corridor between Nashik and Trimbakeshwar, the completion of the Ram Kal Path project, land acquisition for building special accommodation for seers and saints, widening of the Igatpuri-Nashik stretch of the Mumbai-Agra National Highway etc.\n\nIn 2015, Fadnavis, who was the Maharashtra chief minister then, had sanctioned Rs 2,500 crore for Nashik and Trimbakeshwar. This year, the budget is likely to increase, sources said.",

    "raw_text": "The case was registered based on the complaint of Ravi, a resident of Ram Darbar. He alleged that he paid Rs 75,000 to Rahul, who had promised him a sanitation worker job. As per the complaint, Ravi made the payment via UPI transactions on September 10, 11, and 13 after negotiations. However, despite making payments, he alleged he did not receive any job.\n\nWhile Kuldeep Kumar\u2019s phone was switched off after the filing of the FIR, Dr S S Ahluwalia, co-incharge of the AAP in Chandigarh and chairman of the Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board, said, \u201cThe complaint filed by a resident of Ram Darbar against Chandigarh Mayor Kuldeep Kumar, alleging that he took money in exchange for a job, is nothing but a bundle of lies and a stunt by the BJP to prevent him from voting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever BJP loses elections, it destroys democracy by filing such false complaints and tries to suppress the voice of honest people by putting pressure on them. AAP and its councillors will not be scared of such false complaints,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further claimed that the BJP, fearing defeat in the mayoral election, was trying to pressure honest officers of Chandigarh with baseless complaints. \u201cLast year, the BJP tried to pressurise Mayor Kuldeep Kumar and AAP leader Harjinder Bawa by filing a complaint of kidnapping of a councillor, which was later proved to be false.\u201d\n\nThe mayor of Chandigarh serves a one-year term, and this time, the position is reserved for a woman councillor. The contest is between Prem Lata of the AAP and Harpreet Babla of the BJP. Additionally, the senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor will be elected from among the councillors.\n\nOf the 36 votes, a candidate needs 19 to win. Gurbax Rawat\u2019s switch from the Congress to the BJP has altered party positions in the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation. The BJP now has 16 councillors, while the AAP and the Congress collectively hold 20 votes, including that of Chandigarh MP Manish Tewari.\n\nThe mayoral elections last year were also overshadowed by allegations of misconduct involving BJP councillors and the presiding authority, Anil Masih. Following the case\u2019s escalation to the Supreme Court, which made critical observations, the elected BJP mayor, Manoj Sonkar, resigned.

This raises a suspicion that the siblings might be students of a government school in Punjab. As per the initial DDR registered by Government Railway Police Bathinda, child Krishna had told cops that his mother\u2019s name was Poonam, uncle Shiva and younger brother Shankar. He also revealed that he studied in class-3 in a village called Jagta.\n\nASI Shavinder Kumar, who had registered the DDR, said: \u201cThe elder child had also told that his mother had abandoned him and his brother in train but he did not know the name of the district or address of their home.\n\nGoing by some clues, we contacted Purnia and Katihar police stations in Bihar but could not find any leads. We also reached out to the people in village named Jagta but they said no kids with these names were missing or enrolled in their school.\u201d\n\nWith the railway police failing to get any clues, the children as per procedure were handed to the department of social security, women and child development, but in the meantime, the Punjab school education department was also alerted as Krishna was found to be well-versed in Punjabi language. The officials then suspected that the children might be the students of a government school in Punjab and their parents apparently were migrant workers from Bihar. But none of the government schools from Bathinda district identified the siblings as their students.\n\nIn the latest effort, Punjab\u2019s department of social security has now written another letter to director general of school education (DGSE) to widen the search across government schools in all districts, beyond Bathinda. The letter undersigned by the department\u2019s deputy director states that \u201cduring further counselling, the children have further revealed that they also have a sister named Jyoti.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe child Krishna knows well how to read and write Punjabi and he has also revealed that he studies in a government school. But he cannot name his school or village. Hence, you are requested to circulate photos of both children in elementary and secondary schools across the state,\u201d states the letter.\n\nYadwinder Kaur, protection officer, Punjab, said: \u201cInitially we had limited the search to schools in Bathinda district but now it has been widened to entire Punjab. The children were not opening up during counselling initially. We are simply going by what they are telling us in bits and pieces. We alerted government schools across Punjab via education department as Krishna knows Punjabi language. We have again contacted authorities in Bihar via police. As per the Juvenile Justice Act, we have to make best efforts to ensure children reach their biological family but unfortunately, if it doesn\u2019t happen, we have to put both children in adoption list.\u201d",

I love my people and rule their hearts\u2026 I assure you we have not faced any problem while campaigning.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhat are the issues you are fighting for?\n\nI thought that since this constituency had an AAP MLA, some work would be done. But that didn\u2019t happen. Schools, hospitals, and roads were not built. Even drainage and cleanliness are big issues. No work has been done. Even AAP had to change its candidate this time (AAP had replaced sitting MLA Haji Yunus with Adil Ahmad Khan).\n\nThe biggest problem with AAP is that they are only banking on Kejriwal\u2019s name. For the last 10 years, Kejriwal has not even shown his face to us. The people won\u2019t fall for their trap this time. There is so much work to be done here.\n\nDo you find any similarity between AAP and BJP in terms of ideology and principles?\n\nThe AAP was born out of a movement. Everyone was on the streets during the Anna (Hazare) andolan because they were fed up of the corruption of the UPA government. The BJP gained the most from this movement. People like Yogender Yadav and Prashant Bhushan joined the AAP\u2026 they were hardworking and honest. However, they were thrown out because they would talk about how the AAP was becoming undemocratic. One person should have one post \u2013 this was how they thought democracy could be maintained. I agree with them. Is this happening in the AAP today? It is a party where multiple people are getting multiple posts.\n\nSecond, Delhi\u2019s Muslims thought that AAP has been able to stop BJP. This was part of the reason why AAP won so many seats in 2015 and 2020 polls. But what has happened now that he (Kejriwal) is remembering pujaris and granthis all of a sudden. What happened to Kejriwal\u2019s mohabbat and bhaichaara? The AAP has started following similar patterns like the BJP. They also follow Hindutva politics\u2026 they have started following the ideology of RSS. It is for the people to see.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhy AIMIM? Why not pick a party that has a strong base in Delhi?\n\nI had announced six months ago that I will contest from Mustafabad. All the parties knew this\u2026 they all announced their candidates just a few days ago. None of them reached out to me. AAP and Congress could have\u2026 but they were scared that BJP will make this a poll issue. These so called secular parties always use Muslims for votes but when it comes to fighting for their issues, they all back out.\n\nI am grateful to (AIMIM chief Asaduddin) Owaisi that he gave me a chance. I thank him from the heart. He is a seasoned politician\u2026 Parties that I spent time with, I shared meals with and campaigned for, abandoned me. But an unknown person showed faith in me. He hugged me and fielded me on party symbol.",

If he does not appear before this court on next date of hearing, it is deemed that he has nothing to say in the matter and further proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with law.\u201d\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nUnder the Section 223 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, an opportunity of being heard is to be given to the accused before the magistrate takes cognizance of the offence.\n\nThe court was hearing a complaint filed by Ashish Kaushik, an executive engineer of Haryana Water Services, stationed in Sonipat. The complaint has been filed under Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Section 353 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 356 (defamation) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\n\nMeanwhile, in his reply to the Election Commission (EC), Kejriwal cited Delhi Jal Board (DJB) CEO Shilpa Shinde\u2019s letter, which stated that the ammonia concentration is 7 parts per million (ppm). \u201cIndiscriminate discharge of industrial waste\u201d by Haryana government, he said, was the \u201croot cause\u201d of the contamination.\n\nHis reply came after the EC, on Tuesday, acting on complaints filed by BJP and Congress leaders, asked Kejriwal to give evidence supporting his allegation that the Haryana government was \u201cpoisoning\u201d Delhi\u2019s water supply in the run-up to the February 5 polls.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIn his reply, Kejriwal said, \u201cIt cannot be denied that safe drinking water is one of the most basic and essential requirements of any civilised society and raising an issue for the society with respect to the same \u2014 cannot be termed as committing an offence.\u201d\n\nShinde, in an earlier letter to the EC, had said that DJB water treatment plants are designed to treat ammonia up to 1 ppm and up to 2.5 ppm can be treated by dilution.\n\nKejriwal further listed the impact of ammonia on human health, neurological impairment, liver and kidney dysfunction, infant mortality risks and bacterial outbreaks in his reply. \u201cThe Delhi government has no role to play with such a high level of toxic water being made available by Haryana, which is an upper-riparian state,\u201d he said. As a remedial measure to the \u201cgrave situation\u201d, leading to a shortage of drinking water in Delhi, the chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab immediately requested for the EC intervention, he added.\n\nAmid all this, Saini took a couple of sips from the Yamuna near Dahisra village on the Delhi-Haryana border. He maintained that the Yamuna water on the border of Haryana from where it enters Delhi completely meets the standards and demanded Kejriwal\u2019s apology to the people of Delhi and Haryana for his \u201cfalse\u201d statement.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe AAP, however, called Saini\u2019s visit to the Palla ghat a PR stunt. Kejriwal alleged on X that Saini couldn\u2019t gulp the water down. \u201cHaryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini pretended to drink Yamuna\u2019s water\u2026 and then spat the same water back into the Yamuna. When I pointed out that due to ammonia contamination, Yamuna\u2019s water could be a threat to the lives of Delhi residents, they threatened to file an FIR against me. The same toxic water they refuse to drink is being supplied to Delhi\u2019s citizens \u2013 I will not let this happen,\u201d he posted.\n\nEarlier in the day, before visiting the river bank, Saini hit out at Delhi Chief Minister Atishi, whom he called a \u201cdummy\u201d CM and invited her to to Pall Ghat where he took the sip of water. \u201cThere is no poison in the water coming to Delhi from Haryana, but your minds are definitely filled with poison\u2026,\u201d Saini said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\nHe was responding to an earlier post on X by Atishi who had requested Saini that \u201cyou and I go together\u201d to the Palla Ghat \u201cand take media colleagues along\u201d as well. \u201cWe will measure the amount of ammonia in front of everyone. Everyone should know that Haryana is sending poisonous water to the people of Delhi,\u201d she had written.",

Earlier this week, Rajya Sabha MP and former team India cricketer Harbhajan Singh also held roadshows in the city. A prominent face missing from the citywide campaign is Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s wife Sunita. She had campaigned for the AAP and Congress candidates ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Sources said she is only campaigning in Kejriwal\u2019s New Delhi constituency.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe BJP\u2019s juggernaut includes leaders such as Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and his counterparts from Haryana, Nayab Singh Saini, Uttarakhand\u2019s Pushkar Dhami, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Assam CM Himata Biswa Sarma.\n\nOver the coming week, party insiders said, the BJP will step up its pitch of \u201cmaking existing welfare schemes more efficient\u201d and seeking to bolster trust in its own welfare schemes \u2013 especially the promise of disbursing Rs. 2,500 per month to women from economically-challenged households. This is expected to happen in unauthorised colonies and slums. On Wednesday, the party held 35 assembly-level meetings across the city.\n\n\u201cDuring public meetings held in the city by national leaders, especially CMs from BJP-ruled states where schemes similar to the ones the BJP has announced in Delhi are in place, the emphasis has been on building confidence among voters from those states residing in Delhi as well as the area per se that if the BJP can deliver on these promises there, it will do so in the Capital as well,\u201d a senior leader said.\n\nThe Congress, too, has enlisted its elected leaders and state unit members from various regions to spearhead its campaign and showcase governance models implemented by Congress-led governments elsewhere. Among those taking centerstage is Rajasthan MLA and former Union Minister Sachin Pilot, who has been actively involved in the Delhi campaign. On Tuesday, Pilot joined Delhi Congress Chief Devender Yadav\u2019s \u2018Padyatra\u2019 in Badli.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe party\u2019s first guarantee, the \u2018Pyaari Didi Yojana,\u2019 which assures women a monthly stipend of Rs. 2,500, was introduced by Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar. The second poll promise, \u2018Jeevan Raksha Yojana,\u2019 which offers free healthcare coverage of up to Rs 25 lakh for all Delhi residents, was introduced by former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. He pointed out that the initiative is modeled after a healthcare scheme implemented by the Congress government in Rajasthan in 2011.",

    "raw_text": "Negi (45), currently an MCD councillor from Vinod Nagar, which comes under the Patparganj Assembly constituency, had been in the news in the recent past.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nRecently, a series of videos that Negi had been circulating on his own social media handles had led to a controversy. In one such video, he is seen interacting with Altamash Tomar, who runs Tomar Dairy store at West Vinod Nagar.\n\nNegi is seen telling Tomar: \u201cThis (signboard) has just Tomar written on it. Whatever your real name is, the Muslim name, get that written on the board. Get it done by tomorrow.\u201d He then threatens to seal the shop if the changes aren\u2019t made.\n\nIn many such videos that Negi used to previously upload on his social media, he is seen telling Hindu street vendors to put up saffron flags on vending carts. He is also seen visiting butcher shops before festivals, demanding that they be closed to respect the religious sentiments of Hindus.\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, Negi says, \u201cDuring Navratri, many shops are run under misleading names. The local RWA (residents welfare association) approached me with complaints. I conducted an awareness drive, telling shopowners to clearly display their proprietorship. There is no issue with this.\u201d\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nLallan Prasad, who sells tea outside Negi\u2019s core area in East Vinod Nagar, says, \u201cI have heard that he troubles street vendors, but haven\u2019t experienced it personally. He rarely visits this area.\u201d\n\nAlthough, most shopkeepers in Negi\u2019s jurisdiction refrained from commenting on the videos, Mohammad Raja, a grocery store owner near Negi\u2019s residence, says: \u201cHe does interfere sometimes, but it\u2019s not excessive. He gets involved if he finds shops with unchanged boards\u2026 people who rent shops and don\u2019t change the (signboard) after renting it have faced issues.\u201d\n\nNegi\u2019s political journey began in 2020, when he made an impressive debut by giving then deputy Chief Minister and AAP Patparganj candidate Manish Sisodia a tough fight, losing by a margin of just 2%. In the 2022 MCD polls, he defeated the AAP candidate by 2,311 votes.\n\nDue to his grassroots approach, Negi\u2019s rise within the BJP has been rapid. Previously serving as Zila Mahamantri of the Delhi unit, he gained prominence after 2020 polls. A party insider says, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t well-known earlier, but has had a quick ascent\u2026 In 2020, (after giving Sisodia a tough fight) he suddenly appeared to become active and important\u2026\u201d\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAnother party source attributed Negi\u2019s rise to his strong connections within the BJP leadership and his grassroots influence.\n\nIn Vinod Nagar, Negi is a household name, with residents familiar with his home, old office, and election offices. However, his recognition in high-rise residential societies is limited.\n\nTo bridge this gap, his campaign team has been visiting societies to arrange direct engagements. At these gatherings, he introduces himself with, \u201cI am Ravi Negi, a soldier of Modiji and the BJP candidate. Please vote for us if you want the Eighth Pay Commission and to benefit from Union government schemes.\u201d\n\nCampaigning in high-rises, Negi acknowledges his past electoral shortcomings. \u201cIt\u2019s just the votes from societies that I was unable to gather.\u201d\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nNegi identifies water quality and drainage as Patparganj\u2019s most pressing issues. He faces competition from AAP\u2019s Awadh Ojha, a civil services coach who has replaced Sisodia, and Congress\u2019s Anil Kumar Chaudhary.",

The Indian Express spent a day with four such candidates on the margins \u2014 three first-timers at this level and a veteran \u2014 all trying their luck from four of the capital\u2019s most high-profile constituencies. There was confidence, hope, some anger and a lot of grand promises.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u2018My people trust me\u2019: Haider Ali (50), Independent\n\nWork: Driver. Constituency: New Delhi.\n\nAAP chief Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s seat. Other key candidates: Parvesh Verma, MP and son of ex-CM Sahib Singh Verma (BJP); Sandeep Dikshit, son of ex-CM Sheila Dikshit (Cong).\n\nSeated on a plastic chair outside his home in \u201cQawwal Mohalla\u201d off Panchkuian Road, Ali is \u201cunhappy\u201d with Arvind Kejriwal. \u201cWe have seen the AAP\u2019s work for over 10 years. Nothing has changed\u2026 It feels like we are living on the border of the city,\u201d Ali said. Records show the area falls under New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), which is controlled by the Centre.\n\nAli, who has studied up to Class 9, admits he is not into politics. In fact, he says, his friends and family chipped in to buy two pairs of kurta-pyjamas so that he could \u201clook like a politician\u201d. \u201cThey also collected money to file the nomination papers. One friend gave me Rs 4,000 to get pamphlets published, another gave me a car for canvassing,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nEach pamphlet has his photo, and two promises: Rs 5,000 per month for each woman and a gas cylinder for Rs 500. \u201cThe schemes of the Centre are not reaching our locality. This bias was what made me contest. My family and neighbours, who have seen me running around for their work for years, said they would rather vote for me than trust anyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about the street\u2019s name and his poll symbol, a harmonium, Ali says he hails from a \u201ccommunity of qawwals\u201d. \u201cOur roots are in Muzaffarnagar (UP). It was after settling here that the community took up other jobs like driving and tailoring,\u201d he said. Ali himself works as a driver, staying in a 35 sq-yard space in a four-storey building with his wife and two sons aged three and five. So how does he manage his campaign? \u201cThe techniques of campaigning and giving speeches, talking to voters, I am learning from Google and YouTube videos.\u201d\n\n\u2018Family, friends are helping'\u201d: Prakash Chandra Joshi (50), BRJ\n\nWork: Pujari (priest). Constituency\n\nPatparganj. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia\u2019s former seat. Key candidates: Awadh Ojha (AAP), Ravindra Singh Negi (BJP), Chaudhary Anil Kumar (Congress)\n\nHailing from Uttarakhand\u2019s Almora, Joshi says he was denied a ticket by the BJP although he is a \u201ccommitted RSS member\u201d. \u201cThat is when I came in contact with BRJ,\u201d he says about the Kanpur-based Bharatiya Rashtriya Jansatta, which is making its first poll foray in the capital.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nJoshi has set up a poll office inside a shop located on the same lane where the AAP, Congress and BJP candidates have their local HQs in West Vinod Nagar. And his feeling of disappointment at being rebuffed by the BJP is evident. Seated on a mat inside his office, he breaks down as he recalls his early life. \u201cMy father was also a pujari (priest). He died in 1990, when I was a teenager. After that, the responsibility of my mother and siblings came to me. My mother worked as a domestic help. I sold milk and distributed newspapers, so that I could study,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEven now, l don\u2019t have the money needed to contest. My wife, son, daughter and daughter-in-law are all helping me in this contest, and friends and neighbours. This party (BRJ) has given me this space, and some friends have helped me with two e-rickshaws with loudspeakers,\u201d he said.\n\nJoshi\u2019s poll promise? \u201cFree gas cylinders, revamped roads and sewage lines, a community centre, proper parking spaces, and measures to prevent chain-snatching incidents in my locality.\u201d\n\n\u2018AAP didn\u2019t listen to me\u2019: Haji Iqbal Siddiqui (49), Independent\n\nWork: Vehicle owner. Constituency\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nKalkaji. Delhi CM and AAP leader Atishi\u2019s seat. Other key candidates: Ramesh Bidhuri, ex-MP (BJP), Alka Lamba (Cong)\n\nSiddiqui, a resident of Govindpuri\u2019s Bhoomiheen Camp, owns a Grameen Sewa vehicle that ferries commuters between Tara Apartments and the Badarpur border. With a cooler as the election symbol, this is his first foray into the Assembly-level after having failed in two successive civic elections. He says he was an \u201cAAP karyakarta\u201d but has moved on and wants to be a part of the next government.\n\n\u201cLook at the condition of the roads, nalas\u2026 and the stalled pension for senior citizens. I will work alongside any party that has a plan to deliver basic services. When I was an AAP karyakarta, I had asked them to develop our area but they did not listen,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Siddiqui, promises of monthly cash doles by the main candidates are \u201cwrong\u201d. He has a solution, too: A monthly deposit of Rs 2,500 into the account of every one-year-old child until they turn five . \u201cIf the money is put in a fixed deposit, they will have the means to study, start a business or build a home when they grow up,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSiddiqui stays in a rented accommodation for Rs 6,000 a month and has a six-month-old daughter. He has taken a gold loan and hired two e-rickshaws for campaigning. \u201cI am going door to door and telling people to give me a chance,\u201d he said. Asked about the heavyweights in the fray, he said, \u201cYou cannot think like this when entering the battlefield, this way even Kejriwal would not have contested against Sheila Dikshit\u2026It does not take time for people\u2019s minds to change.\u201d But what are his chances, really? \u201cThere are 30-35,000 votes in my JJ cluster. I am not sure about everyone\u2019s support, but I will at least have my own vote.\u201d\n\n\u2018We need change\u2019: Yogesh Swamy (40), RWPI\n\nWork: Tuition teacher, freelance journalist. Constituency\n\nKarawal Nagar, one of the sites of the 2020 riots. Key candidates: Kapil Mishra (BJP), Manoj Tyagi (AAP) & Dr P K Mishra (Congress).\n\nThis is Swamy\u2019s second election as a candidate at the Assembly-level and sixth consecutive attempt to get elected into office \u2014 any political office \u2014 in the hope of putting in place \u201ca law guaranteeing jobs for the youth and less taxes to ensure that households have more disposable income\u201d. \u201cI have been contesting elections since the MCD polls in 2017 on this party\u2019s ticket; the last election I fought was for the Lok Sabha last year,\u201d he says.\n\nA freelance journalist who doubles up as a tuition teacher, Swamy was born and brought up in Karawal Nagar, which witnessed violence during the 2020 riots. \u201cI grew up in this area and we have seen all parties, Congress, BJP, AAP, but look at the condition of our roads, the dirty water we get from our taps. All these parties are by and for corporates, not even one of them stands for the rights of the workers,\u201d Swamy says.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhile the BJP, he alleged, was seeking votes in the name of religion, all three principal political parties were offering \u201calms\u201d for votes. \u201cWe need change,\u201d he says. And his main poll promise? \u201cWe will give an account of each rupee from public funds being spent.\u201d",

He asked his partner, who answered the phone, to come with Imtiaz. As the couple reached and settled for a conversation in a single-room house on the ground floor, Gaur, who was drinking, asked Imtiaz to bring salt for the fish that he was eating. It was a trick to send Imtiaz away,\u201d said the DCP.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAccording to the police, as Imtiaz left, Gaur forced himself on the woman and when she protested, the doctor allegedly pressed her mouth. \u201cWhen Imtiaz returned to the room, he tried to intervene and a fight ensued between the two. Imtiaz asked his female friend to leave. Gaur had a hammer, sharp blades, and other medical equipment in the room.

This is where I raised my family.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was the reason why AAP was able to open its account in Mustafabad\u2026 but when there was a crisis, they abandoned me\u2026 But the AIMIM showed faith in me,\u201d he adds. Hussain, who was expelled by AAP for his alleged role in the riots, had claimed that he was a victim of conspiracy.\n\n\u201cI have a dream to improve roads, set up schools and hospitals for the people of Mustafabad,\u201d he says, eliciting a loud cheer from the gathering.\n\nAs Hussain and his workers traverse around the streets of Old Mustafabad, what catches the eye are roads full of garbage and choked drains. Across every street, about 15 feet from the ground, is a criss cross of cables and party banners.\n\nAs part of his roadshow, three autorickshaws with AIMIM flags and posters follow Hussain, who is showered with flower petals from houses. A man holds a portable speaker to announce \u2013 \u201cdekho dekho kaun aaya, sher aaya, sher aaya\u201d.\n\n\u201cAsalam walekum, mere sabhi bhaiyon ko,\u201d says an AIMIM worker as he shakes hands with everyone. His refrain \u2013 \u201cPatang ka button dabaye (click on the kite button, the symbol of AIMIM)\u201d.\n\nHussain\u2019s supporters storm the room in which he is about to give a speech, as police personnel try to control the crowd with the help of AIMIM workers. Wiping his face of sweat, Hussain asks his supporters to relax and make way for AIMIM leader Imtiaz Jaleel. As Jaleel enters the room, the crowd cheers loudly.\n\nAfter the gathering, as police personnel ask the crowd to disperse, AIMIM workers tell the gathering that the roadshow will resume on Thursday.\n\nThroughout the day, not a word is spoken about the 2020 riots case for which he Hussain was in jail. On Tuesday, while allowing him custody parole from January 29 to February 3 to campaign, the Supreme Court had barred him from making any public comments on the merits of his case.",

He added, \u201cIf someone is alone, self-assessment can be done in front of a mirror. Closing one\u2019s eyes while performing the namaste can also help detect sensory or balance abnormalities, which may indicate posterior circulation strokes.\u201d\n\nBreaking it down further, Dr Varadharajan explained, \u201cThe namaste posture involves flexion with abduction at the shoulder, flexion at the elbows, and wrist extension with palms pressed together. This position can reveal arm drift and grip weakness. Smiling and saying \u2018namaste\u2019 aloud helps detect facial asymmetry and slurred speech. The simplicity of this technique makes it adaptable, with regional greetings like \u2018Vanakkam\u2019 in Tamil serving as effective alternatives.\u201d\n\nThe hospital envisions this technique as a simple, accessible prehospital screening method to promote early stroke detection. Dr Varadharajan stressed the importance of public awareness campaigns to educate people on stroke symptoms, emphasising that timely detection and intervention within the narrow treatment window can be lifesaving. \u201cStroke is a growing national epidemic,\u201d Dr Varadharajan said. \u201cThe first step to combating it is raising awareness and empowering people with tools like this to act swiftly.\u201d",

In a bid to recover the loan amount from the factory, Gujarat State Cooperative Bank was about to sell it to private players. Sugar co-operative mills like Mahuva, Madhi, Chalthan Bardoli and Kamrej in Surat, had in a collective effort, managed funds and paid Rs 27 crore to the banks against the loan given to the Coper mill around 14 years ago. A board of members comprising the chairmen and vice chairmen of all five sugar cooperatives was formed to run the Coper mill. Sources said that around 3 lakh tonnes of sugarcane is crushed a year and the annual turnover is over Rs 200 crore.\n\nChairman of Sumul Dairy and Mahuva mill, Mansingh Patel, said, \u201cI was the chairman of Gujarat State Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories when the Coper mill was shut down and private players were lobbying to get the mill, but we saved it from going into the hands of private players, for the betterment of farmers. The money invested by five sugar co-operatives at that time was Rs 5 crore (Chalthan Sugar), Rs 5 crore (Bardoli), Rs 4 crore (Madhi ), Rs 2.5 crore (Kamrej), and Rs 2.5 crore (Mahuva), and the remaining money was arranged from other sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have saved the Coper mill and now it is running well. The four sugar co-operatives were worried about their invested money, so we planned to pay the invested money with interest to all four sugar cooperatives and take charge of Coper. First we will carry out meetings with the chairman and vice chairman of each of the four sugar co-operatives and convince them to take their part. For finance, we have planned to contact the National Cooperative Development Corporation of New Delhi, to get a loan at low interest rates,\u201d he added.",

The research was conducted in collaboration with scientists from Leiden University (Netherlands), University of Milan-Bicocca (Italy), and the University of Michigan (USA).\n\nGalaxies are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. Modern galaxy evolution theories predict that galaxies are interconnected by vast, invisible streams of gas and dark matter, collectively referred to as the cosmic web. These cosmic web filaments serve as the nurseries where galaxies grow by accreting pristine gas that fuels their star formation. However, observing these filaments has been a daunting challenge because of their tenuous nature with densities 100 billion trillion times lower than our atmosphere.\n\nTo detect this elusive structure, the researchers directed their telescope toward the high-redshift quasar Q1317\u20130507. By analyzing the high-resolution spectra of the quasar, they identified a neutral hydrogen-rich region, known as a partial Lyman Limit System (pLLS), at a redshift of z ~ 3.6.\n\nThis region exhibited an exceptionally low proportion of heavy elements, with a metallicity 10,000 times lower than the solar neighborhood, aligning with theoretical predictions for pristine cosmic filaments. In complementary observations with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the VLT, the team identified seven Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies at the same redshift.\n\n\u201cThe number of galaxies detected in such a small volume of the universe is ten times higher than what we typically observe in surveys at this epoch,\u201d said Eshita Banerjee.\u201c Moreover, their spatial distribution across the sky revealed a rare alignment, which strongly suggests the presence of a larger, underlying filamentary structure. The 10-hour-long deep observations with MUSE, one of the most sought-after instruments for astronomers, enabled us to search for and detect extended Lyman-alpha emission along the filamentary structure,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThese nebulae are typically observed around luminous quasars, whose intense radiation illuminates the surrounding gas. However, none of the galaxies detected in this study exhibit quasar-like properties, making this discovery truly exceptional,\u201d stated Dr Muzahid, an associate professor at IUCAA. \u201cWhile the precise mechanism(s) driving the extended Lyman-alpha emission remains unclear, we propose that recombination radiation, powered by the radiation fields of the detected galaxies, is the primary contributor,\u201d he added.",

    "raw_text": "Born in 1724 and author of the famous philosophical treatise Critique of Pure Reason, Kant is one of the most influential philosophers in Western philosophy. \u201cKant really brought a revolution in the domain of philosophy. He helped shift the focus from metaphysics to science. He also influenced many Indian minds such as K.C. Bhattacharya and Lokmanya Tilak. Tilak wrote Gita Rahasya starting with the question \u2018Is there moral theory in Indian philosophy?\u2019. He tried to compare Kant\u2019s deontological theory with Bhagavad Gita\u2019s philosophy,\u201d said professor Harish Navale, HOD of the philosophy department, SPPU.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, professor Jung said, \u201cHe revolutionised the manner in which we think about the world and ourselves. If we look at the history of Western philosophy, we measure whether something is pre-Kant or post-Kant. That is his impact. He theoretically showed, not just said, that no matter how bad we find our current situation, human beings are peculiar because we can always hope for better. In a world which is dark and pessimistic, Kant gives you strength to believe that things can be better.\u201d\n\nWhy must one not lie?\n\nDissecting Kant\u2019s complex ethical philosophy, professor Kumar told The Indian Express, \u201cThe question of ethics is how do we distinguish between right and wrong. Kant argues that the way to distinguish between right and wrong is rationally, through your reason. In your reason, if you really go deep, there is already a moral principle \u2013 act in a way that your action can be turned into a universal law. This is called Kant\u2019s categorical imperative.\u201d\n\nA lie, professor Kumar explained, is contradictory by itself. For a lie to be effective, the liar must assume that no one ever lies. \u201cOtherwise, why would the listener believe what the liar is saying? But at the same time, you should also sort of accept that the liar should be an exception to that particular rule. So, he is positing the rule and then making himself the exception. This is contradictory. Because it\u2019s contradictory, it must also be immoral.\u201d\n\nBut what if a killer who wants to murder your friend comes to your house and asks if the friend is inside? Do you tell the killer the truth and then risk potentially having your friend killed, or do you tell him a lie? \u201cKant, of course, infamously says that you should not lie. You should tell the truth. Today, I reconstructed his response. At each level, Kant gives you arguments that are rationally defensible and good premises for the conclusion that you should not lie in this particular situation,\u201d said professor Kumar.",

    "raw_text": "The incident had taken place around 6.15 pm on January 7 in the parking lot of a multinational BPO, WNS Global Services, located in Yerawada. The victim, Shubhada Shankar Kodare (28), who had sustained an injury on her hand, succumbed due to excessive bleeding. The accused, Krishna Satyanarayan Kanoja (30), a resident of Shivajinagar, was arrested. Investigation has revealed that the two were having a dispute over money Kodare had borrowed from Kanoja, which he was asking her to return.\n\nSpeaking about the security scenario at private firms, Kumar said, \u201cI want to refer to the incident in one of the companies on January 7. A young girl was assaulted and she succumbed to her injuries. The incident is very sensitive and we have been taking it with utmost seriousness to ensure that the culprit is severely punished. From the police\u2019s point of view, we often say that some incidents are preventable and some others are not preventable, theoretically. The girl had a dispute with a coworker, which ended in a physical assault on her leading to her death. We are very sorry for the family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has come to notice that the accused was carrying a kitchen knife in his laptop bag for three days before the incident actually took place. So the point arises that we have to ensure that the access control mechanism\u2026 companies do not just check whether the person is authorised to enter or not. But there will also have to be a mechanism to check whether those authorised to enter are carrying anything unwanted or unauthorised in the bag or on the person. So an effective use of DFMDs and HHMDs (Door Frame Metal Detectors and Hand Held Metal Detectors) or sample checks of bags would go a long way in ensuring that unwanted things do not reach the company and office premises and incidents like these can be prevented,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn light of the event, though we were not able to prevent that incident due to the reason I enumerated, we have to ensure that such incidents do not happen again at any cost. When I say we, I mean we as the police and you as citizens,\u201d Kumar said.\n\nThe investigation found that Kodare had borrowed money from Kanoja from time to time over the last two years. He had lent her close to Rs 4.5 lakh in total. She had borrowed the money citing reasons like treatment of her father and for her own treatment because she had diabetes. In June last year, Kanoja had an eye surgery for which he required money. He was asking for the money he lent to Kodare but she kept promising that she would repay it soon. According to the probe, Kanoja wanted to threaten Kodare to get his money back with the kitchen knife. Moments after Kanoja attacked her, she called her father telling what had happened. The accused too spoke to her father and reiterated his demand for repayment of the money he had lent her, the probe has revealed. Kodare succumbed to her injuries later.\n\nMeanwhile, a fact finding committee has been formed by the National Commission for Women (NCW) to investigate the matter. The committee recently visited the location of the crime, met the family members and colleagues of the victim and also met senior functionaries, including the police commissioner, PMC commissioner and district collector.",

The six accused are among the 15 employees who had permission to use funds from the bank\u2019s accounts for official work purposes.\n\nAccording to the FIR, the Central Fraud Monitoring Unit of the complainant bank detected certain suspicious transactions done by the six accused between April 3, 2023 and November 4, 2024.\n\nFollowing this, the monitoring team initiated an inquiry and found out that executive Siddhesh Fatnaik who works in the UPI dispute department, had transferred funds without permission and for this he used his colleague Vicky Shinde\u2019s log-in id and password.\n\n\u201cFatnaik transferred money into the accounts of Ajay Yadav, Rishabh Yadav and Sham Sunder Chauhan and received the money in cash form from them,\u201d the complainant alleged in the FIR.\n\nThe accused Sagar Mishra discovered financial irregularities being carried out by Fatnaik, and to keep it a secret he allegedly took Rs 29.35 lakh from him through the bank accounts of his family members, friends and relatives, the police complaint stated.\n\nAfter an internal internal probe, the bank filed a police complaint along with the bank statement of the accused employees.\n\n\u201cThe six accused employees were all placed under suspension by the bank. No arrest has been made yet and we are investigating the case further,\u201d a police officer from the MIDC police station said.\n\nThe police have booked the six accused under sections 318(4) (cheating), 316(2) (criminal breach of trust), 316(5) (criminal breach of trust by a broker or agent) and 3(5) (common intention) of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).",

So, do we go and look for another suspect, knowing this person committed the crime?\u201d\n\nPolice officials who were part of the investigation team were also shocked by the verdict pronounced by the Supreme Court. \u201cThe trial court heard the matter and awarded a death penalty to Sanap. The Bombay High Court upheld the decision, but the Supreme Court has allowed him to walk free due to a lack of evidence. A special investigation team was formed then to trace the culprit, and the verdict has shocked everyone,\u201d said a retired officer, part of the investigation team.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAnother officer added, \u201cI have read the judgment, which runs over 100 pages, and it shows how things can go wrong when multiple agencies are investigating the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike in this case, we were conducting a parallel investigation, while the Kanjurmarg police, under whose jurisdiction the woman\u2019s body was found, were the primary investigating agency. They retrieved the initial CCTV footage in which the techie was seen walking with Sanap at LTT railway station, but they did not follow due procedure when including the footage as part of the evidence. This is one of the grounds on which the Supreme Court acquitted Sanap,\u201d the officer added.\n\nThe 23-year-old techie from Hyderabad went missing on January 5 after arriving in Mumbai from her hometown, where she had gone to celebrate Christmas with her family. On January 16, her remains were recovered from the bushes near Tata Nagar Colony on the Eastern Express Highway in Bhandup (East). The SIT located Sanap, who the police claimed was responsible for her death, and arrested him in Nashik after CCTV footage revealed that the techie was last seen walking with him at the station.\n\n\u201cEvery time I pass through the area on the Eastern Express Highway (the spot where her body was found), the woman\u2019s photo comes to mind. Since the verdict was passed on Tuesday, I have started to feel that justice has not been served for her,\u201d an investigating officer said.",

The process breaks down waste plastics into liquified hydrocarbon oils, which are further purified to remove contaminants. The resulting chemical feedstocks can be used by petrochemical and hydrocarbon industries to produce new low-carbon materials, including circular polymers.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u201cIndia generates over 10.2 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, with over 40 per cent being single-use plastics such as grocery bags and flexible packaging,\u201d said Amit Tandon, founder and CEO of PolyCycl in Bengaluru. \u201cTraditional recycling methods struggle to process this waste, leading to environmental hazards. Our technology breaks plastics down to their molecular building blocks, which can then be reconstituted to create high-quality, virgin-like materials. With conversion yields of 65-75 per cent, our technology has already been validated by multiple global petrochemical companies,\u201d he added.\n\nScalability and cost-effectiveness\n\nA key feature of the technology is its highly scalable and cost-effective design. With modular processing lines capable of handling 15 to 100 tonnes per day of plastic waste, it offers capital costs significantly lower than similar technologies in Europe and the US\u2014between one-half to one-fourth of competitive solutions. Additionally, it delivers an EBITDA (operating profit) exceeding 50 per cent, making it commercially attractive, the company said in a press statement.\n\nSupporting India\u2019s EPR targets\n\nIndia\u2019s extended producer responsibility (EPR) regulations mandate that by 2025-26, 10 per cent of flexible packaging and 30 per cent of rigid plastic packaging must contain recycled content. \u201cPolyCycl\u2019s Generation VI technology supports these targets by producing virgin-quality recycled polymers that meet the stringent standards required for food-contact and pharmaceutical packaging,\u201d said Tandon.\n\n\u201cThe plastic waste problem is complex and requires multiple solutions\u2014from better recyclability in packaging design to stronger EPR mechanisms and advanced recycling technologies. Chemical recycling is a critical part of this puzzle, and we hope our work accelerates the adoption of circular economy practices across industries,\u201d he added.",

    "raw_text": "In the caption of the video posted on Instagram, she wrote, \u201cOne major cause is gastroenteritis due to a bacteria Campylobacter jejuni. Although there are many other causes, this is the one that you all should be aware of because this is one cause that we can avoid.\u201d\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nDr Sehrawat also stressed, \u201cAvoid eating out, especially paneer, cheese and rice as they are more prone to having bacterial growth if not taken care of properly.\u201d\n\nSo, how can contaminated food and water contribute to the development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome?\n\nDr Pranav Honnavara Srinivasan, consultant surgical gastroenterologist at Fortis Hospitals, tells indianexpress.com, \u201cContaminated food and water can be a major trigger for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) because they can harbour harmful bacteria, particularly Campylobacter jejuni, which is strongly linked to the condition. When a person consumes contaminated food or drinks unclean water, they may develop a gastrointestinal infection, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramps. While most people recover from such infections without complications, in some cases, the immune system reacts abnormally.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cThe bacteria contain molecules that mimic certain components of nerve cells, which can confuse the body\u2019s defense mechanisms. As the immune system fights off the infection, it may mistakenly attack the nervous system, leading to inflammation and damage to the peripheral nerves. This can result in muscle weakness, numbness, and in severe cases, paralysis \u2014 hallmarks of GBS.\u201d\n\nMost effective ways to prevent bacterial contamination in foods like paneer, cheese, and rice\n\nPreventing bacterial contamination in foods like paneer, cheese, and rice requires strict hygiene measures, stresses Dr Srinivasan. \u201cDairy-based products such as paneer and cheese are particularly prone to contamination if made from unpasteurised milk or stored improperly. It is important to ensure that these products come from reliable sources that follow proper hygiene protocols. Refrigeration is crucial, as bacteria multiply rapidly at room temperature. Consuming fresh paneer and cheese and avoiding those sold in open markets where hygiene cannot be guaranteed can help reduce the risk of infection,\u201d he states.\n\nRice is another high-risk food if not stored properly. Dr Srinivasan explains that when cooked rice is left at room temperature for too long, it becomes a breeding ground for Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. \u201cIt is advisable to refrigerate leftover rice promptly and reheat it thoroughly before consumption. Eating rice from unregulated street vendors, where food may have been left exposed for long hours, should be avoided.\u201d\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nOther foods to avoid eating outside\n\nDr Srinivasan informs, \u201cOther foods that pose a high risk of bacterial contamination when eaten outside include raw salads, cut fruits, and undercooked meat and seafood. These foods may be washed with unclean water or stored in unhygienic conditions, increasing the likelihood of foodborne infections. To minimise the risk, it is best to opt for freshly prepared, thoroughly cooked meals and drink only filtered or boiled water when dining outside.\u201d",
