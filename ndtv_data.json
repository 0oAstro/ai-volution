    "raw_text": "Virat Kohli's cheap dismissal in the first innings of the Ranji Trophy match between Delhi and Railways triggered the iconic cricketer's fans, who decided to went their anger on social media. Kohli, making his return for Delhi in the Ranji Trophy after 13 years, was undone by a brilliant delivery from Railways pacer Himanshu Sangwan. As a result, Virat only lasted for 15 balls, scoring 6 runs in the process. Disappointed by Kohli's early dismissal, his fans tried to target Himanshu Sangwan on social media, but vented their anger on the wrong person.\n\nAnother Instagram user, by the name of Himanshu Sangwan, whose profile was public, suddenly experienced immense traffic on his account, while the comments section of his profile also got filled with hateful words from angry fans.\n\nThe person even shared a video and put status, saying he isn't the same Himanshu Sangwan who dismissed Kohli at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday.\n\nFor the 5000-odd crowd that assembled here to watch Kohli (6 off 15 balls), it was fun while it lasted but when he had his off-stump uprooted by Railways pacer Himanshu Sangwan in the 28th over of Delhi's first innings, a majority of them took no time to exit the Arun Jaitley Stadium.\n\nKohli came out to bat to a loud reception following the leg before dismissal of Yash Dhull at about 10.30am local time, which was an hour into day's play.\n\nIt was left-arm pacer Rahul Sharma who first got to bowl at the cricketing icon and with a spring in his stride, he bowled a yorker down the leg-side only to realise that he had overstepped.\n\nConsidering the batter in front, Rahul went for that little extra in his following ball and it turned out to be another no ball.\n\nIn the next over bowled by medium pacer Kunal Yadav, Kohli tried to assert himself and played and missed twice to balls pitched on his vulnerable zone -- wide outside the off-stump.\n\nAfter collecting two singles, Kohli decided to dominate the opposition -- right-arm pacer Sangwan in this particular over.\n\nStanding way outside the crease, Kohli disdainfully dispatched Sangwan towards the straight boundary.\n\nIt was still the first session and the ball was doing a bit but in his attempt to dominate Sangwan, the very next ball, Kohli went for an expansive drive off a good length delivery but missed it completely to see his off-stump shattered.\n\nThe ball seamed back in contributing to Kohli's downfall.\n\nHe had a quick look at the surface before trudging back to the pavilion and with him his sea of fans headed towards the exit door.\n\nWith PTI Inputs\n\nTopics mentioned in this article",

    "raw_text": "India's smartphone market saw nine percent year-on-year (YoY) revenue growth in 2024 on a wholesale price basis to reach a record high, as per a report by a market research firm. Samsung, which secured the top spot in the global smartphone market, slipped below Vivo and Xiaomi to third place in India's smartphone market. Apple had the highest market value share in the country with iPhone 15 becoming the highest-shipped smartphone of the fourth quarter (Q4) of the year.\n\nIndian Smartphone Market Registers Record Revenue Growth\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research report based on data from Counterpoint's Monthly India Smartphone Tracker, the wholesale smartphone market revenue in India grew 9 percent YoY in 2024, reaching an all-time high. A total of 153 million smartphone units were shipped in the year, seeing a relatively stable 1 percent YoY increase over 2023.\n\nThe year saw early growth, \"steady inventory levels and a favourable market outlook,\" as per the report but momentum slowed later in the year due to \"softened consumer demand and macroeconomic pressures.\" A strong \"premiumisation trend\" reportedly contributed to the record revenue levels.\n\nThe premium smartphone segment, which includes smartphones priced above Rs. 30,000, experienced double-digit percentage shipment growth in 2024, while the entry-level segment, with handsets under Rs. 10,000, saw a one-third decline, mostly due to the impact of inflation, according to the report.\n\nThe report further added that Vivo led the Indian smartphone market in volume for the first time, recording a 16 percent YoY growth. Another Chinese OEM, Xiaomi, secured the second spot and registered a 6 percent YoY increase in shipments. Meanwhile, Samsung slipped to third place even though its premium devices continued to perform well. This is a result of its \"value-driven strategies\" which impacted shipments of handsets in lower price segments, the report added.\n\nOppo ended up in fourth with a 10 percent YoY decline in shipments in the country but the brand regained momentum later in the year with new product launches. Apple ranked among the top five brands in India in Q4, with the iPhone 15 being the highest-shipped smartphone.\n\nNotably, Nothing was the fastest-growing brand, achieving a 577 percent YoY growth led by its Phone 2a series shipments. The report also mentioned Motorola, the brand that managed to double its 2022 shipments with an 82 percent YoY increase.\n\nMeanwhile, Realme strengthened its offline presence, with offline sales contributing 52 percent to its total shipments, up from 49 percent in 2023. In the feature phone market, Itel led with a 32 percent share with the help of its strong distribution network in tier-2 and smaller cities.\n\nAmong the market trends noted in the report is that in 2024, 5G smartphones accounted for 78 percent of total shipments, with three out of four smartphones shipped being 5G-supported handsets. This was majorly driven by the increasing availability of 5G chipsets in entry-level devices. Coming to chipsets, MediaTek led the market with a 52 percent share as Qualcomm followed at 25 percent.\n\nThe demand for premium smartphones continued to rise, with high-end devices making up 20 percent of total shipments, the report claimed. This growth was due to advancements in GenAI features, improved audio-visual technologies, and an increasing focus on content consumption and creation.\n\nIn Q4 2024, smartphone shipments declined by 4 percent YoY. This drop was due to a slowdown after the festive season. However, market value grew by 5 percent during the quarter. The rise in premium device demand helped drive this growth, according to the report.",

    "raw_text": "India's smartphone market saw nine percent year-on-year (YoY) revenue growth in 2024 on a wholesale price basis to reach a record high, as per a report by a market research firm. Samsung, which secured the top spot in the global smartphone market, slipped below Vivo and Xiaomi to third place in India's smartphone market. Apple had the highest market value share in the country with iPhone 15 becoming the highest-shipped smartphone of the fourth quarter (Q4) of the year.\n\nIndian Smartphone Market Registers Record Revenue Growth\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research report based on data from Counterpoint's Monthly India Smartphone Tracker, the wholesale smartphone market revenue in India grew 9 percent YoY in 2024, reaching an all-time high. A total of 153 million smartphone units were shipped in the year, seeing a relatively stable 1 percent YoY increase over 2023.\n\nThe year saw early growth, \"steady inventory levels and a favourable market outlook,\" as per the report but momentum slowed later in the year due to \"softened consumer demand and macroeconomic pressures.\" A strong \"premiumisation trend\" reportedly contributed to the record revenue levels.\n\nThe premium smartphone segment, which includes smartphones priced above Rs. 30,000, experienced double-digit percentage shipment growth in 2024, while the entry-level segment, with handsets under Rs. 10,000, saw a one-third decline, mostly due to the impact of inflation, according to the report.\n\nThe report further added that Vivo led the Indian smartphone market in volume for the first time, recording a 16 percent YoY growth. Another Chinese OEM, Xiaomi, secured the second spot and registered a 6 percent YoY increase in shipments. Meanwhile, Samsung slipped to third place even though its premium devices continued to perform well. This is a result of its \"value-driven strategies\" which impacted shipments of handsets in lower price segments, the report added.\n\nOppo ended up in fourth with a 10 percent YoY decline in shipments in the country but the brand regained momentum later in the year with new product launches. Apple ranked among the top five brands in India in Q4, with the iPhone 15 being the highest-shipped smartphone.\n\nNotably, Nothing was the fastest-growing brand, achieving a 577 percent YoY growth led by its Phone 2a series shipments. The report also mentioned Motorola, the brand that managed to double its 2022 shipments with an 82 percent YoY increase.\n\nMeanwhile, Realme strengthened its offline presence, with offline sales contributing 52 percent to its total shipments, up from 49 percent in 2023. In the feature phone market, Itel led with a 32 percent share with the help of its strong distribution network in tier-2 and smaller cities.\n\nAmong the market trends noted in the report is that in 2024, 5G smartphones accounted for 78 percent of total shipments, with three out of four smartphones shipped being 5G-supported handsets. This was majorly driven by the increasing availability of 5G chipsets in entry-level devices. Coming to chipsets, MediaTek led the market with a 52 percent share as Qualcomm followed at 25 percent.\n\nThe demand for premium smartphones continued to rise, with high-end devices making up 20 percent of total shipments, the report claimed. This growth was due to advancements in GenAI features, improved audio-visual technologies, and an increasing focus on content consumption and creation.\n\nIn Q4 2024, smartphone shipments declined by 4 percent YoY. This drop was due to a slowdown after the festive season. However, market value grew by 5 percent during the quarter. The rise in premium device demand helped drive this growth, according to the report.",

    "raw_text": "Mistral, the Paris-based artificial intelligence (AI) firm, released the Mistral Small 3 AI model on Thursday. The company, known for its open-source large language models (LLMs), has also made the latest AI model available on Hugging Face as well as several other platforms. Mistral claimed that the latest model was built with processing speed, efficiency, and performance in mind, and it can outperform models double its size. The AI firm's internal testing found the model to offer better performance than OpenAI's GPT-4o mini.\n\nMistral Small 3 AI Model Released\n\nIn a newsroom post, the French AI firm detailed the new AI model. Mistral Small 3 is a latency-optimised model with 24 billion parameters. The LLM is being released with both a pre-trained and an instruction-tuned checkpoint to cater to a wide range of tasks. The AI model is available under the Apache 2.0 licence for academic and commercial usage. Mistral highlighted that it is moving away from the Mistral Research Licence (MRL) model that only allows academic and research-related usage.\n\nThe company stated that the AI model is neither trained with the reinforcement learning (RL) process nor includes synthetic data (data generated from other AI models or digital sources) in the training dataset.\n\nBased on internal tests, the AI firm claimed that Mistral Small 3 outperforms GPT-4o mini in terms of latency. It also performed better than the OpenAI LLM on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) Pro and the Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A (GPQA) main benchmarks. The developers also revealed that the model is competitive with the Llama 3.3 70B model, despite being three times smaller.\n\nAs per the company, this model can be used for use cases where efficiency or speed matters to developers. Some of the suggested use cases include scenarios where fast-response conversational assistance is critical, scenarios where low-latency function calling is important, or scenarios where developers want to create a chatbot that is subject matter expert by fine-tuning the LLM.",
