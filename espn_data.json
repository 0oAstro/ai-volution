    "raw_text": "The first time I saw Goff play quarterback, he was a sophomore in high school, so skinny he had to wave his arms to make a shadow. Even then, with his Marin Catholic jersey billowing around him, the ball left his hand and traveled audibly through the air, and those watching lifted their heads and tracked it in dumbstruck silence, none more helplessly than the thick-ankled defensive backs trying to track it down.\n\nThrough 39 wins over three varsity seasons, a silly percentage of his throws ended with the receiver jogging into the end zone and Goff jogging nonchalantly to the sideline in that same upright two-beat trot you see now, as if throwing 50-yard touchdowns was just another way to spend an afternoon. He always gave the impression he was waiting around for something that -- finally -- might be worth celebrating.\n\n\"I've always said the same thing about Jared,\" says his father, Jerry, a former big league catcher. \"If you walk into a stadium in the fourth quarter and you had no idea what was going on, you wouldn't know if he had thrown four touchdowns or four picks.\"\n\nNow the game is infinitely faster, the men playing it so big and strong they can be mistaken for machines moving across a screen. Goff has traveled the distance from skinny to thin -- \"I know how to fall\" is how he explains his durability -- as his game has embarked on a consistently upward trajectory. The Rams, 11-5 last season, were stung by the wild-card home playoff loss to the Falcons; after a revelatory second season -- 3,804 yards and 28 TDs -- Goff started slowly in his first playoff game and never got rolling. This year, after an 8-1 start, the memory of that loss had him eager to talk about the one or two games in which the Rams' offense started slowly before starting to roll. He roams the sideline during the slow times repeating the same message: \"It'll pop.\" In every game, even the Week 9 loss at New Orleans, he's been correct.\n\nThere's a common reason prescribed when young QBs start reading defenses and identifying coverages and throwing to the right receiver through the narrowest of slots. McVay says it first: \"The game is slowing down for Jared.\" It's accepted wisdom, but in reality the only way for the game to seem slower to the quarterback is for the quarterback's brain -- through repetition and recognition -- to accelerate.\n\n\"If I can look out over a defense and say, 'That route's not going to be there,' then I don't need to spend a lot of time on it,\" Goff says. \"It allows me to get through everything a little quicker.\"\n\nThat works well with McVay, who coaches like he's always trying to beat the yellow. He plays defensive back against his receivers at practice and talks so fast that punctuation never has a chance. He exists in the realm of lines and angles, the world an equation that must be solved before time runs out.\n\n\"He does something every day to amaze me,\" offensive tackle Rob Havenstein says. \"The details he picks up are incredible. He'll pop into our meetings and tell us why we're doing this or how we're changing this. He'll leave, and we'll sit there and look at each other for a minute, shaking our heads, and then someone will say, 'Yeah, that'll work.'\"\n\nThe NFL has become a cult of coaches and quarterbacks. You can't win without a guy who can play the position and a guy who can teach it. One has to be able to command a room, the other a huddle. The Rams are unique; Goff and McVay's combined age (56) is 10 years less than Bill Belichick's, and McVay, at 32, is younger than two of his starting offensive linemen.\n\n\"I don't think you can put an age to what his brain does,\" says center John Sullivan, who is five months older than McVay. \"His brain is just his brain. It could be 10 or 110 -- doesn't matter. Not everything around here fits with tradition when it comes to age.\"\n\nI ask McVay if he can cite specific throws Goff has made this season that show his growth. It feels a little cheap, like a dad asking his kid to recite baseball stats at a holiday party, but let's face it: The temptation is too great. McVay, famously, is someone who can be asked about random plays and recount the details like they're the names of his siblings, so asking him to provide some concrete examples of his quarterback's improvement seems like an ethical imperative.\n\nHe doesn't have to think. The throw is right there, playing on a screen in his mind:\n\n\"I look at the timing and rhythm with which he threw Josh Reynolds his second touchdown against the Packers,\" he begins, setting the scene from the Rams' Week 8 win. \"You want to be able to throw that three-stage footwork -- he tempos his drop on a three-step-from-the-gun footwork and lets it go when his back foot hits, recognizing the coverage concept. The difference between taking that and taking a hitch is a catch-tackle, or maybe a catch-incompletion, and a touchdown with a catch-transition.\"\n\nAnimation courtesy of NFL Next Gen Stats\n\nI should probably tell McVay he's giving me too much credit with this explanation, but interrupting him when he's talking football seems like an unforgivable transgression. The way it looked to the untrained eye, though, tight end Tyler Higbee ran a short sit-down route to Goff's right, and Reynolds ran a deep slant in the seam behind Higbee. Just as a linebacker drifted toward Higbee, Reynolds split the two deep safeties and turned to find the ball arriving in his hands. Reynolds' explanation is less technical than McVay's, but it requires its own level of translation. \"Once I saw the dime linebacker sit on the cheese [Higbee; think mousetrap], I knew the ball was coming before I laid eyes on Jared,\" Reynolds says. \"As soon as I turned, the ball was on me.\" McVay was suggesting that last season Goff might have settled for the first open man -- Higbee -- for a modest gain, rather than waiting that extra second -- with the rush coming -- to see the play through to its greatest glory.\n\n\"In play-action, we run a lot of what we call three-level throws,\" Goff says. \"Usually, it's something vertical, something intermediate and then something like a checkdown to a running back or a tight end. When I was just starting to understand things last year, it might have been\" -- here he nods his head three times while moving his eyes higher each time -- \"one-two-three. Mechanical. Now I can see before the snap: OK, that deep ball is probably not going to be open, so this throw is probably going to the intermediate guy. You start to play the percentages, see what's most likely going to take place.\"\n\nThe Rams won their first eight games for the first time since 1969 because the roster is loaded with great players: Todd Gurley is an MVP favorite (along with Mahomes), and Goff is in the conversation; Aaron Donald could repeat as defensive player of the year; Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods are on track for 1,000-yard seasons, as was Cooper Kupp before a season-ending knee injury. Reynolds, who will move into Kupp's role as Goff's third receiver, cites a less obvious reason why the Rams have been able to keep defenses guessing. \"We're a really smart team,\" he says. \"Everybody in here is smart, and that makes a difference.\"\n\nThe Rams' extensive playbook grows as the season wears on. McVay is free to introduce concepts midseason and knows they'll be understood. \"Obviously, we're expected to know the plays,\" Havenstein says. \"But they've been teaching us more about the why of it -- why we block a certain defense a certain way, why a certain play will work when the defense gives us a certain look. When you understand something, it makes it easier to add new stuff.\"\n\nEach week, they're being taken deeper and deeper into McVay's brain, a hoarder's garage of expansive concepts, granular diagrams and, not least of all, slogans -- \"We Not Me,\" \"You Know What You Know,\" \"The Standard Is the Standard.\" Those words can seem meaningless from the outside -- a mind-numbing expansion of the it is what it is culture -- but within the team, they represent a shared language to wall off intruders. You know what you know is McVay's way of saying, We know what nobody else does.\n\n\"I feel like I get a pretty good look inside his mind,\" Sullivan says. \"He's a freak -- in a good way. I've seen the videos of him reciting plays.\"\n\nGuard Rodger Saffold, at the next locker, interjects to tell Sullivan, \"Just like you.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not like that,\" Sullivan says. \"Not like that.\"\n\n\"Don't let him fool you,\" Saffold says to me. \"He remembers, yeah he does. 'Hey, do you remember that play from 2009?' That's this guy right here.\"\n\n\"Nah,\" Sullivan says, embarrassed. \"I can recall certain things. Probably not the way [McVay] can, though. I don't think anybody can.\"\n\nThe sibilant hiss of the word manages to compound the insult: System quarterback. Was it inevitable? Did McVay's ascendance require that Goff become an extension of his coach and not the curator of his own talent? Before the Rams' Week 7 game in Santa Clara, I listened to a 49ers radio analyst say that Goff couldn't throw a spiral before McVay showed up. And two weeks later, before Goff had thrown a pass against the Saints, Fox's Troy Aikman said, \"When [Goff] signs his next contract, he should give Sean McVay 10 percent.\"\n\nThe storyline began to develop a year ago, when the Great Helmet Communication Conspiracy opened a window for those who were seeking sorcery behind McVay's methods. Goff was miked during a game, and McVay's voice could be heard in the background as Goff stood at the line and surveyed the defense. \"People misconstrued it,\" McVay says. \"They thought, 'All right, they're just getting to the line and telling him what to do.'\" The communication between the coach and the quarterback cuts off when the play clock reaches 15 seconds, and McVay says, \"Jared's making all the calls. He has the mastery of the offense.\"\n\nSystem quarterback?\n\n\"To call him that is a discredit to all the good things he's doing,\" McVay says. \"As coaches, you want to be able to put your players in a system that's conducive to their success. But there are 32 guys in the world that are starting quarterbacks, and it's a very, very elite group. And then to play at the level he's playing is really impressive -- the level of throws, the understanding of what defenses are trying to present, the off-schedule plays he's able to make in rhythm. I think sometimes that is received as, 'Well, a lot of guys can do what he's doing,' and I just don't think that's the case. I think he's doing some special stuff, and I think as a result of him playing quarterback he makes it a good system.\"\n\n\u0093He's doing some special stuff, and I think as a result of him playing quarterback, he makes it a good system.\u0094\n\n- Sean McVay\n\nThe system runs on balance, in scheme and in personality. \"I think sometimes I can get too excited,\" McVay says, \"and the consistency of Jared's demeanor helps me keep it in perspective. I look at him during games, so composed and refreshingly secure in himself, and I have to remind myself: Hey, that's what you want to be.\"\n\nAnd while he's at it, McVay wants to know the system that could conjure what he saw in Minnesota, when Goff completed 26 of 33 passes for 465 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions. It was one of just 49 perfect quarterback ratings (158.3) in the NFL since 1950. Only three of those were by quarterbacks with at least 30 passes thrown, and of all of them, Goff has the most yards and is tied for the most completions.\n\nStatistically it could have been the best quarterback performance in history, and there was one throw in particular that nobody could believe. Late in the first half, with the Vikings leading by three and the Rams at the Vikings' 19-yard line, Goff rolled far to his right and lofted a pass off one foot. \"He's throwing it away,\" Rams quarterback coach Zac Taylor thought to himself, adding now, \"I was thinking about the next play.\" Instead, Goff was throwing a geometrically perfect pass -- the angle, velocity and location -- that somehow scissored between two defenders and landed in the hands of Cooper Kupp in the back corner of the end zone.\n\nAnimation courtesy of NFL Next Gen Stats\n\nIn short, says Taylor: \"It was one of the most remarkable passes I've ever seen.\"\n\nLess than 48 hours after the Rams have defeated the Packers on the last Sunday in October, Goff is being photographed as he walks around the team's complex in Thousand Oaks. November is two days away, yet the temperature is in the high 80s, the Santa Ana winds crackling through the hills like radio static. Locals instinctively check the hillsides, expecting smoke.\n\nThe Rams are the last undefeated team in the NFL, a few days away from their first loss, and Goff's most immediate concern is a stamp on the underside of his wrist from a Halloween party the night before that everybody keeps mistaking -- annoyingly -- for a tattoo. There's also a wrap on his left ankle and yellowing bruises on his left biceps. When the photographer asks him to sit on a curb for a pensive shot, he starts to bend down and then stops. \"Can't do that,\" he says, shaking his head. Asked why, he laughs and says, \"It's Tuesday.\" It's the only explanation needed. A few minutes later, he winces as he pulls on his jersey and pads. Task complete, he exhales the way you do when you finally catch your breath. \"I'm only 24,\" he says, \"but it's Week 9, without a bye.\"\n\nSo much of the job is appearances. Quarterbacks like Matt Ryan stroll into a postgame news conference dressed like CEOs. Cam Newton does one thing, Aaron Rodgers another. Everyone has a brand, and Goff's can be loosely described as informal star. \"Cali cool,\" Taylor calls it. When Goff first came into the league, he would arrive for a game, unbutton the first two buttons of his dress shirt, pull it over his head and bury it on the floor of his locker. So when he took to the podium after a game, he always looked a little like he was wearing ... well, a shirt that had been buried at the bottom of a locker.\n\nHe's more particular now -- he uses hangers, and his mom helps him with his outfits for home games -- but every once in a while, Jerry will dare to venture into the unknown.\n\n\"Jared, how about a suit this week?\"\n\n\"Nah, Dad, I'm good.\"\n\nJust two years ago, Goff was called a bust, and worse. (\"You know what you know\" is how he describes that situation.) Last year was his quiet rebuttal, but this one feels like an arrival: second only to Mahomes in passing yards through nine games, on the short list for MVP, leading a team that expects to play through January. He has helped to change the paradigm; he is part of the revolution.\n\nIt can be hard to tell. Goff's organic nonchalance transcends circumstance and outcome. Against the Saints, with just under 10 minutes left, he threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to Kupp to put the Rams a two-point conversion away from erasing a three-touchdown deficit. His reaction? The same as the one against Minnesota, and the same as the one throughout high school, which is to say almost no reaction at all. His dad says the most emotion he's seen from his son came in Seattle, after a successful quarterback sneak on fourth down late in the game clinched the Rams' fifth win. Havenstein, the offensive tackle, sits at his locker and mimics the most effusive Goff celebration with an almost apologetic fist pump and a strangled \"Yuh!\" It's modesty, sure, but that's only part of it. It's how confidence looks when someone is still waiting for a moment he deems worthy of celebrating.",

    "raw_text": "No NBA player is dishing more assists in the league than Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young. No one is scoring more points on the Hawks than the three-time NBA All-Star. And no one will see Young in the 2025 NBA All-Star Game after he was perhaps the biggest of all the All-Star snubs.\n\nYoung is having arguably his most well-rounded NBA season, averaging 22.7 points, a career-high 11.4 assists, 3.3 rebounds and 2.9 3-pointers made per game. But that wasn\u2019t enough for the Hawks star to land one of the seven coveted NBA Eastern Conference All-Star reserve slots revealed Thursday. Hurting Young\u2019s All-Star candidacy was the injury-plagued team\u2019s 22-25 record.\n\nTwenty-four All-Stars will be among four teams competing in three games in a new format during the 2025 NBA All-Star Game on Feb. 16 at Chase Center in San Francisco. NBA fans, media and players selected the starters Jan. 23. The reserves for both conferences, as selected by the respective conference coaches, were revealed Thursday.\n\nOnce again, Andscape presents its annual NBA All-Snub team, our squad of the most deserving players who didn\u2019t make the cut. And just imagine how different this All-Star snub list could\u2019ve been if Joel Embiid, Chet Holmgren, Ja Morant, Zion Williamson, Luka Don\u010di\u0107, Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were healthy most of the season.\n\nLaMelo Ball, guard, Charlotte Hornets\n\nBall, fourth in the NBA in points per game (28.2), is quite popular with the NBA\u2019s younger generation due to his fun, up-tempo street ball style of play and Magic Johnson-esque passing. But Ball\u2019s Hornets owning one of the NBA\u2019s worst records (12-32) certainly ruined his candidacy.\n\nDevin Booker, guard, Phoenix Suns\n\nStatistically, Booker definitely is deserving as he is 11th in the NBA in scoring at 25.5 points per game and 12th in assists per game with 6.7. With Suns teammate Kevin Durant an All-Star starter, Booker was likely a victim of being on a team that West coaches probably feel didn\u2019t deserve two All-Stars due to their average 24-22 record.\n\nKyrie Irving, guard, Dallas Mavericks\n\nIrving is averaging 24.2 points per game, which is more than All-Stars Jaylen Brown, Stephen Curry, Darius Garland, James Harden, Tyler Herro, Jaren Jackson Jr., LeBron James, Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, Alperen Sengun, Pascal Siakam and Jalen Williams. The eight-time NBA All-Star last played in the midseason classic in 2023.\n\nZach LaVine, guard, Chicago Bulls\n\nDespite being in trade rumors all season long, a healthy and high flying LaVine is averaging 24 points per game. The Bulls, however, didn\u2019t help his cause with a dismal 20-28 record.\n\nTyrese Maxey, guard, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nMaxey not making the All-Star Game could be one of the biggest snubs considering he is sixth in the league in scoring (27.1 points per game) and the only light in a dark season for the Sixers. The East head coaches must\u2019ve held Philadelphia\u2019s 19-27 record against him.\n\nNorman Powell, guard, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nPowell has been one of the NBA\u2019s surprise stars this season, averaging a team-best and career-high 24 points per game. Powell, however, does not get rewarded with his first-ever All-Star appearance in his best NBA season.\n\nDomantas Sabonis, center, Sacramento Kings\n\nSabonis gets snubbed for the second year in a row despite averaging an NBA-best 42 double-doubles and 14.5 rebounds per game to go with 20.9 points and 6.6 assists per contest. It\u2019s hard to make sense of this snub as the only things that could have been held against the three-time NBA All-Star with huge numbers is the Kings\u2019 24-23 record and in-season drama.\n\nKings guard De\u2019Aaron Fox was also a candidate, but there was no way the franchise was going to land two All-Star selections.",

While most fight videos that Vlad or Vova or Anton share are several minutes long -- the formula seems to include the walk-up, the two sides slamming into each other and several angles of subsequent action so as to include at least a couple of head-stomps -- the few that Bulldog offers last only about 10 seconds and feature just a few violent sequences set to heavy metal music.\n\nAt first glance, they look like rudimentary highlight videos, the rough equivalent of a hooligan's video r\u00e9sum\u00e9; yet after a few viewings, with the opportunity to look more closely and notice the lack of technique or the unusual surroundings or the way it seems as if the fighting sequences are just a little too dramatic, another interpretation seems possible.\n\nThey are homages.\n\nThis shouldn't be surprising. After all, there is a popular website, fanstyle.ru, dedicated to full coverage of hooligan fighting. There are thousands of fight videos on the internet. There are message boards all over the Russian version of Facebook, with thread after thread where pictures of injuries from fights are posted and analyzed in the comments. In 2013, a feature-length Russian movie, Okolofutbola, which glorified the new hooligan lifestyle (and used hooligans in some of the roles), was a massive hit in Russia.\n\nAll of it combined has spawned more than just this movement's growing number of fights and fighters; there is also a growing number of boys like Bulldog who want to be what they see on the computer. Many of those injury threads on social media devolve into debates over whether the people who posted the photos actually suffered their injuries in a real fight or simply, say, gouged their own forehead with a blade to make it appear as if they had been in the woods.\n\nIs Bulldog a real hooligan? Has he really punched someone? I don't know, but I keep going back to that moment on the first day with him, when I asked, \"What is your goal?\" and he answered with three things.\n\n\"My goal is to be stronger,\" he said. \"To be bigger. To be cooler.\"\n\nTo be cooler.\n\nThis is, I suppose, what makes the Russian authorities so concerned about the new hooligan movement as the World Cup approaches. Sure, Russian hooligans generally say they don't want to fight regular fans. They say they want to fight other hooligans (unless, maybe, you're English, in which case they might want to fight you just because they assume you're a hooligan too). The casual, there-for-a-good-time soccer fans at the World Cup really shouldn't need to be worried about groups such as Rude Boys or the Legion or RB Warriors.\n\nExcept, well, nothing is quite so clear-cut. This is Russia and this is underground fighting, so there is always an inherent unpredictability. And with this particular movement, much of that unpredictability exists on the fringes, among those who are peering over the top of the fence, desperate to get inside.\n\n\"Do you think there will be problems at the World Cup?\" I ask Arnie during a coffee break at a bar near his gym. He shrugs. \"I would say no,\" he says, \"but there is always something that no one sees coming. That only God sees. What will it be?\"\n\nHis guess is it will be the loose cannons, the unattached hooligans, the splinter groups looking to make a name. And all I can think of is when Bulldog offered to beat up that man on the street.\n\nIgor Lebedev, a top Russian politician who is also part of the Russian soccer federation's executive committee, believes the government's attempt to crack down on woods fighting might be counterproductive (and hopeless). He believes there could be value in the government sanctioning woods fighting instead, regulating it and organizing it and, essentially, turning it into a real sport.\n\nHe goes on about this one evening at his office near Red Square in Moscow, and he looks hurt when I am skeptical. \"It's hard for me to imagine,\" I begin, trying to choose my words carefully, \"why you think that would be a good idea.\"\n\nHe says that the fighting and punching and brawling and scrapping is unavoidable. That it is hardwired. That, especially in a country where the winters are long and dark, it is standard. \"We should all understand,\" he says, \"that there are simply things in life we cannot escape.\"\n\nThat word -- escape -- gives me pause. I didn't hit Artie 25 years ago and have wondered forever how my life would have been different if I had. Bulldog talks as though his hands have blood smeared all over them and always will. Vlad and Vova and Ruslan and Anton punch people in their sleep. So which of us escaped?\n\nOne night in Moscow, I meet up with a hooligan named Kostya. It is bitterly cold, so we talk in the dark, dank (but less-than-freezing) stairwell of his friend's apartment building. Kostya adores fighting, and the scars on his hands have scars of their own. He talks about the warrior spirit that leads men to fighting and makes fun of the youngest woods fighters who like to post their fight videos on the internet. He laughs.\n\nThen he listens, patiently and kindly, as I tell him that even after spending all this time with hooligans and learning about what they do and how they do it, I still don't understand why they do it.\n\nI ask: \"Can you explain why you fight?\"\n\n\"For fun,\" he says simply.\n\n\"Is it fun?\"\n\nKostya laughs. \"Of course.\"\n\nI poke the ground with my toe and shuffle my shoes. I'm stalling, trying to keep from offending this nice hooligan with my pathetic confession. Kostya lets the silence linger. Finally, I blurt out \"I've never punched anybody in my life\" and stare at the ground.\n\nI have said it to others, of course, and await the snicker or titter or cackle. But Kostya isn't like Vlad or Vova or Anton or Ruslan. He doesn't treat it as a joke or a gag or some sort of fatal flaw. Instead, he just nods and genuinely considers this bizarre reality, imagining what that could possibly be like. He goes silent for a beat or two or three.\n\nThen he waits until I raise my head and looks at me, his face cocked just slightly to the side. He straightens his shoulders. His gaze is steady, his eyes softer than my knuckles.\n\n\"You should try it.\"\n\nPatrick Reevell contributed reporting.",

    "raw_text": "A year after Jason's death, Emmitt and Charlotte began the Jason Kendall Ray Foundation. The organization has raised more than half a million dollars to help families of those who need transplants, be it funds for a hotel stay or gas card or even to help make a house or car payment while a recipient recovers from surgery. In April 2016, UNC Hospitals renamed its transplant center the Jason Ray Transplant Clinic. Inside the door of the clinic, there is a portrait of Jason and a plaque commemorating his selfless act. Emmitt Ray was visiting the clinic one day last year when he was caught off guard by a nurse answering the phone: \"Good morning, Jason Ray Transplant Clinic.\"\n\n\"I lost it,\" Emmitt says. \"It just sort of hits you.\"\n\nBefore the Duke-Carolina football game in September, the university surprised the Rays by bringing them onto the field to announce that a \"JR\" patch would be added to the uniforms of both Rameses and Rameses Jr. for the rest of the school year. Emmitt and Charlotte couldn't have been more proud. As they posed for pictures with the current Rameses, Charlotte rested her head on his shoulder. To everyone else, it's just the Carolina mascot. But to the Rays, the young man in that suit stirs vivid memories of their son.\n\n\"Sure it's weird,\" Emmitt said. \"We always think of him when we see Rameses. But everyone who has put on that costume after Jason, they have always treated us like royalty.\"\n\nBut it is in that bedroom at the top of the stairs where Jason is remembered -- and honored -- most. Every month, Charlotte switches the quilts made from Jason's T-shirts. She sits in that chair, closes her eyes and pictures her boy asking when they can go to the library to check out more books.\n\nNot a day goes by that Jason's name doesn't come up, Charlotte says. She and Emmitt agree that Jason's decision to become a donor -- and the far-reaching impact of that decision -- has made it easier. That doesn't mean they wouldn't trade it all to have their son back.\n\n\"We still have our moments,\" Emmitt says. \"But I think we're doing OK.\"\n\nAdded Charlotte: \"I never thought I'd be where I'm at today. I didn't think I could exist without Jason. But all these great memories I have, that's what's carried me through.\"\n\nStephanie Griffin\n\nWidow of heart recipient\n\nAs the clouds begin to fade and the late-afternoon sun shines on the somber cemetery grounds, Stephanie Griffin strolls along the freshly cut grass searching for Plot 4458, the final resting place of her husband, Ronald.\n\nIt's been six years since Ronald Griffin died in his New Jersey home from heart and kidney failure, but this is Stephanie's first time visiting his grave.\n\n\"There were so many times I wanted to come,\" she says. \"But I just couldn't do it. My daughter and I would say we were going to come, and then it wouldn't happen. I guess I tried to hold on to the life part of it, not the death.\"\n\nBut on this day, she finally feels ready. With each step, the numbers climb, 4441, 4442, 4443 ... \"We're getting closer,\" she says. She carefully walks between the gravestones. Two more rows. And then she sees it. In a row all by itself.\n\nRONALD GRIFFIN\n\nMM3 US NAVY\n\nVIETNAM\n\nMAR 11 1949 MAY 25 2011\n\nALWAYS IN OUR HEART\n\nStephanie kneels down and picks up a purple piece of fabric that has landed on the grave. She rips away patches of crabgrass that have grown around the gravestone's edges. A tear begins to fall.\n\n\"It's just the fact that he didn't make it,\" she says. \"But he really enjoyed the time he was here. He enjoyed people. He enjoyed life. He was always joking around. He's probably joking around right now.\"\n\nIt was in March 2007, after 13 years of battling congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy, that Griffin received Jason Ray's heart. At the time, he couldn't walk or talk. And he could barely breathe. The only thing keeping him alive was a left ventricle assist device that pumped his heart for him. But in his four years after the transplant, everything changed. Ronald went for walks. He refused to miss a family reunion or party. And instead of always focusing on the past, he soaked up every second of the present, snapping photos of flowers or parks or anything in life that grabbed him.\n\n\"He wanted to preserve every memory,\" Stephanie says. \"He did everything he could to hold on to his second chance and cherish the things most people take for granted.\"\n\nIn the wake of the transplant, the Griffins built a friendship with Jason's parents. Together they would travel the country speaking about the gift of organ donation. Every month, Stephanie would have $50 automatically withdrawn from her bank account for a donation to the Jason Ray Foundation. Those donations still happen today. \"It's the absolute least I can do,\" she says.\n\nIn 2009, Ronald Griffin's kidneys began to fail and he ended up on dialysis. Two years after that, when Stephanie was returning to New Jersey from their granddaughter's graduation in North Carolina, Ronald failed to show up for dialysis and was found unresponsive at home. The theme of the funeral was \"Pass It On,\" a tribute to Jason. Before Ronald's casket was closed a final time, Stephanie placed a UNC decal inside.\n\n\"He and Jason were together forever even before Ronald died,\" Stephanie says. \"That bond was from day one and will never end.\"\n\nStephanie stands up and stares at her husband's grave. She talks about how proud he was to be in the Navy and how he always wanted a small anchor on his necklace to commemorate the time he served. But he never got one. After he died, Stephanie bought a tiny anchor that spins around her bracelet. \"It catches on my clothes all the time,\" she says. \"I know that's Ronald tugging at me.\"\n\nBefore she says goodbye, promising to return soon, Stephanie kneels before her husband's grave one last time. She spots a small hole at the base of the granite stone. \"This must be to put a flag in,\" she says. \"Don't worry, Ronald, I'll bring you a flag.\"\n\nSix days later, and 500 miles to the south, Stephanie stands behind a lectern at the Carolina Club on the UNC Chapel Hill campus during a fundraiser for Jason's foundation. She shares Ronald's story. She thanks Emmitt and Charlotte for the four extra years their son gave her husband, and for their friendship. When she finishes speaking, everyone in the room stands to applaud. It is the only standing ovation of the night. As she walks back to her seat, she stops to hug Emmitt and Charlotte. She has but one thought: She wishes Ronald were here to do the same.\n\nDavid Erving\n\nKidney and pancreas recipient\n\nTen years after David Erving received a kidney and pancreas from Jason Ray, his prognosis is as promising as ever. \"The doctors are amazed,\" Erving says. \"They've told me I could go another 20 years.\" Erving, who is 50, has battled diabetes since he was 13 and now lives in a senior-living apartment complex, where he has become the unofficial maintenance man, installing air conditioners and replacing lightbulbs for elderly neighbors. \"I don't ask for money,\" he says. \"I just like to help.\" Erving had testicular cancer in 2010 but says he has been doing fantastic ever since. He calls Emmitt and Charlotte Ray every couple of weeks and sends them a card with a picture of himself on every holiday. His bowed leg has been surgically repaired, and he walks 5 miles twice a week. It takes him three to four hours. \"I love it,\" he says.\n\nDennis Korzelius\n\nLiver recipient\n\nLife has not been easy for Dennis Korzelius since his liver transplant 10 years ago. Korzelius, now 53, says he has been in and out of the hospital more than 20 times in the past decade, with everything from pancreatitis to blood clots to complications from diabetes he contracted after the transplant. \"If there's a 1-in-10 chance of getting something, I'm going to be the guy who gets it,\" he says. \"My friends call me indestructible. My wife says the devil doesn't want me yet.\" Korzelius, who was married two months before his transplant, has since been divorced and remarried. Though the scar from his transplant has faded, its importance to him hasn't. \"I wear it with pride,\" he says. \"Without this scar, the only scar I would have is the one where they opened me up to throw all my s--- away.\"\n\nAntwan Hunter\n\nKidney recipient\n\n(In the decade since receiving Jason Ray's kidney, Antwan Hunter has grown up to become a father and soon, he'll become a husband. But his health prognosis is as uncertain as ever. In this letter to Jason, as told to ESPN's Wayne Drehs, Antwan explains what went wrong and why he again finds himself waiting for that special phone call.)\n\nDear Jason,\n\nI'm sorry. Twelve years ago you made the selfless decision to become an organ donor, a decision that saved my life. You and I never knew each other, but after your fatal accident in March of 2007, I received one of your kidneys. We were forever linked. And my life would never be the same.\n\nAfter the transplant, I felt like Superman. A rock star. I was 16 back then. I had lived with one functioning kidney since birth, and the second failed when I was a teenager. But your gift was a dream come true. I could play basketball and football and work out. Classmates would ask me for my autograph.\n\nNow, a decade later, I'm 26. I have two precious little girls, Jaelyn, who is 4, and Amya, who is 2. I'm engaged to be married next summer to the woman of my dreams, Cecily Derrick. But life is far from perfect. For the past year and a half, I've struggled to tell your mom and dad what's going on with me. I've started emails and then deleted them. I've picked up the phone and put it back down. I didn't know how to tell them. I didn't know what to say. The truth is that your kidney has failed. And I blame myself.\n\nBack when I was a teenager, there were days when I would feel so good, so normal, I would skip my rejection medicine and not think twice about it. Later, I started taking generic medicines from two different pharmacies. They didn't work together the way doctors prescribed, and by the time I realized this could be a problem, it was too late.\n\nI never felt sick or tired. There were never any symptoms that anything was wrong. But two years ago, I contracted a urinary tract infection. In the hospital, my creatinine levels spiked. And the next thing I knew, doctors told me your kidney had failed. And there was nothing they could do to save it. I went into a deep depression, wondering why this had happened to me. One doctor told me they couldn't find any anti-rejection medicine in my system. He accused me of not taking the medicine at all. It wasn't true. Did I miss a dose here or there? Absolutely. I know now it was dumb. But I never quit the medicine altogether. Another doctor told me I shouldn't have mixed the medicines. And another said the medicine could have had nothing to do with it -- my body could have just rejected the kidney.\n\nWhatever the reason, in May 2016, I joined more than half a million other Americans battling kidney failure. Three days a week, I wake up at 4:45 in the morning to head to the local dialysis center near my home in Irvington, New Jersey. There, my blood is cycled through a machine and cleaned for four hours. The dialysis is draining. It's as if I am a superhero and the dialysis is my kryptonite taking my powers away. I hate needles. Always have. Now they're a constant part of my life. I'm on a strictly portioned diet, and I'm not allowed to drink more than seven cups of fluid a day. I don't urinate anymore. That's weird. And because of the port in my chest, I can't take a shower. I just sit in the bath and my fianc\u00e9e helps me wash my upper body with a washcloth.\n\nI wish I could find a time machine to go back and tell 16-year-old Antwan to get it together, to do everything in his power to protect your kidney. Instead, I'm again on the list waiting for a transplant. My mom and I have traveled to register on the various recipient lists in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and yes, North Carolina. In North Carolina, we visited your transplant clinic. Your photo on the wall gave me chills. I felt so incredibly guilty.\n\nNot a day goes by that I don't think about you. Every night you are in my prayers. I don't know if you can hear me, but the message is always the same: \"Thank you. And I'm sorry.\" You gave me so much. And I feel like I let you down. That's why I haven't reached out to your mom and dad in so long. What would I say? I don't even know the words. For so long, I just wanted to crawl in a hole and hide.\n\nThankfully, my daughters and my fianc\u00e9e pulled me out of that funk. In church, I prayed over my guilt. And realized I needed to pick myself up. I needed to fight. And that's when my mom and I started getting back on these lists, to see if my prayers could be answered one more time.\n\nTwice now I've gotten the call that they've found a match, there's a kidney for me. But both times bloodwork revealed that my antibodies were too high. My body was likely to reject a new kidney. So it went to someone else.\n\nI don't know what's going to happen. I just try to stay positive, hoping there will be a medicine or a treatment that will bring my antibodies down so, if I ever get that call again, my body will be ready. This time I know I won't make the mistakes of the past. This time I know my luck will be different.\n\nPeople have told me that transplants are often hardest on teenagers. They're old enough to understand what's happening yet not mature enough to handle it. I try not to think about that. I don't make excuses. Instead I focus on taking care of my body and helping others learn from my mistakes. I know I need to be here for my girls. That's my motivation.\n\nLate last month, I was at a health fair when I ran into a representative from the New Jersey Sharing Network. His name was Keath Gerald -- your mom and dad and I spoke at his school in New Jersey back in 2007. At the health fair, Keath looked at me like a celebrity. We took a selfie. And he asked if I would be interested in speaking. I told him absolutely. And a week later I was on stage at that same high school talking about the importance of organ donation and making the most out of every opportunity in life.\n\nIn the end, I just wanted to say thank you for the blessing you gave me. Your kidney helped me become a father. Soon I'm going to be a husband. My family is my world. I can't imagine life without them. So thank you.\n\nAnd again, I'm sorry. I plan to call your mom and dad and tell them the exact same thing. As a parent, I get it now. I can't imagine what they've gone through. But I want to talk to them. I want to go visit them in North Carolina at your home.\n\nUntil then, just know that I won't stop fighting. Regardless of what has happened inside me, you're my brother for life. Nothing will change that. And I owe it to you, your parents and my family to fight as hard as I can, as long as I can, until the day that phone call comes.",

    "raw_text": "This is the cover story of ESPN The Magazine's Nov. 13 QBs at a Crossroads issue. It was updated after the print edition went to press to reflect the New England Patriots' Oct. 30 trade of Jimmy Garoppolo to the San Francisco 49ers. Subscribe today!\n\nIt happened all at once, the way it happens to boxers. He had been baited into throwing a pass to the wrong man, and suddenly he stood exposed, with not only the play but nature itself turning against him. His teammates seemed to have disappeared; he was the last man in position to stop the wrong man from running all the way down the field and turning the game into a rout. He tried his best, as he always does, but he was alone against a younger, faster opponent, and when he dove, he missed by a foot rather than by an inch and appeared simply to fall down, in pieces. Even those who root against him might then have pitied him, because it was one of those moments when the essence of sport is revealed to be cruelly and coldly biological: Tom Brady, in the course of throwing a pick-six to Robert Alford of the Falcons in the second quarter of Super Bowl LI, had grown old.\n\nLater, in the fourth quarter, Brady threw another pass over the middle to Alford. It was worse than the pick-six. Brady wasn't tricked; he was forcing the ball into traffic with the game on the line. This time, though, Alford didn't catch it. This time the ball caromed off his fingertips, still in play. It went up, came down, and Brady's intended receiver, Julian Edelman, leaped for it. He grabbed at it, but then so did gravity, and the ball fell toward the ground. But it didn't land on the ground. It landed on a trivet of Alford's splayed legs and Ricardo Allen's outstretched arms, and Edelman got his hands under it, in one of those moments when the essence of sport is revealed to be cosmic. By the measure of a vibrating inch, Tom Brady had overturned the verdict of time.\n\nThe oldest story in sports is not an athlete dying young. The oldest story in sports is an athlete getting old and playing past his prime, somehow hoping to avoid the inevitable. In September, Tom Brady released a book titled The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Peak Performance, in which he attempts to rewrite the oldest story in sports. It is a brief against the inevitable, irresistible not because it supplies its readers with their own blueprint for beating the clock or because it provides access to the teachings of Brady's fitness adviser and business partner Alex Guerrero, but rather because Brady is living his method, and we don't know how his story ends.\n\nOf course, we know how he wants it to end. In an interview with ESPN the day after the Patriots played the Falcons in a mid-October Super Bowl rematch, he says, \"I want to play for a long time,\" as if he were at the start of his career rather than near the end. Indeed, the 18-year veteran said this year that he wants to play until he's 45. He wants to win a couple of more Super Bowls so his already unprecedented career is impossible to replicate. But his on-the-field ambitions might be a mere prelude to what he wants to achieve off the field, because The TB12 Method captures a man attempting to transform himself from a transcendent figure in sports to a transcendent figure in the culture.\n\nBrady declares that he is \"on a mission\" and wants to \"inspire a movement.\" That his movement is about something he calls \"pliability\" -- muscles trained to become \"long, soft and primed\" instead of \"short, dense and stiff\" -- is less telling than the moral case he makes for it. \"Pliability is not just for elite athletes,\" he writes. \"It's for anyone who wants to live a vital life for as long as possible.\" The Method is not of the locker room. Instead, it reflects the values of a global elite for which human longevity is human destiny, and of which Brady and his wife, Gisele Bundchen, are members in good standing.\n\nThere is just one catch to all this: To transcend football, Brady has to keep playing it. He has made himself a test case -- the test case -- for the ideas that form the foundation of TB12, his brand. \"If you want proof that pliability and the TB12 Method works, I'm it,\" he writes. He doesn't just want to play until he's 45; he has to play until he's 45, or else he's not Tom Brady, architect of the impossible. Up against aging, injury and, possibly, the inscrutable long-range plans of his future Hall of Fame coach, Bill Belichick, Brady is playing a dangerous game within a dangerous game, and before he transcends football, he has to manage a feat almost as rare and unlikely: He has to survive it, with his body, his brain and his dignity intact.\n\nOn the Week 7 night when the Patriots and Falcons meet, New England enters the game at 4-2, in a 2017 season distinguished by its rate of attrition across the NFL, with elite player after elite player finding talent no protection from injury. Brady himself has acknowledged how often he's been hit as the season has worn on; he is said to be playing with an aching left shoulder, and when, early in the game, he moves out of the pocket and throws deep to a receiver, the pass finds its fluttering way, once again, into the hands of Robert Alford.\n\nBut then Brady gets a reprieve. As he let go of the ill-fated ball, he was hit hard and high, and, in the context of the 2017 season, yet again, by the Falcons' Adrian Clayborn. Clayborn is called for roughing the passer. Two plays later, Brady proves what every coach in the NFL already knows -- that he is a man who makes the most of second chances -- and tosses a touchdown pass to Brandin Cooks. The rout is on, with a pass thrown to Alford once again emblematic of the smiling face of fortune in Brady's career, except for this: He won a reprieve from an errant throw.\n\nHe did not win a reprieve from another hard shot to his head.\n\nTake a look at him, at the Boston convention center, back in June. He is sharing a stage with two friends, Edelman and Tony Robbins, at one of Robbins' motivational extravaganzas. It is four months after Brady's fifth Super Bowl win, a day after the conclusion of the Patriots' minicamp, and he looks as relaxed as it is possible for him to look, his crisp denim shirt open over his clean white tee. When Robbins, smiling toothily in his headset, leads the crowd in rhythmic clapping, Brady gamely claps along. He is wearing his own headset, smiling his own toothy smile, and he appears for all the world to be an aging athlete doing what aging athletes have always done -- trying to find a way off the field by turning himself into a salesman.\n\nNow take another look, keeping something very important in mind. He is Tom Freaking Brady, and so he is no more a standard-issue jock-turned-pitchman than he is a standard-issue NFL quarterback. Sure, he has something to sell, The TB12 Method and all its associated paraphernalia, from a $250 resistance band kit to a $200 cookbook. But he is not just hawking his wares; he is trying to start a movement. And so Robbins and Edelman are on hand not simply as friends, or even as comrades in arms. Robbins is a mentor, a glimpse of what Brady wants to become. Edelman is a disciple, an initiate into the mysteries of the TB12 Method. And the three men, seated onstage and rhythmically clapping, represent a tableau of belief, even when Robbins asks Brady about the minicamp.\n\n\"I walked off the field at practice and thought, 'I am the worst quarterback in the NFL,'\" Brady says. \"'How could I have possibly made those throws? How could I be so dumb to do that?'\" He smiles impeccably. \"If it's not perfect for me, I lose sleep.\"\n\nIt is hard to believe him when he talks like this. But he makes it hard to disbelieve him, because there is no way to explain his career without resorting to the inexplicable, and because he so clearly believes the unbelievable to the bottom of his soul. No matter what he happens to say, he means every word. He tells Robbins' audience the story of how he came to the Patriots as the 199th player in the 2000 NFL draft, with no one but him believing he had a chance to replace Drew Bledsoe as the starting quarterback. It is not just a story he has told many times before; it is the only story he has ever told, yet the audience is rapt because the people know there's a miracle at the end.\n\nSo take one more look at him as he tells of how his belief in himself was tested by struggle and then hardened into an implacable will, and of how that will now finds its perfect expression in the creation of the TB12 Method. It is one month after Bundchen told the world her husband has a history of undiagnosed concussions, including one he suffered last season. When Robbins asks Brady why he created TB12, he answers that he has been motivated by watching his idols fall. \"Joe Montana had to retire because his body didn't hold up,\" he says. \"Steve Young had to retire because he kept getting head injuries.\" Brady seems to imply that he can somehow avoid their fates by rigorous practice of the TB12 Method. And now in his book, he states outright that the responsibility for injury rests in part with the injured. \"When athletes get injured, they shouldn't blame their sport -- or their age,\" he writes. \"Injuries happen when our bodies are unable to absorb or disperse the amount of force placed on them.\"\n\nHe is challenging himself to accomplish feats unprecedented and miracles untold, and he is defending the game of football with the determination of a man defending his own legacy. His message is unmistakable: Football helps those who help themselves.\n\n\"There's always this baseline balance for me to find before every game,\" Brady says in the interview after the Falcons game. \"Really, our goal with the book that I wrote was to describe all of those things. ... I've been doing it for so long it's not hard for me to understand. It's very simple, and it's probably more frustrating that more people don't just understand it.\"\n\nThe TB12 Method is Brady's first real book, but there is little surprise in the fact that it doesn't take the form of a memoir, an autobiography or a tell-all -- that it isn't even really about Brady. Never in the business of self-revelation, he reveals nothing in his book except that he is very much in the business of Tom Brady. Still, The TB12 Method is an exercise in unintentional self-disclosure.\n\nThe man who gazes at us from the book's cover is a fair-skinned Californian, who after spending the better part of his life in the elements has somehow acquired nary a line or wrinkle, not a scar nor even, for that matter, a freckle. It is not so much that he looks young as that he refuses to look old. When his wife mentioned his concussions, she did so once and never again, and Brady has batted away questions about long-term neurological effects as \"none of your business.\" The word \"concussion\" never appears in The TB12 Method. The phrase \"brain injuries\" does, but only when Brady is talking about techniques to \"get ahead and stay ahead\" of them, \"especially in the off season.\" He answers questions about concussions by saying that his body is none of your business even as he begins to build a business around his body.\n\nIt has become customary to think of Brady as an athlete without limits, one who overturns expectation by refusing to concede an inch to anyone else's idea of the inevitable. But The TB12 Method offers a portrait of a ferociously limited human being, albeit the world's \"most hydrated\" one. Every day, he wakes up at 6 in the morning and immediately drinks 20 ounces of purified water, augmented with TB12 electrolytes, which, as he tells us, contain the \"72 trace minerals\" generally lost in perspiration. As a result, he says, he is so well-hydrated that \"even with adequate exposure to the sun, I won't get sunburned,\" and he presumes that the muscles under his skin look like \"beautiful tenderloins\" instead of \"shriveled jerky.\" He trains about four hours a day, and on most days, he \"does pliability\" with Guerrero, who, with hands capable of generating \"50 newtons of force in a single finger\" -- about 11 pounds -- applies \"targeted pressure\" to Brady's muscles. \"On the rare occasions when I don't have the benefit of working with Alex,\" he either does \"partner-pliability\" or goes solo with a jar of coconut oil he applies himself and a TB12 \"vibrating sphere.\" He eats abstemiously, with few portion sizes bigger than the palm of his hand, but also with a purpose, to maintain the \"alkalinity\" of his body. And he sleeps in the same determinedly therapeutic fashion, repairing to bed at 9 each night in a room uncontaminated by either technology or pet dander. He keeps a glass of water by his bedside and sleeps, famously, in TB12 \"bioceramic recovery wear,\" which is also for sale from TB12 and which Brady also considers part of a \"movement\" -- the \"tech-enabled apparel and sleepwear\" movement.\n\nLast year, he writes, he was so pleased with how he was throwing at a workout that \"I remember thinking, 'My ability to sustain my peak performance over the past 10 years is almost unbelievable to me.'\" With his \"oxygen-rich blood\" and his muscles \"firing at 100 percent,\" he can now afford to say \"I rarely get fatigued, I never get headaches and I never cramp.\" He all but pronounces himself invulnerable. He is not one of them, the irreparably damaged players we've come to pity even as we root them on. \"I can recover from Sunday's game significantly faster than players who may be 10 or 15 years younger than me,\" he writes. But the stakes are even larger -- and the odds even longer -- than that, because Brady seems to be asking his readers to acknowledge not simply that he can recover but that he is unscathed, as if he were not playing in Sunday's games at all. \"In fact, two years ago, I took a hit on my knee during a practice, requiring an MRI. The doctors who read the MRI joked afterward that my knee looked so healthy, they seriously doubted I played professional football.\"\n\nBrady writes, \"sustained peak performance isn't about luck\" and claims that \"much of the success I've been lucky enough to have in my career I owe to a lifelong 'will-over-skill' mindset.\" However, if Alford had caught the ball Brady threw to him instead of Edelman, or if the ball had followed its natural course and fallen to the turf instead of being held up by a thicket of arms and legs -- or if Pete Carroll had just handed the ball to Marshawn Lynch in Super Bowl XLIX -- we might be having an entirely different conversation about Tom Brady. He wouldn't be an immortal, and instead of talking about the efficacy of the TB12 Method in prolonging prime performance, we'd be shaking our heads about another NFL great reduced to chasing his own ghost. Brady didn't only get good against Seattle and Atlanta, he also got lucky.\n\nLuck has not always gone his way. David Tyree ended Brady's dream of an undefeated 2007 season when he caught Eli Manning's desperate heave against his helmet, a catch at least as improbable as Edelman's. And at the start of 2008, Brady tore two ligaments in his left knee, an injury so severe there were doubts about his ability to recover. When he suffered complications from surgery, he hired Guerrero, with whom he had worked in the past, to find a better way. Now Brady credits Guerrero's \"genius.\" He hugs him when he sees him and calls him \"Alejandro.\" He overlooked issues in Guerrero's past -- Guerrero paid a judgment to the Federal Trade Commission to settle charges that he claimed dietary supplements could help cure cancer -- and went into business with him. He also brought teammates into his TB12 fold, mostly converting a circle of players that includes Danny Amendola, Dont'a Hightower, Rob Gronkowski and, of course, Edelman.\n\nTo what extent does Brady now think he controls his fate? \"The moment another player's helmet makes contact with my body, my muscles are pliable enough to absorb what's happening instantly,\" he writes. \"My brain is thinking only lengthen and soften and disperse before my body absorbs and disperses the impact evenly and I hit the ground.\" Or, more simply, as he puts it in the interview, \"I know my focus on pliability has helped me avoid so many injuries and bounce back so quickly from hits.\"\n\nYet he remains an NFL player, and for any NFL player, the cruel whims of the game are not restricted to what happens on the field, especially when he's a New England Patriot and plays for a man with a formidable method of his own.\n\nBill Belichick is the coldest decision maker the game has ever known. He is a virtuoso strategist, but the essence of the Belichick Method is not only about plays but also about personnel, and knowing the earliest possible moment to let go of players who make the mistake of thinking they're indispensable. For the better part of two decades, Brady has stood as the exemplar of the Belichick Method, the coldest quarterback for the coldest coach. But he has also stood as its test, a question that one day Belichick would have to answer, the ultimate inevitability of his and Brady's careers.\n\nBelichick appeared to have come up with his answer in 2014, when, in Brady's own words, \"the youth had worn off\" and the quarterback was still trying to adjust his game after five years of postseason struggle. Smart defensive coaches had started challenging him, clogging the middle of the field in order to force him to throw outside. In 2013, Brady's yards per attempt had fallen to 6.92, his lowest since 2006, and he completed only 17 of 68 throws beyond 20 yards. \"We gotta be able to throw downfield,\" Belichick said, according to people on his staff, and though Brady, working with Guerrero, was already starting to talk about playing into his 40s -- prompting eye rolls from some Patriots staffers -- that wasn't the question that consumed New England personnel evaluators. The question was whether his skills were in irrevocable decline, and in the 2014 draft, Belichick seemed to come up with an answer by drafting Jimmy Garoppolo in the second round, the first signal that he was personally invested in a future that did not include Tom Brady and that the Belichick Method would never give way to mere sentiment.\n\nThe Chiefs drubbed the Patriots on Monday night early in the 2014 season, and Brady played so poorly -- so creakily -- that talk turned to whether he was, at long last, finished. A few days later, Belichick asked running backs coach Ivan Fears to speak to the team. Fears spoke about the importance of attitude, then turned to Brady and, with the entire team looking on, said, \"Your body language reeks of fear.\"\n\nIn response, Brady did what Brady does: He willed himself to get better. He says he \"doesn't remember\" Fears saying that to him, but he will always remember the necessity, at that moment, for mental toughness. \"It's an attitude adjustment,\" he says. \"Not ever being satisfied. Things obviously have not been easy for me in my career.\"\n\nWhat ensued over the next three seasons was arguably the greatest sustained performance by an aging athlete in the eternal history of athletes growing old -- a performance so consummate that it convinced Brady that, thanks to the TB12 Method, he wasn't really aging at all. Brady credited Guerrero for keeping his body intact, and Guerrero credited himself, but the Patriots credited adjustments Brady had made to his game. He wasn't too proud to throw the ball into the dirt at the first sign of danger, and he wasn't getting hit as much. And when the team saw how fresh his arm was at the end of a 2016 season that began with his serving a four-game suspension, talk among the coaches turned to the question that will follow Brady as long as he plays: Can he do 16 games again?\n\nBelichick is seeking to secure an immortality of his own. No one knows how much longer he'll coach, but his friends give him two or three more years, enough to ensure that his two sons, Stephen and Brian, both Patriots assistants, are secure, and possibly long enough to establish a truly dynastic succession. He'd told friends for the past year that he wanted to coach Garoppolo as a starter and that he was confident he could win a Super Bowl with him. That, of course, would have required him to decouple himself from the player who has changed his life and his legacy, and so the question always was: Would he do it? Would he actually move on from TB12?\n\nOn the night of Oct. 30, that question was answered -- for now, at least -- when he traded Garoppolo to the San Francisco 49ers for a second-round pick. The trade came out of nowhere, surprising people close to Belichick, Brady and Garoppolo. But while it's easy to see the move as a demonstration that Brady is and always will be the one exception to the Belichick Method, it instead serves as confirmation that the Method will always win. Did Belichick trade his backup out of loyalty to a 40-year-old quarterback, or because cutting bait at exactly the right time is what he always does and always will do?\n\nFor the short term, Brady will find himself in the position of being the future of the Patriots -- with no end in sight. The Garoppolo trade can be seen as an expression of faith not only in Brady, but also in the TB12 Method. The apparent vote of confidence comes even as Brady has found himself in the middle of a conflict between the Patriots and Guerrero, with Guerrero blaming the team's trainers for injuries some of his clients have suffered and with Belichick making it resoundingly clear that Guerrero has no actual role on his staff. \"There's a collision coming,\" a friend of Belichick's says, and even without Garoppolo itching to supplant him, Brady is aware of the competing legacies at the heart of the Patriots' historic success. He says now that he \"hopes\" he doesn't play for anyone else, but \"I'm also not naive to think I can't.\"\n\nAnd Brady is not the only one to have written a book. At the end of his 2005 collaboration with David Halberstam, The Education of a Coach, Belichick makes a case for luck as a prerequisite for greatness and uses Brady as the prime example. When Brady was suspended at the beginning of 2016, Garoppolo took his place, in an echo of the start of Brady's career. But there is only one Brady. Garoppolo played well, but for either a want of luck or willpower he lasted only five and a half quarters before being knocked out with a shoulder injury and eventually giving way to Tom Brady and the Method.\n\nOne day last year, the two scientists whose company created the software product Brain HQ were surprised by a phone call that came to their office in San Francisco. It was Alex Guerrero, telling them Tom Brady was using the brain exercises they'd been developing, and they were surprised for a couple of reasons. First, Brady wanted to meet them. And second, he was not using the exercises in ways for which they were intended. \"We improve people who need improvement,\" says Henry Mahncke, CEO of Posit Science. \"Old people, people who've suffered cognitive damage, but not a guy at the top of his game using our exercises to get better.\"\n\nSo Mahncke and Posit Science founder Michael Merzernich flew to Boston and visited Brady and Guerrero at the TB12 training center. \"The first thing that was pretty wild was that they had a personal team of neuroscientists,\" Mahncke says. \"And we're like, 'This is the kind of thing you can do when you're the greatest quarterback of all time.' But what he told us was pretty striking. He said, 'I'm at the point where I want to be the best in every possible way. I came across the exercises in Popular Science, and I can already see the difference in my brain function. This kind of brain training is like physical conditioning. It can help anyone.'\n\n\"That's just not how we thought of brain training before,\" Mahncke says. \"If you have bad cognitive function, we can help you. But Tom was using the same exercises that people in much worse condition use. We didn't have to change the science at all. He was just using them at a totally different level.\"\n\nDid Brady decide to engage in brain training because he felt himself on the verge of rising to a new level or because he felt himself falling behind as a consequence of trauma already suffered? Mahncke didn't know; he had never asked. But he wanted to make one thing clear: \"I talk to Tom a bunch, and this might surprise you, but he never talks about concussions, at all.\"\n\n\u0093If you want proof that pliability and the TB12 Method works, I'm it.\u0094\n\n- Tom Brady, in his book, \"The TB12 Method\"\n\nBut the question holds, because either Tom Brady is a football player who, like other football players, has suffered multiple concussions, or he is a football player who, unlike most other football players, has found a way to rise above the game's inherent assault on body and brain. It is not only his wife who says he is the former; many Broncos believe they noticed him in an all-too-recognizable daze during the 2015 AFC championship game. Yet he not only speaks in his book of his determination to stay ahead of brain injuries; he speaks unsparingly of those who let injuries get ahead of them. Famous for being unforgiving of himself when he makes mistakes, he turns out to be unforgiving of players who make the mistake of getting injured. \"If our bodies can handle the force, it doesn't matter what sport we play or how old we are. That's why age isn't my problem!\"\n\nHe has little sympathy for anyone whose experience might contradict the overarching TB12 narrative. \"Players say the biggest reason [for early retirement] is their fear of the long-term effects of playing while injured. I don't have that fear. They have no idea they can have a body or a career free of the pain that athletes of the past have endured.\"\n\nBy the end of The TB12 Method, he is not even talking about injuries, trauma or even sport. He is professing his faith that \"we can decelerate the aging process as most people experience it today.\" As an athlete, he is already an immortal, but he begins to emerge as an Immortalist too, someone convinced that the answer to the question he poses near the close of the book -- \"What does it mean to naturally age?\" -- is that aging is unnatural and not to be accepted without a fight. It sounds grandiose. But after the Falcons rematch, he puts the fight in a humble context:\n\n\"The reality for me is not how long I want to live but the quality of life. I love playing football, I love everything about it, I want to do it for a long time. And at the end of that, I still want to do all the things I love to do. And that's what it's about for me. It's about doing what I love to do for as long as I'm here. You can't take any of these days for granted. But I also want to do what I have to do to prevent long-term damage to my body playing sports. Afterward, I still want to be able to ski, to surf, and do the things I love to do. I still want to be able to throw the ball around with my kids and play soccer in the backyard and have fun in life.\"\n\nIt's not that Brady wants what no one else has. He wants what everyone else has, or thinks they have. He toys with the notion of immortality because, as a human being who has played nearly 300 games in the NFL, his mortality is demonstrably accelerated and actuarially advanced. To do a job for as long as he loves and to stay whole, it doesn't seem like much to ask. But then again it is asking for the world.\n\nOf course, Belichick and the Patriots are also asking the world of Brady. They are not only committing to a 40-year-old quarterback; they, with the Garoppolo trade, have blocked Brady's simplest means of a graceful exit. He has decided not to stop. Now he also can't fail.\n\nWhat would count as a failure for Tom Brady? Playing until he's 41 instead of playing until he's 45? Never winning another Super Bowl? Getting released at age 43 from the Patriots and spending the last days of his career hobbling around for the Browns, still angry that they took Spergon Wynn in the sixth round of the 2000 draft instead of him? Or getting all he wants -- playing until he's 45 and winning two more Super Bowls -- only to discover 15 years later that he has recurring headaches and his memory is hazy and he can't follow the route to the nearest TB12 training center?\n\nNone of these scenarios is far-fetched and none of these scenarios is inevitable, and the scenario that probably scares him the most -- the one in which, for all his investment in brain training and bioceramic sleepwear, he ends up just another athlete staying on a little too long and getting out a little too late -- is the most likely. He is so accustomed to thinking in terms of the impossible that he often forgets to think in terms of the probable, and he's so intent on thinking in terms of willpower that he misses the simple power inherent in accepting one's fate. People do run out of luck, especially on the football field. And with the Method, he defines unavoidable occurrences in his sport as failures and risks making failures of his teammates and his friends.\n\nSo let's go back to Tom Brady throwing a pass to Julian Edelman. This time they're not playing for high stakes in the Super Bowl; this time they're playing for no stakes at all, in a preseason game against Detroit. Edelman lines up in his familiar place in the slot; he dances upfield, then catches a ball Brady throws over the middle. It's an ageless play run by two men who have made ageless plays their business. Then three Lions close in. Edelman tries to do the impossible -- he tries to evade them all -- and when he pivots left, his right knee gives out, extending so unnaturally that it snaps him into the air with the force of a slingshot. He falls to the ground and rolls over clutching his knee, in an agony of ruin, knowing his season is over.\n\nMore From Doubletruck\n\nDoubletruck is the home for ESPN storytelling, a place to find great features, investigations and character portraits. Doubletruck home \u00bb\n\nBy Brady's logic, the injury could not have been a matter of luck -- there is no luck. It could not have been the game -- don't blame the game. It has to be a failure of pliability. \"What will happen when an athlete with tight, dense, stiff muscles ... runs and makes a sharp cut?\" he writes. \"If these functions overload a muscle, bone, tendon or ligament, he will get injured.\" But here's the problem: Edelman practices pliability. He \"certainly gets some deep-force muscle work,\" Brady says. How then can Edelman have failed?\n\nBut then something else happens. Over the course of the season, even as Brady maintains an MVP-level form, others go down -- all members of the pliability circle. Hightower with a knee issue and a pectoral tear. Amendola with a concussion. Gronk with a groin problem. Brady himself has an aching shoulder. But he not only keeps showing up, he keeps prevailing, left alone with his Method, his singular talent and his unflagging determination. The game might never beat TB12. But it will do its best to make him the last man standing.\n\nTom JunodBefore joining ESPN as a senior writer, Junod wrote for Esquire and GQ.

    "raw_text": "On the eve of his final NFL draft as Baltimore Ravens general manager, Ozzie Newsome did something that would shock anyone who knows him. The reserved Newsome opened up about his journey.\n\nWhile the trappings that Newsome\u2019s success affords him now would be unrecognizable to the boy who worked cotton fields for extra money, he can\u2019t help but notice that, in some ways, America is unchanged.\n\n\u201cI was one of a few that integrated the school in my hometown,\u201d said Newsome, who will retire as GM after next season, \u201cbut 50 years later I can go to events and still be the only black person there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a dispiriting reality. Yet Newsome\u2019s optimistic disposition remains undefeated.\n\nOzzie Newsome Jr. was born in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, in 1956 during the Montgomery Bus Boycott sparked by the arrest of Rosa Parks. He was 7 years old when four little girls were murdered in the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, part of a string of racial violence that earned the city the nickname \u201cBombingham.\u201d The violent attacks on peaceful marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma took place nine days before his ninth birthday.\n\nIn this highly charged climate, a young Newsome told his parents that he wanted to be bused to the predominantly white elementary school.\n\n\u201cI knew I was going to have to compete with them academically and athletically eventually,\u201d Newsome said, \u201cso I wanted to start.\u201d\n\nOn his first day, as one of three black kids in class, Newsome said he felt no fears or nervousness. You could draw a line from that morning at Leighton Elementary School in northwest Alabama to his groundbreaking career in football. You could say the clarity he showed as a 12-year-old boy is part of what has made him one of the greatest general managers in NFL history.\n\nThe story is biopic fodder that anyone would want to watch. Everyone except the man himself. Suggest he was brave and he bristles: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the first time I was around white people.\u201d Newsome pushed back anytime he was cast as exceptionally noble, brave or wise during the interview.\n\nAnd he shut down any questions that might have led to him being viewed sympathetically. Asked whether he experienced mistreatment in the nearly all-white environment, Newsome said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t fight every day,\u201d after trying to move off the topic. \u201cI had to learn to bite my tongue,\u201d he said, unwilling to discuss specifics.\n\n\u201cMy parents had it much worse than I did. I was seeing progress,\u201d Newsome said.\n\nHe was right, and in some cases he was the progress. Newsome and his brother were the only two black players on their Little League All-Star Team. Newsome remembers a regional tournament in Georgia when the team stayed at a camp near a lake. He recalls walking around the grounds and seeing many white families.\n\n\u201cAfter just one night, we switched to a different hotel,\u201d Newsome said.\n\nThe first hotel\u2019s management told Newsome\u2019s coaches that Newsome and his brother were forbidden from staying on the grounds because guests had been complaining about their presence. The white coach moved the team to a different hotel without explanation. It wasn\u2019t until adulthood that the coach told Newsome that the team moved because guests were made uncomfortable by his blackness. \u201cParents and coaches shielded us from that stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the coach who had the most influence on Newsome was the University of Alabama\u2019s Paul \u201cBear\u201d Bryant. Newsome credits Bryant with teaching him to work to improve every day as a player, but more importantly as a man, for the sake of the people around him. Bryant was revered by Alabamians, so the impact of his teachings on his players was great. For Newsome, it seemed that even before that message had been offered, he had decided he wanted to receive it.\n\nA high school All-American receiver, Newsome had narrowed his choices to Auburn or Alabama. The passing connection of Auburn quarterback Pat Sullivan to receiver Terry Beasley was college football\u2019s most impressive. After both players were chosen near the top of the NFL draft, Auburn looked to replace them. Newsome\u2019s high school quarterback, a year older than Newsome, chose Auburn. Newsome was intrigued by the reunion and the potential of the duo becoming the new Sullivan to Beasley. But he came to see the decision as a choice between personal glory and team success. So he chose Alabama looking to win championships.\n\nHe made an instant impact at Alabama, becoming the team\u2019s leading receiver as a freshman in 1974. They won all 11 regular-season games but lost in the Orange Bowl to Notre Dame, falling short of the national championship. For the next three seasons, Newsome didn\u2019t miss a game, and his production increased. By the end of his senior season, he owned all the meaningful receiving records and earned All-American honors. In Newsome\u2019s four seasons at Alabama, the Crimson Tide ended all but one season ranked in the top five, but never No. 1. Newsome left school without the ultimate team success he sought.\n\nRavens head coach John Harbaugh believes that Newsome\u2019s football philosophy is based on principles given to him by Bryant. Newsome said Bryant taught him much more. \u201cHe gave me the principles that shaped the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nIn 1978, the Cleveland Browns selected Newsome with the 23rd pick of the NFL draft. Newsome was named Offensive Player of the Year for the Browns as a rookie despite changing positions to tight end. He cites Calvin Hill\u2019s mentorship as the reason he adapted quickly to life in the NFL. Hill, the Yale-educated running back, was winding down his career in Cleveland just as Newsome arrived. Despite the 10-year gap in their ages, Newsome and Hill developed a bond that remains strong to this day. \u201cWe still talk a few times a week,\u201d Newsome said.\n\nHill, who grew up in Baltimore, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk much about the Ravens. We talk about family and college basketball, when Duke and the University of North Carolina play.\u201d Oddly, they find themselves on opposite sides of college basketball\u2019s most storied rivalry. Hill\u2019s allegiance has been with Duke since his son, Grant, became a Blue Devils basketball star in the early 1990s. Newsome became partial to the Tar Heels after he had gotten to know former UNC head coach Dean Smith, who was a friend of Bear Bryant\u2019s.\n\nHill said as a rookie, Newsome was \u201cmature and a learner, which aided in his transition to the pros.\u201d But Hill believes his influence on Newsome was more social than professional.\n\n\u201cHe was raw, like I was as a rookie,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI talked to him about managing his money. I took him to the art museum, but I don\u2019t think he liked that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was bored stiff,\u201d Newsome said about that trip.\n\nWhile recounting Newsome\u2019s interaction with a French-speaking waiter, Hill laughed. \u201cThe waiter asked us what we were going to have, and Ozzie asked him to repeat himself \u2014 not because he didn\u2019t understand but because he liked the way it sounded.\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s favorite memory of that first year with Newsome has to do with the rookie\u2019s brand new Lincoln Continental.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work. He would drive us to practice and stay only in the right lane of the interstate because every 10 miles it would cut off,\u201d Hill said.\n\nDespite the unreliable vehicle, they were never late. Newsome was persistent and unflappable. Hill would joke with Newsome in the huddle, asking, \u201cDo you ever sweat?\u201d Almost nothing shook Newsome\u2019s focused demeanor. Hill said there was only one time that he saw Newsome appear disturbed. \u201cHe introduced me to [his then-girlfriend] Gloria, now his wife. I hugged her. I guess that wasn\u2019t what they did in Alabama. He looked like he wanted to kill me.\u201d\n\nMaybe Newsome\u2019s small-town Southern ways didn\u2019t fit perfectly in a big city, but his play sure did. Newsome\u2019s professional career was a lot like his collegiate career. He quickly became one of the best players in the NFL, but he never won a Super Bowl. Newsome\u2019s Browns lost in the AFC Championship Game three times.\n\nAfter 13 seasons as the Browns\u2019 tight end, Newsome worked as a coach and in player personnel for the team. Eventually, he committed himself fully to the personnel office. The team\u2019s all-time leader in receiving yards toiled alongside younger, less accomplished staff members. A former player choosing the personnel path over coaching would have been surprising to everyone except the people at East Ohio Gas. Newsome worked in the gas company\u2019s personnel department during the final few offseasons of his career.\n\n\u201cI was an on-campus recruiter,\u201d Newsome said of his duties with the gas company. \u201cIt was a little bit like scouting in the NFL: You go to a college campus, you set up your interviews, you have 30 minutes to make a determination.\u201d\n\nNewsome rose fast once he transitioned from player to scout. By 1995, just his fifth season in the front office, he had become the Browns\u2019 director of pro personnel under head coach Bill Belichick. The \u201995 season would be Newsome\u2019s last in Cleveland. Team owner Art Modell\u2019s relationship with the city had deteriorated to the point of irreconcilability. Modell cut ties, and after a 5-11 season, he fired Belichick. Cleveland\u2019s beloved franchise was moving to Baltimore, and Newsome was going too. Without an official general manager, Newsome took control of the player personnel side as vice president of player personnel. Under the chaos of building a brand-new franchise from inside of a former police barracks in a Baltimore suburb, Newsome prepared for his first NFL draft as the man with complete control of all player personnel decisions.\n\nWith two first-round picks, Newsome selected offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden, Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2013, and linebacker Ray Lewis, Hall of Fame Class of 2018. That\u2019s a pretty good way to start a franchise.\n\nIn 1997 and \u201998, Newsome made two acquisitions that, though less heralded, were no less significant: He brought on James \u201cShack\u201d Harris and John Wooten. Harris joined first, as director of pro personnel, almost 30 years after he became the first black regular starter at quarterback in NFL history. The Ravens added Wooten the following season as assistant director of pro personnel. Wooten, drafted by the Browns in 1959, blocked for Jim Brown on the field and defended Muhammad Ali off the field. Wooten helped to organize the historic 1967 Cleveland Summit, the iconic meeting of prominent black athletes in support of Ali. Both Harris and Wooten were among the first black people to work in NFL personnel after their playing careers.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about the success of early Baltimore Ravens and that first Super Bowl that we won,\u201d Newsome said, \u201cShaq and Woot had a lot to do with that.\u201d\n\nThis unprecedented front office was compiling talent, but the team had just 16 wins in three seasons. So in 1999, head coach Ted Marchibroda was fired and Newsome was tasked with finding the replacement. That was the same year Newsome became a Pro Football Hall of Famer, the personal accomplishment that brings him the most joy. He sees being immortalized in Canton, Ohio, as validation of efforts made by family, mentors and teammates. \u201cI am in the Hall because of sacrifices made for me, starting with my mother working all day and still getting me to practice as a kid.\u201d\n\nNewsome named then-Vikings offensive coordinator Brian Billick as Ravens head coach. In his second season, Billick delivered a Super Bowl championship to Baltimore. Billick remembers seeing Newsome standing on the sideline, grinning as the game clock counted down to the moment when Newsome could celebrate the realization of his decades-long quest for team success.\n\nNewsome was named general manager of the Ravens in November 2002, 21 months after the team he had built won the Super Bowl. The title would have merely been formality \u2014 Newsome had been the de facto GM since \u201996 \u2014 if not for the fact that it cemented Newsome\u2019s place in NFL history. He became the first black general manager in the history of the league. That distinction didn\u2019t fully sink in for Newsome until he was told by racial pioneer and former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson Jr. that now others could and would follow in his footsteps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like everything,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe first is not evaluated on just their ability; there is added pressure. Whether Ozzie wanted it or not, he took on a responsibility.\u201d\n\nA responsibility to alter perceptions and weaken centuries-old stereotypes, granting black men slightly better access to opportunities that were previously denied.\n\nSeven teams had black GMs by the end of the 2016 season. But the league is down to just three today: Reggie McKenzie (Oakland Raiders), Chris Grier (Miami Dolphins) and Newsome. For a league with 70 percent black players, representation among GMs needs to increase. But unless some of next offseason\u2019s openings are filled by black candidates, the league will drop to 6 percent black general managers.\n\nWhen confronted with these stats, Newsome wonders, \u201cDid I do enough?\u201d He is often reminded of the impact his representation has on players and fans.\n\n\u201cWhen I go to the barbershop, they know I\u2019m the GM of the Baltimore Ravens,\u201d Newsome said, \u201cand those people may never buy a ticket, but they are Baltimore Ravens fans.\u201d\n\nFor the past couple of months, Newsome has been welcoming draft prospects into his office. \u201cThey are amazed to see me sitting in the big chair.\u201d\n\nRemembering a specific player, Newsome had to chuckle. \u201cI was interviewing a kid yesterday and he said, \u2018Take me through your history.\u2019 I\u2019ve been at this longer than some of these kids have been alive.\u201d\n\nHe told the player that he started with the Ravens 22 years ago. The player responded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just 20.\u201d Even with the age gap, there is a familiarity. \u201cWhen people see people of their color in positions like this, there\u2019s a warmness,\u201d Newsome said.\n\nAfter moving on from Billick in 2008, Newsome tapped Eagles special teams coordinator John Harbaugh to coach the team. That choice was criticized, but again Newsome was proved right. Harbaugh brought the Ravens a second championship, defeating the Colin Kaepernick-quarterbacked San Francisco 49ers by three points in Super Bowl XLVII.\n\nKaepernick, whose place in the public consciousness long surpassed quarterback after he initiated a series of demonstrations during the national anthem, has been unable to re-enter the league. After a preseason injury to starting quarterback Joe Flacco, the Ravens toyed with the idea of signing the polarizing signal-caller but opted to sign David Olson, the former quarterback for the Kansas City Phantoms of the Champions Indoor Football league.\n\nNewsome declined to discuss the specifics of the Kaepernick situation, citing the grievance filed by Kaepernick accusing NFL teams of colluding to keep him out of the league. But he did say about Kaepernick and other outspoken players, \u201cWhen they take a political stance based on their views, I think it\u2019s OK. I think they\u2019re allowed to do that. I don\u2019t think it has impacted their play on the field.\u201d\n\nTwo minutes later, asked which athletes he admires, Newsome responded, \u201cCalvin [Hill] was an activist, so it goes right to Calvin. I have a great amount of respect for Jim Brown and the stances that he\u2019s taken. To me, it\u2019s not just one, I think it\u2019s several guys that have chosen to take their position and use it for the betterment of society.\u201d\n\nNewsome\u2019s tenure with the Ravens spans the entire history of the franchise, two owners, three head coaches and hundreds of players. Under Newsome\u2019s guidance, the Ravens have been one of the league\u2019s most consistently competitive franchises. However, the Ravens haven\u2019t had much to celebrate lately. They\u2019ve gone 40-40 since their Super Bowl victory in 2013, missing the playoffs in four of the past five seasons. Baltimore fans and media have been critical of Newsome\u2019s eye for playmaking receivers, and the team\u2019s recent offensive production hasn\u2019t done much to assuage those concerns.\n\nAccording to a recent USA Today poll of NFL agents, Newsome is the league\u2019s most respected decision-maker. But given his contributions as a player and to the progress of the league, the others on the list are not his only peers.\n\nDespite (maybe as a result of) being a product of a tumultuous period in American history, Newsome emerged as an understated man, not without imperfections he would willingly expose sooner than boast. At the end of this upcoming season, Newsome will walk away from the game. He will probably fill that void with some combination of golf and family. But as for the void he will leave in the game, nobody can fill that.",

    "summary": "Pistons coach Larry Brown didn't have a lot of interest in playing Darko because Detroit had received the No.\nLike most of Darko's coaches before him, Rivers did not see Darko playing a significant role on his team.\nThat is why, when Darko's son Lazar asks Darko about basketball, Darko is honest.\n\"When I told him, 'Don't do everything that I did if you want to be good,'\" Darko says, \"he was like, 'Why?\nWhen he was playing basketball, Darko says, he never thought he had done anything wrong.",
    "publish_date": null,
    "authors": [],
    "raw_text": "2. He no longer believes that, because of a combination of peer pressure and societal customs, he should lie about his dream.\n\nDarko was 18 when the Detroit Pistons drafted him. Before that, he lived in Serbia during the 1990s, which meant he saw his country -- and his father, who was a soldier -- fight in several wars in the Balkan region. He also lived through NATO bombings that decimated his city, forcing him and his parents and his sister to spend days on end in their basement, listening to the whooshes and thumps of explosions above.\n\nOnce, during the war in Bosnia in the early '90s, as his family watched television, there was a news report about how 15 or 20 Serbian soldiers were killed that day. One of the names the newscaster read was Milorad Milicic. Darko, who wasn't even 10 yet, remembers looking up and seeing a picture of his dad on the screen.\n\n\"Why is Daddy on the TV?\" he asked his mother.\n\nHis mother didn't answer. She just started crying. So Darko cried too.\n\nBut then about five minutes later, the newscaster said it was a mistake. Some of the names were wrong. \"I'll never forget what that felt like,\" Darko says. \"All of a sudden he was gone. All of a sudden he wasn't.\"\n\nMilorad came home. And, among other things, he taught Darko how to play basketball, showing him shooting techniques on a hoop just down the hill from the house. It wasn't because either father or son had a particular love for the game, though. It was mostly biology.\n\n\"My father taught me because there were people from the village who said, 'You're tall -- why not try?'\" Darko shrugs. \"I wasn't the one that asked to play basketball.\"\n\nStill, basketball turned out to be something he was good at. And because of family encouragement, and the same kind of teenage inertia that makes kids stick with the tuba for six years even though they're only sort of interested in music, Darko kept doing it. He moved to Hemofarm, a professional club in the city of Vrsac, when he was 14. Basketball became his purpose even if it wasn't his passion.\n\nBy the time scouts started coming around, Darko saw the NBA as a way out -- of financial insecurity, of persistent tumult, of Serbia -- more than any kind of childhood fantasy coming true. He liked the game enough. Everyone he met was rooting for him to go. It was all right there in front of him. And who hasn't walked through a door simply because it was open?\n\nThe problem is that wasn't the narrative we expect from foreign basketball players. We expect them to love the NBA, to have grown up watching it on choppy internet streams or satellite television, to cherish its players and aspire to its trappings. When Yao Ming came to the NBA from China, he made no secret of his longtime adoration of Arvydas Sabonis and Hakeem Olajuwon; more recently, Kristaps Porzingis, a Latvian, made it clear that Dirk Nowitzki was his inspiration, and everyone nodded.\n\nSo, as soon as Darko began to get some attention in the U.S., the expected questions began: \"Who was your idol? Who did you love to watch?\n\nKevin Garnett, Darko answered. He told everyone that Garnett, a tall power forward with a wingspan wider than a school bus, was his muse. He told local television stations he liked Garnett. He told USA Today he liked Garnett. He told ESPN he liked Garnett.\n\nExcept he had barely seen Garnett play. \"I just sort of found him and decided he's the one,\" Darko says now. \"It seemed like the player I was supposed to like.\"\n\nSupposed to -- that was Old Darko's existence, wasn't it? He was tall, so he played basketball. He was good, so he went to Hemofarm. He got noticed, so he went to America. He needed an idol, so he made one up. He followed the trail wherever it led. There was no hazy image of grandeur in his mind's eye, no sweet moment of make-believe lolling about in his brain. He was dreaming with the lights on.\n\nNow that basketball is over, though, it is different. Now, he does fantasize about a passion. Now, he does have a picture of something that makes him smile.\n\nCherries.\n\nSee, Darko got into commercial farming after basketball. Some athletes do real estate or clothing -- Darko did fruit. Don't be confused: His farm is more Dole Plantation than Old MacDonald. He has 125 acres filled with apple trees and exports the apples to Dubai, Russia and countries in Africa.\n\nCherries, though, are his vision. The financial return on cherries is tremendous, Darko says, and the market is wide open. When Darko talks about cherries, his eyes get wide. He gets passionate. He gets animated.\n\n\"I want to make these cherries,\" he says during the only moment we are together when he sounds wistful. \"I think it's time.\"\n\n3. His typical evening routine no longer includes damaging his own home.\n\nDarko doesn't punch walls anymore. He punches heavy bags occasionally as a way to get exercise, and he once punched a horse in the face (more on that later), but his days of regularly inflicting punishment on the walls around him are over.\n\nThis is an important change. When Darko was playing in the NBA -- well, not exactly playing -- he would often return to his apartment after stewing on the bench for yet another game and channel his rage toward the typically thin, American Sheetrock walls.\n\nThe worst was in Memphis. Darko's wife, Zorana, who was living with him then, calls that his \"crisis period.\" The team was losing. Darko was infuriated. And the walls in that apartment looked like cottage cheese, a mess of bubbly bumps and curds.\n\nThe sequence was familiar: He would come in, hammer on the walls and go to sleep. In most cities, he came to know the local contractors who could run over, throw some putty up and do a quick cover-up job with whatever paint they had handy.\n\n\"You know you have exactly white, and then the other white, and then gray?\" Darko says of his patchy walls. \"That was my house.\"\n\nDarko had always had outbursts. He called them \"going crazy.\" Mile Ilic, who met Darko when they were both teenagers, says sometimes Darko was just inexplicably petulant -- he would stop practicing or not want to do a drill or not think he should have to help clean up the gym -- and the coach would punish the rest of the team.\n\n\"At those moments, you simply start hating him because you have to suffer for it,\" Ilic says. \"It would last for five or 10 minutes and then he would be a totally normal character.\"\n\nBy the time Darko reached the NBA, however, his emotions were more complex. At first, he was just a teenager, an ocean away from home in a culture he didn't understand. For example, Darko would go home to shower after practices or games instead of staying in the locker room to clean up; he didn't realize that in America, the players all showered together.\n\n\"So I had to teach Darko,\" says Chauncey Billups, who played in Detroit from 2002-08, \"like, no, when we're done playing, when we're done practicing, you put your towel on and you go get in the shower. That's what we do here.\"\n\nIt wasn't long, though, before the na\u00efvet\u00e9 melted to anger. Pistons coach Larry Brown didn't have a lot of interest in playing Darko because Detroit had received the No. 2 pick in a trade and had a slew of skilled veterans at the time. Also, when Brown did play Darko, he wanted him to work near the rim instead of passing and shooting from the outside as Darko preferred. Darko quickly plunged into a near-perpetual pout.\n\nThere was wall punching. There was also drinking, and Darko began showing up to practice still tipsy after an overnight bender. \"I just wouldn't sleep,\" he says. It was classic high school behavior: He couldn't be the star, so he decided to be the bad-boy rebel.\n\n\"I don't have any regrets about how we treated Darko,\" Brown says now. \"I have regrets that he couldn't have been more mature and patient.\"\n\nThe same thing happened in Orlando. And with Memphis, too, where Darko was so unhappy that he went off on a rant against the referees after an international game that was immortalized on YouTube. (Darko used such graphic profanity even the reporters interviewing him tried to calm him down.) \"Everywhere I went, it was just the littlest thing that would set me off and I'd flip,\" Darko says.\n\nYou know the craziest thing? All that wall punching ... and the two times he ever broke his hand came when he was actually on the court. In Memphis, he cracked a bone in his right hand against Indiana. And in his first season, when Detroit was on the verge of winning the NBA championship over the Lakers, Brown finally put Darko in, an opponent smacked him while he was shooting a jump shot and his hand shattered.\n\n\"I was trying to show Larry Brown my hand because my hand was like shaking,\" Darko says. \"He just pushed me back in the game.\"\n\nDarko rolls his eyes when he talks about it now. He hasn't punched a wall in a while, he says, and Zorana says the same. Darko jokes that the reason is because Serbian houses are made from masonry, with textured wallpaper stuck on top of stone. The walls in Serbia don't have any give.\n\nZorana thinks removing the intensity of basketball from Darko's life was the key, like taking the lighter out of a gas grill. Now, she says, the sequence at night is: Darko comes in, has dinner with the family and watches television before (sometimes) dozing off on the couch.\n\nIt also isn't basketball that Darko watches. He actually does not follow the NBA much at all, he says, and he isn't kidding: I first meet Darko in June, just days after the Golden State Warriors took a 2-0 lead on the Cleveland Cavaliers (featuring LeBron) in the NBA Finals. Anyone with even a passing interest in the sport knows about the battles between LeBron and Stephen Curry.\n\nBut when I ask Darko about the series, he looks genuinely surprised. We are sitting at his farm, and Darko glances at the fields. \"The Finals are going on now?\" he asks. \"Who is winning?\"\n\n4. He knew when to quit.\n\nOn Nov. 17, 2012, the Celtics had a game against the Toronto Raptors. That day, as the players were filtering into the locker room, Darko knocked on Doc Rivers' office door.\n\nLike most of Darko's coaches before him, Rivers did not see Darko playing a significant role on his team. To that point, through nine games, Darko had played a total of five minutes.\n\nBut Rivers liked Darko, liked having him in practice. So he welcomed Darko into his office and listened as Darko told him he had come to say goodbye.\n\n\"In the center position, if something goes bad for the team, you have [Jason] Collins, you have [Fab] Melo,\" Darko said. \"So I'm packed and going home.\"\n\nDarko recalls Rivers being stunned. \"Darko, what are you talking about? Where are you going? You are going to play tonight.\"\n\nDarko was unbowed. \"Doc, that's it. I'm not playing tonight, I'm not playing ever again.\n\n\"Thank you guys for trying. It didn't go well. I'm out.\"\n\nWhen Darko went into the locker room to tell his teammates, several didn't seem to understand. He was leaving? Like, for good? For good, he told them. It was over.\n\nPublicly, the Celtics said Darko had asked for his release so he could return home to be with his mother, who was sick. In truth, Darko's mother had a minor illness -- and recovered just fine -- and Darko had been planning his exit for a while.\n\nHe first thought about leaving in Orlando, if he's being honest, when they didn't sign him to a contract extension. But Memphis gave him a $21 million contract because the Grizzlies thought they could fix him. Then, when that didn't work out, he nearly left again, but the Timberwolves -- even after he advised Minnesota not to trade for him -- dealt for him anyway and offered a $20 million contract, convinced that they, in fact, were the ones who could bring out the talent everyone was so sure Darko possessed. (They weren't.)\n\nFinally Boston took its shot, stepping forward like the last in a line of children taking swings at an empty pinata.\n\n\"Everybody was trying to find a way to keep me,\" Darko says. Leaving, then, even in the way he did, was the moment when he took back control.\n\nIs Darko a quitter? It seems too easy a label. In Darko's mind, Boston was simply the time when he decided to stop thinking everything was suddenly going to change. There was some measure of survival in it, too; over nine years, the water had risen to Darko's chin so many times it was easy to understand why he felt certain he was about to drown.\n\n\"I was so lost,\" Darko says. \"I really came to hate basketball, you know? I just wanted to come back home and live another life.\"\n\nZorana had packed everything, and the family flew back to Serbia the day after Darko's conversation with Rivers. For a while, he felt relief. Then, he felt itchy and idle. Then he partied. Then he toyed with playing again, almost making a comeback with a Serbian team. Then he had a much-publicized midlife crisis (which is not unreasonable at age 29 when you turn professional at age 14), during which he became a kickboxer.\n\nHe fought once. On the night of the bout, Darko stepped on the scale for the prefight weigh-in and broke it. Literally broke it.\n\n\"It took us one hour to find another scale,\" says Darko Popivoda, the promoter of the fight. \"Darko stepped on that scale, and that scale also broke.\" At that point, Popivoda just asked Darko how much he weighed. Over 300 pounds, Darko sheepishly said.\n\nThings did not improve in the ring. Darko had a strong knee but says he \"forgot\" to use it. He had a good left high kick but kicked primarily with his right. \"I mean, I want to kill him, but I don't know how,\" Darko says. His opponent, who was much smaller, did know how: He whaled on Darko until his legs were bleeding so badly he couldn't stand up.\n\nDarko's family was \"not really that happy\" with his decision to fight, he says, and one evening, when we are chatting quietly, Zorana describes it to me as \"stupidly stupid stupid.\" Her feelings (along with the ease with which Darko was dismantled) led Darko away from another kickboxing engagement and toward a quick second sports retirement. It seemed a wise decision.\n\nInstead, he became intrigued by agriculture. A few friends were farmers, and that was appealing, but the element that drew Darko was the idea that he could master it. He was supposed to be a basketball wizard; that hadn't quite worked out. Farming was another chance.\n\nDarko quickly became hooked. He traveled to Italy to look at famous orchards. He learned about soil and growing patterns and tree heights. He considered other types of fruits, then, after settling on apples, reviewed the varieties.\n\nThe juxtaposition is stark: A former basketball player doesn't know the NBA Finals is even happening, but when I ask how he monitors quality in the orchard, he walks me over to a hedge and delivers a long, winding explanation about the ideal distance each apple should be from the tree trunk. (A summary: the closer to the trunk, the better.)\n\nDarko's passion is real. When an unexpected snowfall damaged about 10 acres of apples this spring, he went out with the workers to try to salvage the crop. And last year, when he walked through the orchard during the first picking season, he experienced a sensation that, he says, was foreign to him: pride.\n\n\"I was just really happy,\" he says. \"You know, we were picking our apples. Ours.\"\n\n5. When he goes drinking now, he uses his hands (most of the time).\n\nIn April 2015, Darko and his friends were at a party. There was beer. There was singing. There was lots of shouting and laughing and men raising their arms in the air. All pretty standard.\n\nBut at one point, Darko got up near the front of the crowd and, shirtless, inserted a bottle into his mouth. He then removed his hand from the side of the bottle and tipped his head backward, as if swallowing an aspirin. He remained in that position until the bottle was empty.\n\nIt was a remarkable bit of drinking agility -- one that was immortalized in a much-watched video on the internet -- even though much of the beer ended up on his neck and face and shoulders. Darko then grabbed another beer bottle but, instead of chugging it, leaned over to give gentle sips to the two Chetnik commanders he has tattooed on his torso, essentially pouring beer on his own stomach on purpose.\n\nWhen I mention this video to Darko, he smiles and laughs. Then he says, \"That was a long time ago.\" (It had been about 27 months.)\n\nTo me, there are two things that stand out from this display. The first is the prominence of Darko's tattoos. The Chetniks were a group of Serbian nationalists during World War II, and history doesn't quite agree on how cooperative, or combative, they were with the Axis forces during the war. In an effort at clarity, I ask Darko to describe himself politically -- like, why does he have those men tattooed on his stomach? -- and Darko says he is a nationalist but adds that the label doesn't mean the same thing in Eastern Europe as it might in the United States.\n\nDarko's feelings about Serbia are complicated -- the wars, the fighting, the instability of his childhood -- but can ultimately boil down to this: He says of his country, \"I love mine, and I respect others.\" It's a big part of the reason he moved back to Serbia instead of remaining in the United States after he had finished playing, like so many foreign athletes do. Serbia is his home.\n\nThe second thing that stands out about the video is how alone Darko looks despite being in the middle of a crowded party. His face is blank and empty. His eyes are glazed beyond the standard hammered-drunk stupor. He is in his own world. And the hands-off-the-bottle thing, while physically extraordinary, is the ultimate solo trick: It requires nothing -- not even one's own fingers as company -- to accomplish.\n\nA few days after I first meet Darko, he has a party at his house. It is a cookout in the late afternoon, and his friends bring their wives and children. The kids jump on the trampoline. The men play (remarkably shoddy) basketball on the half court. Then there is dinner, and Darko -- in a Serbian tradition -- walks around the table with a bottle of rakia, or fruit brandy, pouring a shot for each guest and standing nearby as the guest enjoys it before moving on to the next person.\n\nDarko does not take off his shirt. He does not let go of his glass. He does not water his tattoos. He is never alone.\n\n6. He kept the cars.\n\nIn addition to teaching Darko how to shower, Billups taught Darko how to drive.\n\nIt was not always easy. In particular, Darko seemed to have a disagreement with Billups on the appropriate way to proceed from one road to another.\n\n\"I'd say, 'No Darko, hold on, you've got to slow down when you're turning,'\" Billups says. \"He's speeding up when he's turning, and I'm like, 'No, you can't do that.' It was scary.\"\n\nFortunately, Billups survived. Darko got his driver's license. And, shortly thereafter, he began to build a fairly remarkable collection of cars.\n\nOver the next nine seasons, Darko spent time with the Pistons, the Orlando Magic, the Memphis Grizzlies, the New York Knicks, the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Boston Celtics. Thanks to the thick-headedness of a remarkable number of basketball executives and the wonders of the NBA's guaranteed contracts, he earned $52,323,642, and he bought a new car at nearly every stop.\n\nNow, walking into the driveway of Darko's mansion in Novi Sad (where $52 million will last \"about 200 years,\" Darko says), it is impossible to miss the luxury cars clumped together like pachysandra.\n\nOver here is a Porsche Panamera with Minnesota license plates still on it. Over there is a Range Rover with New York plates. A Mercedes S600 by the turnaround? Tennessee plates from that hot mess of a stay in Memphis.\n\nIt is not entirely clear why the cars still have American license plates -- Darko makes an obscene (but funny) gesture when asked about it that seems to imply Serbian registration is, in his opinion, optional -- but there they are, gleaming symbols of Darko's misadventure in the United States stuck right out in front of his house.\n\nWhy does he keep them? Part of it might be vestiges of the old superstar lifestyle and, more likely, part of it is that there aren't many cars that are comfortable for a man so tall. But there is something more, too.\n\nDarko moved on quickly from so much of the NBA, even selling his Pistons championship ring and donating the money to charity. The cars, though, he kept.\n\nThe Ford F-350 truck has a dark green body with a lighter green tarp stretched over the flatbed and oversized rooftop running lights. Darko says the truck isn't running now because it got damaged in a traffic accident involving Darko, a dark road, a sharp turn, fog and a herd of cows that were not as visible as one might have imagined. (Everyone was fine, including the cows.)\n\n\"I've had it priced a few times, but they tell me that even a small fix for an American truck like that is thousands,\" Darko says. \"They try to rob me.\"\n\n\"Do you need it?\" I ask. Darko shakes his head.\n\n\"So why not get rid of it?\"\n\nWe are standing about 20 feet from the truck, and Darko gazes over at it. \"Never,\" he says. He looks back at me as if I am crazy.\n\n7. He didn't go broke.\n\nDarko's property in Novi Sad has a giant fence around it. There are three main buildings -- the house, the guesthouse and the indoor pool. There is also an outdoor pool, a playground, the basketball court and a covered, open-sided lounge space filled with outdoor furniture. The dining room in the guesthouse -- or, put another way, the backup dining room -- has seating for 18. The basement of the main house is Darko's hunting room, where the mounted heads of everything from deer to elk to bears peer out with hollow eyes.\n\nOff the back of the guesthouse is a weight room that has a squat rack, leg presses, benches, fly machines and 100-pound dumbbells. There is a fire pit outside. There are 14 bicycles, tricycles and scooters lined up against a wall. Instead of a typical mudroom, there is an area that looks like a sliver of an NBA locker room, with cubbies that wouldn't seem out of place at Madison Square Garden and, on the walls, a giant picture of Darko dunking (while with the Knicks) as well as a framed Darko jersey from his time with the Timberwolves.\n\nI mention all this because it is important to remember that Darko retired in 2012. According to one study from 2009, about 60 percent of NBA players file for bankruptcy within five years of leaving the league, and Darko -- despite his failures while in the United States -- is still flush.\n\nOn the surface, Darko's life is good: He has invested about $8 million into his apple orchard, and growth has been steady.\n\nHe has about 125 acres now, with an eye on more (plus the cherries). His kids go to a plush private school. Zorana has started her own fashion line and runs a couple of boutiques. Their compound has a staff that helps with laundry and dishes and child care.\n\nBut Darko is leery. He feels conflicted about giving his children such a lavish, easy life because he worries that they will take from it the same thing he took from being a basketball prodigy: arrogance.\n\nThat is why, when Darko's son Lazar asks Darko about basketball, Darko is honest. He doesn't tell glory-days stories (there aren't many anyway). Instead, he tells Lazar the worst parts. He talks about not playing, about mouthing off to the coaches, about not putting in extra work. He talks about his own mistakes, his foolishness. He talks about blowing his chance, even if he didn't blow his money.\n\n\"I'm not scared to tell them,\" Darko says one afternoon. But sometimes Lazar gets confused by what he is hearing.\n\n\"When I told him, 'Don't do everything that I did if you want to be good,'\" Darko says, \"he was like, 'Why? You're my father.'\"\n\nDarko shrugs. \"Yeah, I'm your father,\" he said to Lazar, \"but your father made mistakes so you don't have to.\"\n\nDarko shakes his head.\n\n\"You know, he still doesn't really understand,\" he says. \"But he's going to understand in time.\"\n\n8. He is able to say \"this is a funny story\" (as opposed to viewing it as a metaphor for his entire life).\n\nIn the middle of Darko's farm is a lake. Darko had it built. It works in combination with a water treatment system that harnesses rainwater and irrigates the orchards. Above the lake is an elevated dock that includes a small (but air-conditioned) sitting room and porch where Darko can look out over his land and his water.\n\nThere are 10,000 fish in the lake, and they are mostly carp. Darko bought them and stocked the lake because \"the poop and the pee are good for the apples,\" Darko says.\n\nThe fish are aggressive. When Darko throws food off the dock, there is a frenzy of swimming and flapping and snapping that makes the water look as if the lake also has whirlpool jets (which, to be honest, wouldn't have surprised me).\n\nOne day, Lazar says to Darko that he wants to go fishing. Lazar is adorable, a precocious 8-year-old with a soft face and lanky arms and a small dimple. He has big hands, like Darko, but a tiny and determined smile. Sometimes, when Darko is talking to someone, Lazar will just come up and lean his entire body weight against Darko's legs, nuzzling against his giant of a father.\n\nDarko tells Lazar that fishing is no problem as there is a boat in the lake. He brings Lazar and his 5-year-old sister, Lara, up to the lake (the little brother, Luca, 4, stays home). Darko is excited -- he sees how the fish react when he throws food in the lake, and he can't wait to see Lazar's face when Lazar catches dozens of fish.\n\nDarko and the kids get in the boat. They float away from land. They bait their hooks and drop them into the water. Nothing happens.\n\nThey move to another part of the lake. Still, nothing. Darko can't believe it. There are literally 10,000 fish in the water. He knows, because he paid for them. But not one is biting.\n\n\"Daddy, let's go,\" Lazar says.\n\n\"What?\" Darko is flummoxed by the entire situation.\n\n\"Let's go,\" Lazar says again. \"There are no fish here.\"\n\n9. He accepts responsibility.\n\nSo, the horse story.\n\nOnce, when Lazar was about 5 or 6, Darko took him riding on a big horse. Horses have forever been part of Darko's family life -- his parents had a farm, and there were always animals around -- and, even now, despite being the size of a small SUV, Darko still likes to ride. He likes that Lazar is interested in something his father enjoys.\n\nThese days, Darko rides a horse named Astor, who is a 12-year-old \"really, really big horse\" that the stable in Novi Sad found for him. Darko finds riding peaceful.\n\nBut on this day, it was Lazar in the saddle, and as Darko watched by the railing, the horse took off. All was fine, but then the horse began to buck and Lazar began to tremble a little bit and suddenly the boy pitched off the side of the saddle, hanging upside down alongside the horse's flank.\n\nDarko screamed. One of Lazar's legs was caught in a stirrup. His body shook limply, banging against the horse's flanks. His tiny head dangled near the horse's hooves as the animal galloped. If Lazar fell, he would be trampled.\n\nDarko and another man ran out into the ring, shouting. They were able to control the horse after a few seconds, but even once the horse was subdued, Darko found himself quivering. He scooped Lazar up and held him close. Lazar was crying. Darko was so scared for his son and so angry that he turned around and slugged the horse in the face. (I checked with Radoslav Bursac, who runs the stable -- the horse was fine.)\n\nWhen Darko tells this story, over a traditional Serbian lunch plate of meats one day, he laughs nervously. I think it is because he knows that none of it -- the parenting, the abject fear, the animal violence -- sounds particularly good. But Darko tells the story because he sees a lesson.\n\nWhen he was playing basketball, Darko says, he never thought he had done anything wrong. Everything was always someone else's problem, someone else's fault. Larry Brown didn't play him the right way. His teammates didn't realize how much he could help them. The referees screwed him.\n\nNow though, Darko sees things differently. \"I blame myself,\" he says of what happened to Lazar (and the horse). He shouldn't have let Lazar on that horse in the first place, and he knows that uppercutting the horse afterward was not reasonable, either.\n\n\"I didn't train him,\" Darko says. \"It's on me.\"\n\nHe pauses, eating a sausage and looking out the window of the restaurant where we are eating. His face changes from stony to soft.\n\n\"After that, I asked Lazar if he wanted to ride again,\" Darko says. \"I thought he was done. You know what he told me? 'I want to ride a bigger one.'\"\n\n10. A Serbian monk says so.\n\nOn one of my last days in Novi Sad, I go to the monastery Darko attends, which is tucked into a green nook of the Fruska Gora mountain about 25 minutes from Darko's house. The Novo Hopovo monastery is striking. Clusters of deep red roses line a path to the curved entryway. A rising church with a towering cupola shoots above the tree line and into the clouds.\n\nThe monks know Darko. He comes here often. One of them, Father Joanikije, says that one of the most important elements of Serbian Orthodox ritual is the notion of communal prayer. It is not enough to just perform the liturgy; it must be done together, and, afterward, people gather in this tranquil place and talk. Not just about religion or faith or scripture but about life. They share.\n\nDarko never leaves early. This is where he comes for reflection and confession and expiation, and each time, he finds himself thinking about something else he should have done differently when he was playing basketball. He relives the moments that feel the worst. \"You have to talk,\" Darko says. \"When you have something inside you that's killing you, it's eating you inside, you have to talk to somebody. That's the only way you're going to take it out.\"\n\nThe monks see Darko differently than everyone else. When I ask Father Joanikije what he thinks of Darko as a person, he pauses for a beat or two, then says, \"A man who succeeded in life. A man who achieved his goal.\"\n\nThe words sound odd. In all the conversations I have had with people about Darko (including with Darko himself), Father Joanikije was the only person to use that kind of language. Everyone else talks about potential lost or wasted, opportunities that weren't quite seized. Darko wasn't ready. Darko wasn't smart. Darko wasn't mature. Darko couldn't handle it. Darko rebelled. Even Darko stamped his hand on his head and said he was a bust.\n\nBut the monks see none of that. They just see a man who has a wife and children and a business and a comfortable life and a place in the community of his hometown. They see a man who achieved his goal or, at the very least, is trying to right now. So why can't they be right?\n\nThat evening, during the party at Darko's house, I watch him play basketball with his friends. He laughs and jokes, even when shots clang off the rim. No one remembers the score. In the middle of the game, Darko runs over to the fire pit to make sure his potatoes are cooking properly. He shoots with Lazar while the other players get water.\n\nThe sun sets. The players move a little slower. Darko dunks but winces afterward, rubbing his shoulder. Little Luca rides a toy motorcycle around the court. Lazar jumps on the trampoline. Zorana plays with Lara on the slide.\n\nThe game ends. The men retreat to the patio. Darko checks on the potatoes again. He says, \"It's a beautiful night, right?\" and turns on some Serbian music. He pours drinks for everyone and takes one for himself.\n\nThen he sits at the head of the table. His friends shout a toast of love for each other, and for Serbia. Darko stretches his arms out and sings. The NBA feels far away, and he is not a bust tonight. Not here. The glasses clink, and the basketball rolls off into the grass.\n\nSam BordenBorden is a senior writer for ESPN.

Subscribe today!\n\nThe coach doesn't want to think about how many times he's watched the game. He knows it's an unhealthy number, a troubling number, maybe even a shocking one. But he takes the laser pointer and sits down, preparing to attack it with forensic intensity, one more time. He's a detective, unable to shake the cold case that haunts him.\n\nHe pulls down the screen at the front of his classroom and cues up the kickoff, hopeful he might see something he missed the first 50 or 60 or 100 times. He is immediately taken back to Aug. 25, 2017: the knot in his stomach, the helplessness, the grim knowledge of how many lives would change before it's over. He can stop the film before every play and describe it. He'll tell you what the alignment is, what play is called, how it turned out.\n\n\"Now, what I want you to look out for here is ...\" he'll begin.\n\nWe are sitting in his classroom at Fortuna High School, 270 miles north of San Francisco, watching a game that took place at Cardinal Newman High School in Santa Rosa, the first game of Mike Benbow's 10th season as Fortuna's head coach. The objective, as always, is to follow one player, senior Bailey Foley, No. 20, a 5-foot-11, 180-pound defensive end and part-time running back with a reputation for throwing his body around like it didn't belong to him. \"God, he was a tough-ass kid,\" says his teammate and best friend, Ethan Higgins. \"Best word is fearless.\" Benbow tried Bailey all over the field before settling on weakside end, where he was all-county as a junior the year before. \"I just put him out there to blow things up,\" Benbow says. \"He wasn't much for assignment football, but he could destroy plays.\"\n\nBenbow, 48, is a beefy, affable guy who teaches U.S. history and AP U.S. government in cargo shorts, a T-shirt and either a John Deere cap or a Harvard visor. (His daughter, Haley, will be a freshman there in the fall.) It's the last day of finals; graduation is tomorrow, and he is repeatedly interrupted by students asking him to sign their yearbooks. There are team photos on the wall and a sticker that reads \"Hit or Be Hit\" attached to the lectern at the front of the room.\n\nBefore he cues up the game, he runs through his interactions with Bailey from that day. There were no signs of confusion on the 3 1/2-hour drive from Fortuna to Santa Rosa, he says, nothing alarming during warm-ups, no fuzzy interactions during the game. He's been coaching long enough to see the signs: A kid wanders or looks lost in the huddle or stands off to the side trying to collect his bearings. Benbow starts the game, and it plays uneventfully before us. There are plays when Bailey gets hit and plays when he does the hitting, but he never drifts on the outskirts of the huddle or needs help getting off the field. Benbow stops the film on one play early in the fourth quarter. Bailey chases a play across the field from the far hash to the sideline and pulls up as the runner heads out of bounds. \"See?\" Benbow asks, playing it one more time. \"To this point, he's doing all the right things.\" He's right: The game, and Bailey's role in it, is stunningly ordinary.\n\nA few plays later, Benbow stops the film again. Cardinal Newman scored the final touchdown of a lopsided win, and as the teams line up for the kickoff, he says, \"OK, so Bailey's going to return this kick. Watch and tell me what you see.\"\n\nIt's a short kick, to the right side of Fortuna's return team. Foley catches it on a bounce and is almost immediately at full speed. He runs hard and straight -- nothing in his manner suggests even the slightest interest in elusiveness -- until he's hit at the waist and brought down 25 yards downfield. Benbow runs it back twice more, going frame by frame on the tackle. \"Is that it?\" he asks. \"I'm sitting here over and over trying to figure out exactly what could have happened, and that kickoff return is the one thing. He must have gotten hit, but then you look at it and he runs ... he turns ... he's tackled. Where is it? It's not there.\"\n\nThe film doesn't show what comes next. Only a few plays later, Foley jogged off the field, mumbled something about cramps and took off his helmet. He flopped down on the grass and told Higgins, \"It feels like someone's squishing down on my head.\" Higgins ran to Benbow and said, \"Coach, something's wrong with Bailey.\" By the time they reached him, Foley was lying near the 25-yard line. First he vomited, over and over, and then the seizures began. The whole thing, from taking off his helmet to beginning to seize, took 15 seconds. The game was called with less than four minutes remaining. The final image on the screen that hangs in the classroom is a circle of men surrounding a boy on the ground. There is no sound, but the panic is obvious.\n\nThe screen goes dark. The image of the boy on the ground and the men surrounding him burns into the darkness. Part of coaching is finding answers: pick up the blitz and a receiver runs free; block the linebacker and a hole opens; stay home on a reverse and the play fails. Find a problem and fix it. Repetition is the universal solvent, and so Benbow watches again and again, seeking a resolution, something that will save someone else from this torment.\n\n\"Everybody wanted to find that one thing and say, 'There it is, and now we know,'\" Benbow says, his voice rising, his right fist punching the air like a judge's gavel. He gets up from his desk and walks around the front of the room, his eyes never leaving the screen. He is quiet for what feels like forever. Finally, he looks down and says, \"I guess that would have been easier. But I don't know -- would it?\"\n\nBailey Foley could bench-press 215, more than 30 pounds over his weight, and his wiry body was toughened by riding motorcycles and dirt bikes in the coastal mountains and the loamy bed of the Eel River. He was a starting infielder on the varsity baseball team who liked to spend weekends fishing for lingcod 20 minutes away along the Pacific's Lost Coast or for steelhead in the river down the street. He was the kind of kid who is typical of Fortuna -- \"the Friendly City,\" population 12,191 -- but rare most other places: the kind who lived outside. The air in Humboldt County is like damp wool, the climate and topography ideal for growing redwoods, marijuana and tough kids. On the football field, Bailey had a reputation among his teammates and opponents as an eager and sometimes savage hitter.\n\n\"I came here from the city,\" says Higgins, who moved to Fortuna from the Phoenix area after his freshman year. \"We didn't have kids like that in the city. Rough, tough kid that will deal with you if you start something.\" Higgins hesitates, says he doesn't want to get his friend in trouble, but there were times when he was out with Bailey when someone decided to cross him-or worse, one of his friends. The fights were quick and definitive. Higgins says, \"I'd be thinking, I'm glad you're my best friend, because right now that other guy wishes he was.\"\n\nSchool was a problem. \"We always had to worry about him,\" Benbow says. \"Is he going to be with us or not? When we had him, he was great. The issue was getting him there.\" The spring of Foley's junior year, Benbow dogged him to get his grades up so he could be eligible as a senior in the fall. This was a constant fight, and Bailey grew to believe Benbow had it out for him. \"I finally just left him alone,\" Benbow says. \"I told him it was up to him.\"\n\nAs Benbow's voice trailed off, Higgins' gained volume. An honors student on his way to the University of Arizona, Higgins encouraged his friend to take the 10 summer credits he needed to regain his eligibility: \"Our team is going to be good, but it'll be so much better with you. We want you out there.\"\n\nThe easy call was to pass on a summer of schoolwork and forget about football. Get a job, fish, ride his dirt bike. He wasn't going to college, so what was the point? But he had played football in this same town with these same teammates since he was 8 years old. He loved the feeling of Friday nights, of taking the field with his friends and getting a clean hit and feeling the air leave the other guy's lungs.\n\nBenbow and assistant coach Clint Duey -- Fortuna High's principal -- are sitting in Duey's office taking a moment to consider what football did for Foley. They exchange a look that contains all 10 years they've coached together. Benbow, the more diplomatic of the two, starts to talk about grades and eligibility. Duey cuts him off.\n\n\"Football kept him in school,\" Duey says. \"Bottom line.\"\n\nIt's common for Fortuna's players to be the third or even fourth generation to wear Husky blue, and Midnight Madness is the kind of event that brings them all back. On the first day in pads, at the stroke of midnight, the Huskies take the field for a controlled scrimmage. Fans are charged $5 to watch. After sundown before the first practice last August, Bailey knocked on the door of Benbow's office.\n\n\"Bailey -- what are you doing here?\"\n\nHe answered by handing his coach a piece of paper, signed by an administrator just the day before, showing he had completed 10 summer school units and was now eligible to play his senior year.\n\n\"I'm playing football,\" Bailey said.\n\nThe ambulance arrived. Bailey's jersey and shoulder pads were cut off his body. Through it all, Bailey kept seizing. His teammates looked away. Star running back JB Lewis started praying for his friend to stop, to please just stop. He called his teammates together and led a quiet prayer. Dr. Gary LeKander, a pulmonary and critical care specialist who is among a group of doctors who volunteer at Cardinal Newman during games, was one of the first to reach Bailey. He knelt over his twisting body and attempted to keep his airway clear. \"There wasn't much more we could do,\" LeKander says. \"I'll just never forget how quiet it was.\" Higgins watched, crying and thinking, Could my best friend really be dying right now? The rational and irrational blurred. Is this my fault? What if I didn't push him to take summer school?\n\n\u0093I think we all left there thinking Bailey was going to pass away.\u0094\n\n- Fortuna assistant coach and principal Clint Duey\n\nBailey was lifted onto a gurney and rolled into the ambulance as Benbow got into the passenger seat. He was still seizing when they closed the doors. He was still seizing when Benbow called his wife, Tracy, back in Fortuna and told her he wouldn't be coming home. He was still seizing when they got to the hospital, a 12-minute drive.\n\nTwo hundred miles away, Tara Johnson sat in her kitchen in Fortuna and streamed the game on the local radio station. She inched closer to the speaker when the announcer said the game was halted so medical personnel could tend to her son. The broadcast got so quiet it sounded as if it were coming from a studio and not a high school stadium. Tara began to rationalize: The high in Santa Rosa was 87 degrees that day, and even after sundown it was hotter than the boys from Humboldt County were accustomed to. Probably just heat exhaustion, Tara thought. When the announcer told her -- because by this point she felt like he was speaking only to her -- that an ambulance had arrived and the game was over, she promoted her son's illness to heatstroke. He'll get hydrated at the hospital and be fine.\n\nShe was already arranging a ride when Benbow, the crack in his voice betraying his attempts at composure, called and said she needed to get to the hospital. Bailey's 19-year-old cousin, Max LeRoy, showed up at the door and said he would drive Tara and Bailey's father, Sage Foley, the 200 miles from their home to the hospital. They talked about how it was probably no big deal -- \"Bailey's a tough kid,\" LeRoy kept saying -- until an hour down the road LeRoy got a text from one of Bailey's friends: It's not going to be OK. A few minutes later a neurosurgeon called Tara to ask permission to remove half of her son's skull to relieve the pressure caused by an intracranial bleed. \"From that point on,\" LeRoy says, \"I'm not sure we said another word the rest of the trip.\" Tubes were placed in Bailey's brain to drain the accumulated blood, and the removed piece of skull was preserved in a freezer.\n\nBack at the field, Duey, the assistant coach, stood in front of the team in the locker room. He looked out at the stricken faces and listened to the sobbing and thought, They may have just watched a teammate die. He was terrified, but he was the adult who had to find a way to say something -- anything -- that made sense. He had no idea how. He took a deep breath and said, \"It's OK to hurt right now. I know you're all scared, so you need to go hug your families and be with your families and just be there for each other. When we know more, we'll let you know.\"\n\nDuey was fully aware of his talk's futility as soon as his words hit air. \"Nobody knew anything,\" Duey says. \"I think we all left there thinking Bailey was going to pass away.\"\n\nBenbow is convinced that football creates better, stronger people. This is the central verse of his faith. Kids like Bailey present a conundrum; they are the biggest challenge and the biggest reward. Something shifted in their relationship the night Bailey showed up with the summer school transcript. \"He worked his ass off, and he did it all on his own,\" Benbow says. \"I was proud of him.\" After three weeks of inspired practice, Bailey had earned Benbow's highest honorific, one reserved for the handful who can be relied upon no matter the circumstances: Dude.\n\nIn the surgery waiting room, the stunned silence hung in the air like a physical presence. Tara and Sage arrived at the hospital and stepped out of an elevator at the same time their son was being wheeled toward the ICU after surgery. At first they didn't recognize him: eyes closed, black hair covered in bandages, tubes everywhere. Nobody slept. Benbow, his whole body like an exposed nerve, left the hospital after daybreak and drove the 3 1/2 hours back to Fortuna in a school van.\n\nBenbow called Duey as he drove away from the hospital. \"I feel good about him being alive,\" Benbow said. \"I just don't know what that means.\" The conversation came around to the question they'd been asking themselves since the ambulance left the field:\n\nHow can we keep doing this?\n\n\"We talked seriously about whether we wanted to move forward and continue to do this,\" Benbow says.\n\n\"And how to address it,\" Duey adds. \"How to move forward with them? Whether we even should. We spent hours. We talked for weeks.\"\n\nIt would be ignorant to suggest football had nothing to do with what happened to Bailey, but it's equally true that no obvious event could have either foretold it or prevented it. For Benbow, it was an endless back-and-forth. One minute he was telling himself the game didn't cause it, that a healthy 17-year-old boy could fall off the curb and get hit by a car. The next minute he was wrestling with the harsh reality: It happened during a game.\n\nNo one can tell for sure when the veins burst and the bleeding in Bailey's brain began or when he became conscious of the growing pressure under his skull. A neurosurgeon can connect certain dots -- traumatic brain injury that caused a subdural hematoma that caused a stroke was the diagnosis -- but it's impossible for a neurosurgeon to look at the blood pooling in an exposed brain on an operating-room table and say the damage was caused by a collision with a pulling guard with four minutes left in the third quarter.\n\nAt Cardinal Newman, Paul Cronin and his assistant coaches stayed long past midnight, poring over the film in a fruitless search for something that made sense. There was self-interest for their team involved: If there was a definitive hit, Cronin wanted to take it off the team's online video library. \"The worst thing is to be Bailey in that hospital,\" he says, \"and the next-worst thing is to be the one who caused it.\"\n\nThe ripples spread. The next morning, Cronin got up early to drive his 8-year-old son to his youth game. \"What a rough drive,\" he says. \"I mean, it's 8-year-old football, so it's basically bumper cars, but I'm driving to that game with my son next to me, and I'm thinking, What am I doing?\"\n\nThat morning in Fortuna, football captain JB Lewis called a team meeting. Benbow let the players have the floor. They talked about loss and confusion and fear. They couldn't understand how this happened to Bailey. \"It didn't make sense,\" Higgins says. \"They always say be the hammer instead of the nail, and Bailey was always the hammer.\" Higgins said he was sure Bailey would want them to continue playing. Lewis said they could turn this into a positive, to play for a higher purpose. Toward the end of the meeting, they decided that anybody could walk away without repercussions. They vowed to never use the word quit. Only one player decided to stop playing.\n\nLewis delivered a final message: \"If we're going to play for Bailey, then we're going to play like Bailey.\"\n\nWithin days, Bailey's No. 20 jersey had been stitched together and mounted on plywood, and a week after the injury, Higgins carried it at the front of the line when the Huskies entered the stadium for pregame warm-ups. He carried it onto the field for the coin toss and sat it next to Bailey's helmet on the sideline and then held it aloft as he walked off the field. Benbow saw that jersey as he walked onto the field beside his players, and he caught random glimpses of it when he turned around on the sideline to talk to his coaches, and every time it forced him to reckon with his conflicting thoughts. The jersey had a presence; it cautioned as it inspired, and its influence arrived in unexpected ways.\n\nBenbow, as if subconsciously rubbing a scar, hammered home the importance of being honest about injuries. No complaint, no matter how minor, was dismissed. Hard hits were followed by a wincing silence rather than the usual howls. Benbow made sure Bailey was his team's last thought before taking the field and the first upon leaving it. They prayed for him before and after every game.\n\n\u0093If we're going to play for Bailey, then we're going to play like Bailey.\u0094\n\n- Fortuna teammate JB Lewis\n\nBailey remained in a medically induced coma for more than three weeks. He was transferred from Santa Rosa to the Children's Hospital in Oakland on Sept. 25, exactly one month after the injury. In Oakland, Tara slept in a cushioned window seat in Bailey's room. Sage slept where he could: in the hospital's family house, across two chairs in the waiting room, even in the passenger seat of Bailey's Hyundai Tiburon that sat in the parking garage. Weeks became months; Tara and Sage returned to Fortuna just once, for one night. It took Bailey six weeks to say his first words, and they proved to be an endless source of amusement. \"I'm drying meat,\" he said. When Tara repeated the words back to him questioningly, he replied, \"Yeah ... to sell.\"\n\nTara kept a journal for Bailey, documenting the days he would never remember. On Nov. 12, Bailey's 80th day in the hospital, she wrote:\n\nSlept in until 10:00. Got up and used walker to go to the bathroom. Watched football. Took a shower. Watched more football. Used walker again. Got weighed -- 143 lbs. Watched more football. Played Lumosity.\n\nBailey and Sage would watch every possible football game from Thursday night through Monday night. Every Friday, Tara would post a photo on Facebook of Bailey holding up a sign that read \"Go Huskies.\" The student body voted Bailey homecoming king, and the mounted jersey rode through town in the parade and took the field at halftime with Haley Benbow, the homecoming queen.\n\nThrough it all, the Huskies kept playing for Bailey and like Bailey. They entered the playoffs seeded fourth in their division, but upsets on the other side of the bracket brought them a few extra home games. Teams from the Bay Area not only had to make the drive to the Lost Coast but also had to play on Fortuna's muddy grass field, so saturated by late fall that it practically oozed. The Huskies, accomplished mudders, won playoff games 61-0 and 60-6. They won the section championship 44-0. They won a Northern California bowl game to earn a spot in the CIF State Division 5A championship game. \"All of the stuff we'd been through,\" Higgins says, \"we just piled it onto that jersey.\"\n\nThe state championship game was in Anaheim, an 11 1/2-hour drive from Fortuna, and the Huskies stopped in Oakland to visit Bailey. Benbow presented medals for the North Coast Section and NorCal Division 5A championships and promised him one more. Many of Bailey's teammates hadn't seen him since the ambulance doors closed. They couldn't see the steady, incremental improvement that sustained Tara and Sage. They were stunned. He had lost nearly 30 pounds. His voice was weak. He was hunched in a wheelchair, his eyes unfocused. It was unclear whether he recognized them.\n\nSome players hid their faces so Bailey couldn't see them cry.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, JB Lewis leaned down to hug his friend. \"I love you, Bailey,\" he said. Lewis immediately wondered: Did that sound weird? It didn't to him; since Bailey's injury, Lewis and his teammates had spent hours in the locker room and the parking lot and on the field discussing topics traditionally forbidden: gratitude, mortality and, yes, even love. But now Lewis wondered whether Bailey, one of the toughest kids they knew, would sense weakness or even condescension in those three words.\n\nBailey took a breath to summon the volume to be heard.\n\n\"I love you too, JB,\" he said.\n\nThe next night, Sage connected a laptop to the television in Bailey's room to stream the game between Fortuna and Katella of Anaheim. Bailey got to see Ethan carry his jersey to midfield for the coin toss and hear the announcers recount days and weeks and months he can't remember. He watched as the Huskies, with Benbow in the middle, broke the team huddle before kickoff the way they had since the second game of the season: by yelling \"Bailey!\" and taking the field.\n\nIn another improbable twist, Lewis, playing with a broken left hand that needed surgery over the summer, moved to quarterback at halftime after Fortuna's starter left with an injury. He helped lead an offense that outscored Katella 26-6 in the second half of a 54-33 win.\n\nWhen it was over, Benbow walked off the field and fought the churn of emotion. Something terrible happened, he kept thinking as he watched his team celebrate, but something wonderful came out of it. So many inexplicable events conspired to make Benbow wonder who, or what, was dictating it all. \"None of this seems real, even now,\" he says. His team embodied the qualities that form the basis of his faith in high school football. The players fought through their fears and their sadness and broke through the traditional structure of teenage masculinity to bring their little town something it could never imagine. Yet that jersey was still mounted to that piece of plywood, and that boy was still propped in a hospital bed with no recollection of anything that happened in the four months after his brain began to bleed and his body began to seize.\n\nIt's remarkable how closely Bailey's recovery paralleled the Huskies' run through the playoffs. He was discharged from the hospital a few days after Christmas, 13 days after the Huskies won their first state title, and returned to school on April 3, about the same time the Huskies' championship rings were delivered. Benbow presented Bailey with his ring, gave him a hug and said, \"You were a big part of this.\"\n\nBailey rolled the ring around on his finger and looked up at his coach.\n\n\"I'm never going to take this off,\" he said.\n\nBy then, there was no chance Bailey could make up the schoolwork he'd missed, but Tara didn't want Bailey to be handed a diploma out of pity. Duey worked with the district to approve a modified curriculum to be completed outside of the classroom, which left one important task: finding a teacher willing to tutor Bailey at his home three days a week until graduation.\n\nDuey and Benbow are sitting in Duey's office when I ask them how they chose that teacher. They look at each other as if debating with their eyes -- Do you want to tell him, or should I?\n\nDuey pauses for effect and nods toward Benbow, the man who always pushed Bailey and sometimes angered him and ultimately learned more from him than he could ever teach.\n\n\"I made the call,\" Duey says. \"I knew there was not going to be a teacher on campus who cared more about Bailey's well-being.\"\n\nOn a cloudy Wednesday afternoon two weeks before graduation, Bailey and Benbow are at the kitchen table in the little house one block off the main drag. Tara joins them as Benbow patiently helps Bailey read through an outdated chart on the gross domestic product of South American nations. Eight months of watching her son's progress has calibrated her mind to detect the granular elements of his recovery: how his fingers grasp and regrasp the pencil, how his attention waxes and wanes, how his weakened right eye follows the words across the page through a special magnifier on the lens of his glasses. She watches closely as Benbow moves on to charts documenting the rate of infant mortality in various undeveloped countries and the number of TV sets per 1,000 people and per capita health spending as it relates to gross national product.\n\n\u0093Whenever I see him, I wonder if there was something that could have been done, something I didn't see.\u0094\n\n- Fortuna coach Mike Benbow\n\n\"How does the population of Nepal compare to the population of Australia?\" Benbow asks.\n\nBailey tries to find the right column, his finger moving slowly across the page.\n\n\"This row is gross domestic product,\" Benbow says, directing Bailey's finger to the right column. \"And this row is population, so we're looking at this row. So how does the population of Nepal, which is --\"\n\n\"Twenty-three million,\" Bailey says.\n\n\"Good. How does that compare to Australia, up on top?\"\n\n\"It's kind of close?\"\n\n\"Yeah! Write that down.\"\n\n\"What do I write?\"\n\n\"Write 'It's kind of close.' Exactly what you said.\"\n\nBailey picks up the pencil in his right hand and begins to write the answer on the line under the question. The tip travels across the page slowly and carefully.\n\nClose to an hour passes like this. There are four or five questions on each page. They finish three pages.\n\n\"This is all you've got right here, brother,\" Benbow says, holding up the remaining unfinished pages. \"Five pages and you're done. Five pages and you're a high school graduate.\"\n\nBenbow reaches out a fist for Bailey to bump.\n\n\"Good job, brother,\" Benbow says. \"Nice work today. You pumped?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I can't wait to get out of school.\"\n\nBenbow laughs and says, \"I don't know what you're talking about. It's not that bad, is it?\"\n\n\"I think it is.\"\n\nBenbow bundles the papers and tells Bailey that he'll see him tomorrow, and that by the end of the day he'll be a ceremony away from being a high school graduate. Tara, quiet to this point, congratulates her son and thanks his coach as he leaves through the garage and walks down the driveway. The cab of Benbow's truck is quiet as we drive the mile back to the school. He sees the progress Bailey has made, the way the young man's kindling-dry wit occasionally re-emerges -- quietly, unexpectedly -- like a mouse from a hole. The week before, Bailey came into Benbow's classroom and they spoke for almost 10 minutes about their favorite fishing spots. \"It was as close to normal as it's been,\" Benbow says. Three afternoons a week he sits at that little table and finds hope in the smallest victories -- a quicker response to a question, a smoother curve on a lowercase G, a sharper edge to a cutting remark -- and three afternoons a week he walks away from that little table and feels the promise of the present yield to sadness and uncertainty.\n\n\"It's been really good for me to be with him,\" he says. \"There is some guilt. I think that's probably natural. Whenever I see him, I wonder if there was something that could have been done, something I didn't see. I don't control what happens completely, but it's hard because when they're under my care, they're my boys.\"\n\nOver and over the game film reveals no cause, and therefore no blame, yet the guilt weighs heavily on Benbow, and Higgins, and Sage Foley. What if the friend didn't persuade Bailey to complete the summer credits? What if the dad didn't instill a love for football in his son?\n\nBenbow drives on. In many ways it's the best time of his life. He will forever be a legend in his hometown for winning his alma mater's first state championship. His son, Blake, is home for the summer from Boise State. His daughter is spending the summer preparing for her freshman year at Harvard. He can walk out of Bailey's life and back into his own.\n\n\"I just want him to be a normal kid,\" he says. \"But when I leave, I start thinking about the future. I can't shake the thought: Oh, my goodness, what is life going to look like for him? And it bothers me. It bothers me a lot.\"\n\nGraduation Day breaks cloudless and sparkling, the breeze sweeping in from the Pacific like an old friend. Bailey lies on the couch next to his father; he's been awake since before 7 a.m. A college baseball game plays idly on the television. The days and months ahead will be filled with physical therapy and occupational therapy and the vision-therapy treatments that are a three-hour drive away. He's working for the day when he can regain his driver's license and climb back onto one of his two-stroke dirt bikes. His friends will scatter. Higgins will attend Arizona, and his eyes water and his voice breaks just thinking about it. \"I'm going off to start my life,\" he says. \"How am I going to say goodbye to him?\"\n\nBut none of that matters today. Before long the house will be filled with family members, and one of Bailey's friends will swing by to pick him up and take him to the school. As Tara massages his feet, Bailey turns to his father and says, in a voice barely above a whisper, \"I can't believe I'm graduating.\"\n\n\"Yeah, dude,\" Sage says. He laughs and reaches over to grab his son's shoulder. \"What are you going to do with the rest of your life?\" It is an innocent question, something Sage's father probably asked him the day he graduated from Fortuna High. But Bailey, unsmiling, looks at his dad, and for a long moment they stay like this, Sage's right hand on his son's left shoulder, the silence filling the room. Bailey's dark brown eyes fix on his father's, pleading, awaiting an answer of their own.\n\nA few hours later, with the majestic redwoods to the east of the Fortuna High football field covering the mountains like green shag carpet, the stands are packed, as is every overflow chair. Blankets and strollers and wheelchairs cover the sections of the field that aren't roped off for the graduates. The clothing is a mixture of cowboy hats and suspenders, tie-dye shirts and hemp pants. One of the girls has inscribed her graduation cap with \"Save the Bees.\" An elderly woman wears a T-shirt bearing a handgun and the words \"Come and Take It.\"\n\nBailey sits and listens to the talk of college and futures and where the class of '18 will disperse to pursue their dreams. Speakers recount all the silly moments he either didn't experience or can't remember: the bad lip-syncing that's apparently epidemic in Fortuna; the epic impatience of a certain teacher; and who can forget the time Zach baptized himself in the ocean during Senior Sunrise.\n\nWhat were the odds -- the moment those ambulance doors closed -- of Bailey Foley sitting in an aisle seat two rows from the back, wearing a cap and gown.\n\nThe valedictorian ends her speech by telling the crowd, \"You do not peak in high school, no matter what you're told.\" And as the diploma roll call passes through the D's and E's, the announcer abruptly stops reading. The Fortuna High School class of 2018 -- many wiping away tears -- stands and begins cheering as a slacks-wearing Benbow walks past the rows of chairs and stops to help Bailey to his feet. The coach smiles and asks him whether he's ready, and Bailey nods. By now the entire crowd understands the enormity of the moment -- this boy, the one they had read about and prayed for and donated money to -- is not only here but somehow walking across the stage to graduate with his classmates. They stand and cheer and wipe away their own tears.\n\nIn the stands, one of Bailey's cousins tries to send the moment out live but stops when her sobs make it impossible to steady her phone. As Bailey and Benbow reach the base of the stairs, the announcer attempts to say the words \"Bailey Jamen Foley\" loudly enough to rise above the roar, but it's pointless. Benbow lets go of Bailey's elbow and walks ahead. Bailey climbs the stairs alone, slowly but with determination, his body listing a bit to the left. It is strict protocol for the superintendent to hand out the diplomas in the Fortuna Union High School District, but exceptions can be made in extraordinary circumstances. And so when Bailey Foley, outwardly oblivious to the ovation, stops on the X at the center of the graduation platform, he looks up to see Benbow emerging from the other side, smiling but fighting back tears, holding a diploma in his outstretched hand.\n\nTim KeownKeown is a senior writer for ESPN The Magazine and a columnist for ESPN.com.",

    "publish_date": null,
    "authors": [],
    "raw_text": "Editor's note: This story contains graphic material.\n\nCHICAGO -- As he strolls toward the employee entrance at work for the first time in nearly 24 years, Nevest Coleman smiles. He carries a black backpack over his right shoulder, a white plastic bag and travel mug in his left hand. It's March 26, 2018, a few minutes past 7 a.m. In front of Coleman stands a familiar yet new opportunity. And a pair of known faces.\n\nHarry Smith and Jerry Powe worked alongside Coleman as members of the Chicago White Sox grounds crew in 1994. They were friends away from the park, playing video games and sharing stories about fatherhood -- Coleman with a 2-year-old daughter and 3-month-old son at the time. But then, there was a vicious sexual assault, and a woman left for dead. Coleman wouldn't walk into the employee entrance at work for more than two decades.\n\nOver the years, Smith and Powe remained constants at the stadium on Chicago's South Side. Some 350 miles to the southwest, Coleman lived as Illinois state prisoner K-58074, sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years after a jury found him guilty of murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault. But this past November, new DNA evidence prompted a judge to overturn Coleman's conviction, freeing him from prison. In March, another judge issued a certificate of innocence, wiping the conviction from Coleman's record.\n\nTen days before the White Sox home opener this spring, Coleman was back at the park, and back with his friends.\n\nWhen Coleman arrives at the stadium, Smith wraps his arms around him. \"What's up, big man?\" he says with a smile. Out on the field, Smith hands Coleman a White Sox jacket and cap. \"It's good to welcome you back,\" Powe says. \"Now it's official,\" Smith adds. Coleman looks at the stadium around him. In 24 years, so much has changed. The outfield wall and stadium seats, once blue, are now green. The blue metal batter's eye is now covered in evergreens. A trio of shiny new HD LED video boards hang in left, center and right fields. And the name has been changed -- from \"new\" Comiskey to U.S. Cellular to Guaranteed Rate Field. Coleman takes it all in. \"I'm ready,\" he says.\n\nSixteen miles to the south, in Section 6, Lot 20, Row 61 of the Burr Oak Cemetery, a handful of dried-out leaves left over from the fall blows across an otherwise innocuous patch of yellow grass. This is the final resting spot for Antwinica \"Mikey\" Bridgeman. On the evening of April 28, 1994, Coleman found Bridgeman's decaying body in the unused basement beneath the home where he lived with his family. A piece of concrete was shoved down Bridgeman's throat. A conduit pipe jammed between her legs.\n\nSeventeen days earlier, on the eve of her 20th birthday, Bridgeman left a gathering with Coleman and another woman to head home. That was the last time most anyone would see her, until Coleman found her rotting in that basement, wearing the same clothes she had on at the gathering: faded Bill Blass blue jeans and a satin red Bulls jacket with her name embroidered on the chest.\n\n\"I've done hundreds of murder cases, and this is one of those that's going to stick with me forever,\" says Brian Sexton, a former assistant state's attorney who tried the case in 1997. \"This isn't a feel-good story.\"\n\nYou might think this is a story you already know -- the White Sox grounds crew member who spent 8,606 days in custody after he says police forced him to confess to the murder he insists he didn't commit. The man who now has his job back and is rebuilding his life after justice was seemingly served. But the story of Nevest Coleman and Mikey Bridgeman isn't that simple. Murder cases and exonerations rarely are. Six months after Coleman walked out of the Henry C. Hill Correctional Center a free man, two months after receiving his certificate of innocence, his exoneration has produced a fresh round of questions and frustrations surrounding the rape and murder of Mikey Bridgeman -- a case that is now unsolved about a woman who ended up in an unmarked grave. There's a former assistant state's attorney with \"no doubt\" they got the right guy. There are Chicago cops who refuse to let their families go anywhere near Guaranteed Rate Field while Coleman is working. There's the Bridgeman family, which has stayed largely quiet since the case and declined an interview for this story, but expressed through a family friend extreme disappointment in Coleman's release.\n\nAnd then there's Coleman himself, now a 49-year-old brother, father, uncle and grandfather who is finally home. He is a man trying to find his place in this world, wondering with each stranger who walks past whether they know who he is, where he's been and what it was once alleged he did.\n\nThis is the story of Nevest Coleman and Mikey Bridgeman, told through the lens of nine distinct places that have defined this case for the past 24 years.\n\nTHE COLEMAN RESIDENCE\n\n917 W. GARFIELD BLVD.\n\nAPRIL 28, 1994\n\nOn the night Nevest Coleman discovered Mikey Bridgeman's body, his older sister Jennice was prepping to host a Mary Kay party. A foul smell had permeated the house where the Colemans lived, and Jennice wanted her brother to check it out before her guests arrived. The Colemans' basement was accessible from outside the back of the house. Jennice assumed an animal had gotten in and died.\n\nColeman asked a friend who had just gotten out of jail, Michael Barber, to go with him. As they followed the walkway toward the basement door, the smell grew stronger. Coleman and Barber tried to open the door, but it wouldn't budge. They grabbed a flashlight and shined it through a window. That's when they saw the body.\n\n\"It was just like a figure, somebody laying there,\" Nevest Coleman told E:60. \"I jumped back. I didn't know who it was. I told my mom to call the police.\"\n\nWhen police arrived, they pried open the door and found Bridgeman lying on the basement floor. Her shirt was lifted above her chest. Her underwear was around her ankles. A piece of concrete was jammed down her throat. A pipe inserted into her vagina. There was blood almost everywhere. Around the body were empty beer cans and used condoms. It looked like a junkyard, with rusted-out bicycle parts, metal fans, discarded ladders and jugs of paint. Bridgeman's body had been decomposing for more than two weeks. Her face barely resembled a human. Tiny maggots crawled across her chest. The scene was so disturbing that several police officers vomited on the side of the Colemans' home.\n\n\"This is one of the most horrific scenes I have ever seen,\" Sexton says. \"It sticks with you forever.\"\n\nA medical examiner would later determine Bridgeman's official cause of death as suffocation. The piece of concrete was shoved so far down her throat she couldn't breathe. The medical examiner would find teeth in her stomach. Gravel stuck in her vocal cords.\n\nAt the time in the mid-1990s, West Garfield Boulevard, also known as 55th Street, divided this section of Chicago's violent Englewood neighborhood between two gangs. Bridgeman had been a member of the Gangster Disciples. She had switched allegiances to the Vice Lords. Coleman told police he joined the Gangster Disciples when he was 14 but had left the gang before the birth of his daughter, then 2. He also had a 3-month-old son with another woman, his girlfriend at the time.\n\nHe had spent the past two years working for the White Sox, a job his dad had helped him land. He said he never missed a day of work. Friends described Bridgeman as an entertaining, outgoing, life-of-the-party type. She loved the Chicago Bulls. Her boyfriend at the time, Chester Latham, says she planned to start taking college classes. Now she was dead.\n\nColeman left with police for initial questioning. He told them he didn't know anyone by the name of Antwinica. He had nothing to do with this. They drove him home. About three hours later, as Coleman tried to fall asleep on his parents' couch, as he often did, the police returned. Some at the April 11 gathering had told detectives that Coleman left with Bridgeman the last time anyone saw her.\n\n\"They asked did I want to talk to them,\" Coleman recalls. \"Yeah, because I knew I ain't did anything. So I left.\"\n\nAs her brother left, Jennice Coleman looked below from her bedroom window. It was around midnight.\n\n\"I was like, 'Nevest, are you OK?'\" Jennice recalled. \"'Yeah, yeah Jennice. Just go back in. I'm good. I'll be back.'\n\n\"But he didn't come back. That was it.\"\n\nCHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\nAREA 1 HEADQUARTERS\n\n5101 S. WENTWORTH AVE.\n\nAPRIL 29, 1994\n\nAt the police headquarters in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in America, Nevest Coleman sat in a small, windowless interview room, waiting to return home. Police initially did not charge him with anything. There was no lawyer present. But detectives explained they had witnesses who said they saw Coleman walk Bridgeman home on likely the last night of her life. Telling police he didn't know Antwinica? That was a lie. Coleman said he didn't know the name Antwinica. He knew her only by her nickname, Mikey. Coleman explained he walked Bridgeman home as far as he safely could that night. He watched her cross the street. Then she turned around and waved.\n\n\"To me, when you wave like that, it means you're straight, you're safe,\" Coleman says.\n\nHe told detectives that he had no idea how she ended up in his basement but that it had nothing to do with him. After two hours of questions, Coleman says police left him alone for two more hours. Then, as night turned to morning, Coleman says one officer called him a \"lying-a--ed n-----.\" He said another officer punched him on the side of the face twice, sending him into the fetal position. Today, police interviews generally are recorded. That wasn't the case in 1994.\n\n\"I was up for a long time, and they said, 'Give us a story,'\" Coleman recalls. \"'What story?' And they started feeding it to me. That's how the story came about. They wanted me to say I was there. And they fed me a lie. Because, you know, a lot of things I ain't know nothing about and they was telling me certain things to say and I gave a story.\"\n\nColeman says police as well as assistant state's attorney Hal Garfinkel told him that if he signed a confession admitting his involvement in the crime, he could go home. \"I didn't know,\" Coleman says. \"That's what I was looking for, to go home.\"\n\nColeman gave an initial statement. Around 7 a.m., he was arrested. At 9:57 a.m., Garfinkel interviewed Coleman, and a court reporter documented the statement. For seven minutes, that reporter documented Coleman relaying the following story: Coleman was walking with Bridgeman that night when he ran into two other men, Derrell Fulton and Eddie Taylor. Fulton was a convicted rapist, Taylor a convicted murderer. Both men were known Gangster Disciples. Coleman said he suggested they go to his basement to have sex with Bridgeman, who was later determined to have a blood alcohol level between 0.1 and 0.3 at the time. All four of them went to the basement, Coleman said in the statement. But after having sex with Taylor and Fulton, Bridgeman wouldn't have sex with Coleman, he said. She began to yell that she no longer wanted to be there, and Coleman said he instructed Fulton to put the piece of concrete in her mouth. Taylor then grabbed the pipe, Coleman said, and jammed it between Bridgeman's legs. Coleman said he saw Bridgeman's body shake violently. Then the three men fled, leaving Bridgeman to die. Coleman said he then went to his girlfriend's house.\n\n\"He trusted them,\" Jennice Coleman says. \"And he signed it.\"\n\nPolice records show Coleman had been arrested in 1993 for unlawful use of a weapon. He was not charged. In the Bridgeman case, Coleman's signature appears at the bottom of all 19 pages of his statement, including Page 14, where Garfinkel asks, \"How have you been treated by the police?\" Coleman's answer: \"Very well.\"\n\nIn a private conversation before the court reporter was called into the room, Coleman says, he told Garfinkel that police had cursed and struck him twice. He testified that Garfinkel told him he would take care of that later. Garfinkel, who is now in private practice, declined to speak for this story, but his supervisor at the time, John Muldoon, said: \"I can't believe if somebody was beaten and he [Garfinkel] knew about it, he wouldn't have told me. There was no upside for Garfinkel to have done what he is accused of doing.\"\n\nPolice soon found Fulton and took him to Area 1 headquarters, where he was shown Coleman's confession. He then confessed, as well, in his version saying that Bridgeman initially refused to have sex with Taylor. After having oral sex with Bridgeman, Fulton said in his statement, he served as the lookout while Coleman and Taylor sexually assaulted Bridgeman.\n\nFulton also testified that he was mistreated by police, with one officer saying to him, \"You're lucky I don't take you somewhere and put a bullet in your brain.\" Fulton said the officer then struck him. \"That was the last time I saw him,\" he said.\n\nWhen Coleman was allowed to phone home, Jennice says, he told his family the police had beaten him. Later that afternoon, his father saw him at the police station and would testify that his son's face appeared swollen. But Juliette Ferguson, a lawyer brought to the station to help Coleman, later testified she didn't see any signs Coleman had been abused. Sexton argued in court that a photograph taken of Coleman at noon -- shortly after his statement had been given -- also failed to show signs of abuse.\n\n\"There's absolutely no evidence of that whatsoever,\" Sexton says. \"Here's the thing -- if it was somebody else, why would they go, 'You know what? I'm going to pick Nevest Coleman's basement, and we're just going to put the body there'? It doesn't make sense.\"\n\nA judge granted ESPN's request to view the impounded photo, but Patrick Brown of the Cook County Circuit Court Clerk's Office said the Polaroid in question has been missing since 1998.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who want to see that piece of evidence,\" Brown says. \"But I don't have it. Throughout the years of viewing the transcript, it went missing.\"\n\nSexton says criminals often confess because they don't understand the law of accountability. \"Even if you aren't the one actually doing the horrific act, if you're there, you're just as guilty as if you did it yourself,\" he says.\n\nLatham, Bridgeman's boyfriend, told police that Taylor had forced a hickey on Bridgeman's neck the week before. And both Taylor and Fulton had been harassing Bridgeman after her change in gang allegiance. \"I wanted to get 'em,\" Latham says now. \"I called my friend. 'Do you have a gun?' And she was like, 'No, don't do it, baby.' I wish now I would have done it. She'd still be alive.\"\n\nPolice also questioned Taylor, but he never confessed. All three men were charged with first-degree murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault. Coleman and Fulton faced an additional charge of aggravated kidnapping. The state chose not to pursue a case against Taylor, citing a lack of evidence. But with Coleman's and Fulton's confessions in hand, the state would proceed with both murder cases. It would seek the death penalty.\n\nSTATE OF ILLINOIS CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY\n\n2650 S. CALIFORNIA AVE.\n\nJULY 25, 1997\n\nFor more than three years, Nevest Coleman waited for his day in court, hoping a jury would set him free. His defense argued a lack of physical evidence connecting Coleman to the crime -- no fingerprints, DNA, hair fibers, nothing. The state fought back with Coleman's confession and strong circumstantial evidence: Coleman was the last known person to have been seen with Bridgeman. Her body was discovered in his basement, in the same clothes she wore when she was with him 17 days earlier. Coleman testified in the motion to suppress his confession. That motion was denied. He did not testify in his defense at the trial.\n\nAfter a day of deliberations, a jury found Coleman guilty on charges of first-degree murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault. A separate jury found Derrell Fulton guilty, as well.\n\n\"The only thing I thought about was that statement,\" Coleman says. \"If I hadn't given that statement, I would have been home a long time ago.\"\n\nBefore sentencing, 32 people came forward on Coleman's behalf, hoping to spare his life. There were family, friends, a local pastor and a pair of familiar faces from Comiskey Park: Harry Smith and Jerry Powe. Coleman smiled at the two men in the courtroom.\n\n\"When I see them two came up there and speak on my behalf, I was like, you know, that's family,\" Coleman recalled.\n\nBefore Cook County Circuit Court Judge Dennis J. Porter sentenced Coleman, he asked Coleman whether he had anything to say. \"Just to let the victim's family know that I'm sorry for what had happened,\" he said.\n\nPorter did not impose the death penalty, in large part because Coleman had never been convicted of a crime. But he eviscerated the defendant in his closing remarks.\n\n\"These are the acts of a barbarian,\" Porter said at the time. \"I wish I could believe you are sorry about what happened, but quite frankly I don't think that's true at all. I don't think you care any more about that person and what you did than stepping on a cockroach or an ant and walking out of this building. I think that's the way you are.\n\n\"I don't have any doubt at all that you're guilty of the murder of this woman and the aggravated sexual assault of this woman. Absolutely none. I hope you can live with yourself because I really doubt that I could. But that's for you.\"\n\nBefore Coleman left the courtroom, his brother Louis stepped behind Nevest. He placed his hand on Nevest's head. Nevest looked up at him. He had one request. \"Take care of my babies,\" he said.\n\nMENARD CORRECTIONAL CENTER\n\nMENARD, ILLINOIS\n\n1999 - 2017\n\nIn prison, there were nights when the screaming and yelling would keep Coleman awake. And on the lucky nights when he would fall asleep, he'd sometimes wake up, forget where he was, look around and endure the punch in the gut all over again. Prison.\n\nTwo years before transferring to Menard Correctional Center in southern Illinois, Coleman stood in his cell that first night after sentencing and wrapped his fingers around metal bars that stood between him and freedom. He pulled as hard as he could. The bars didn't budge. He says he still believed a lack of evidence would one day set him free. He refused to lose hope. But he also began preparing for a stark reality: spending the rest of his life in prison.\n\nColeman says he tried to keep to himself and learn whom he could and couldn't trust. It wasn't all that different from the neighborhood back home. He says he leaned on the strength of his family members who refused to turn their backs on him and would make the six-hour drive to visit, including his son and daughter, who took joy in climbing on Dad's lap and washing his ears.\n\n\"We used to feed him food and stuff,\" says Coleman's daughter, Chanequa Allen. \"It got to the point where we would sit there and clean his ears for no reason. He enjoyed it. I didn't show him that I cried. On the ride home, I just cried to myself because I want my dad to come home.\"\n\nColeman thought about retreating from his family, thinking it would make life easier on them. But he couldn't. Instead, they became his rock.\n\n\"If you had no family or anybody behind you, that's when you really erupt,\" he said. \"I had my family.\"\n\nHis first two years at Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, Coleman pored through every detail of his case, studying at the jail library and trying to find a school or attorney who might help. But nothing clicked. The letters went unanswered. He tried to stay positive. While he waited, he kept his mind occupied by working. He helped out in the kitchen and by picking up the grounds.\n\n\"I always knew that somewhere there's a loophole,\" he says. \"We always said it's easy getting yourself in. It's hard getting yourself out. And so you've got to find that little loophole where the mistake was. I didn't know how long it was going to take, but somehow, some way, I'd be out.\"\n\nWith each family visit, Coleman would watch his children get older, and his mom and dad grow closer to the end of their lives. Coleman's father died in 2003. His mother died six years later. She had been sick, but the family had decided not to tell Coleman. They didn't want to upset him. Then his brother phoned to tell him what had happened. He was unable to attend their funerals or say goodbye. Chanequa also gave birth to one of three grandchildren while he was in prison.\n\n\"I was angry because the police took that away from me,\" Coleman says. \"They took my mother and my father away from me. They took my uncles, cousins, aunties, my grandmother. They took all that away from me, something I can never get back, you know. And that hurts the most.\"\n\nThe night Coleman heard about his mom, he says, he went back to his cell and just lay in his bed, staring at the ceiling. He thought about the good times with his parents, and about building some of those same memories with his kids. And he recommitted himself to finding freedom.\n\nLOEVY & LOEVY LAW FIRM\n\n311 N. ABERDEEN ST., CHICAGO\n\nMay 2016\n\nIn the spring of 2016, a lawyer representing Derrell Fulton reached out to Russell Ainsworth, a lawyer with Loevy & Loevy and a lecturer with the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago, suggesting he look into Coleman's case. The Conviction Integrity Unit of the Cook County State's Attorney Office had agreed to look at Fulton's conviction in the Bridgeman case and use updated DNA testing to examine several of the items found at the scene. The CIU investigates claims of innocence to determine whether an innocent person has been wrongly convicted.\n\n\"I remember telling Nevest, 'If you didn't do it, whatever happens for me, it's going to happen for you,'\" Fulton says. \"I distinctly remember telling him that.\"\n\nAinsworth specializes in police brutality, wrongful arrest and cases with constitutional violations. To him, two things stood out. Though Coleman had been arrested in 1993, he had never been convicted of a crime. \"It was preposterous to think that Nevest would be charged with his first crime being a horrific rape-murder,\" Ainsworth says. And second, Ainsworth says, some of the officers involved in the case had previously faced accusations of misconduct, including coercing confessions.\n\nColeman waited more than five months for DNA results to gradually trickle in. The scientific precision and accuracy of DNA testing had improved greatly over two decades, but sample after sample came back inconclusive -- until a semen sample from Bridgeman's underwear that had not been previously tested failed to match Coleman, Fulton, Taylor or Latham, Bridgeman's boyfriend at the time. Ainsworth says it instead matched to a serial rapist who had been connected to three other sexual assaults but was free. It was the ticket Coleman had been waiting for. \"I thought we needed to bring these men home and we needed to bring them home right now,\" Ainsworth says.\n\nIn August 2017, Ainsworth filed a petition to vacate Coleman's sentence and conviction. Three months later, Judge Porter, the same judge from Coleman's original case, agreed. On Nov. 20, 2017, Nevest Coleman walked out of prison a free man.\n\nHENRY C. HILL CORRECTIONAL CENTER\n\nGALESBURG, ILLINOIS\n\nNov. 20, 2017\n\nAs he took his final steps toward the prison door, Nevest Coleman didn't speak. Friends and family eagerly waited across the street, including Jennice and Louis, Chanequa and her daughter, Shaniya. Before Coleman walked out of the Henry C. Hill Correctional Center, Ainsworth prepared him for life on the outside. The world moves far faster now, Ainsworth explained. It's going to be difficult to express yourself at times. You might wrestle with your emotions and feel disconnected from family and friends. Just know it's all normal.\n\n\"I wanted to reinforce those things get better with time and I hoped he would lead a full and happy life,\" Ainsworth says. \"But he shouldn't move too quickly. That's how you get in trouble.\"\n\nAs Coleman walked through the door and came into the vision of his family, the squeals of delight grew louder. With each step, the emotion spilled out of everyone. Suddenly he was upon them, wrapping his arms around everyone he could, kissing his granddaughter for the first time. Right there on the side of the road, a family reunited.\n\n\"Seeing my family, grabbed my grandbaby. A beautiful day,\" he says. \"To hold her for the first time. You got that little baby looking at you, smiling. It was great.\"\n\n\"It's like don't run up to him, but I couldn't do it,\" Chanequa says. \"I ran up there and hugged him so tight, didn't want to let him go. The whole car ride home, I'm laughing and staring at him.\"\n\nColeman spent Thanksgiving with his family. He thought about a return to the White Sox. He loved to power-wash. And in February, his old friend Jerry Powe called with a question.\n\nGUARANTEED RATE FIELD\n\nCHICAGO\n\nApril 5, 2018\n\nIn his first game back with the Chicago White Sox in nearly 24 years, Nevest Coleman hoped for rain. He wanted to roll the tarp onto the field. Instead, Mother Nature offered snow, as a barrage of lake-effect flurries filled the air for the 2018 White Sox home opener against Detroit.\n\nColeman had long said that if he ever got out of prison, he hoped to get his job back. When he told Ainsworth and The Rev. William Vanecko, a priest the Coleman family has long known, they reached out to the organization on his behalf.\n\n\"It's a win-win for them to have him back,\" Vanecko says. \"He's a good worker and to do something to help out a guy who's been through a lot.\"\n\nThe White Sox agreed. Powe, now a supervisor, called Coleman to ask whether he wanted to come back and work for the White Sox.\n\n\"I thought he was joking with me,\" Coleman says. \"But he wasn't.\"\n\nAfter passing a drug test, Coleman was offered his old job back. Now he's a celebrity of sorts, given all the attention from his story. It's a part of his adjustment from more than two decades in prison to life as a free man. And it hasn't been easy. Coleman says he doesn't like sleeping in the confinement of a bedroom, instead preferring the couch. Waiting in lines brings back memories of waiting for food in prison, as Jennice found out during an initial trip to the grocery store.\n\n\"The long lines, he was getting fidgety, and I'm looking like, 'Are you OK?'\" she says. \"I kept rubbing his shoulders and holding his hand, and I told him, 'Put your hand on the cart. Are you OK?' And he just said, 'I have to get used to all these people around me.'\"\n\nColeman refuses to wear anything blue, the color of his prison uniform for so many years. And after two decades of prison showers, he loves the comfort of a long bath. \"I just want to sit in the tub, you know?\" he says. He's had to teach himself how to text and learn that you can take photos with a cellphone.\n\nThe first night Coleman stayed with her, Jennice says, she woke up to check on her brother. She wanted to make sure it wasn't all a dream. Sure enough, there he was on the couch. That's when Coleman opened his eyes. \"What are you doing?\" he said. Jennice, startled, asked Nevest whether he needed water. \"No,\" her brother said, \"I need you to stop hovering over me.\"\n\n\"I went back to my room and started crying,\" Jennice says. \"I just couldn't believe that day had finally came.\"\n\nEMBASSY SECURITY GROUP\n\nMOKENA, ILLINOIS\n\nMay 7, 2018\n\nWhen he hears the name Nevest Coleman, Kenneth Boudreau shakes his head in frustration. The retired 28-year Chicago police officer worked as a support detective on Bridgeman's murder case and now is one of more than 10 current or former Chicago officers named in a lawsuit Ainsworth filed on Coleman's behalf in February. Cook County and the City of Chicago also are defendants. In similar cases, Ainsworth says, the plaintiff has received between $1 million and $2 million for each year of imprisonment, meaning a verdict or settlement for Coleman could potentially exceed $40 million.\n\nBoudreau says the story is all too familiar for him. A suspect is arrested. He confesses. A jury finds him guilty. He says the confession was coerced and walks out of prison. Boudreau isn't exaggerating -- especially in Illinois. Of the 227 prisoners who have been exonerated after false confessions in the United States since 1989, 84 are from Illinois. New York is second with 39, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.\n\nLaw firms such as Loevy & Loevy insist a pressure to solve cases and rampant police misconduct have led to a litany of coerced confessions. The police point the finger right back, asserting it's the law firms' thirsty pursuit of big-money settlements that prompts the accused to exaggerate or even fabricate tales of coercion in hopes that doing so could lead to freedom.\n\nIn a six-part series titled \"Cops and Confessions\" in 2001 and '02, the Chicago Tribune highlighted more than a dozen murder cases in which Boudreau reportedly obtained confessions but then either charges were dropped or the defendant was found not guilty. Boudreau insists he has never threatened, struck or violated the constitutional rights of anyone, including Coleman. \"Absolutely not,\" he says.\n\nIn the Coleman case, Boudreau says he spoke to Coleman at the family's home for 15 minutes. He was in the field talking to witnesses while police questioned Coleman. He believes he has been targeted because of his connection to many high-profile cases. He also worked under disgraced former Chicago police commander Jon Burge, who was sentenced to 4\u00bd years for perjury for lying about police torture he oversaw. Boudreau says none of the claims against him has ever gone to a trial. Instead, the city has elected to negotiate settlements, which he says has led to the appearance of a perceived pattern of behavior that now comes up in every lawsuit in which he's named.\n\n\"It's not just garbage,\" Boudreau says. \"It's a travesty of justice what they're doing to this system. If I'm a man in the penitentiary and I'm sitting there for the next 30, 40 years, you're damn right I'm going to think of any which way to get out. But now you get these attorneys involved and it's not only 'I'll help you out' but 'I'm going to make a couple million dollars doing it.'\"\n\nBoudreau said he was \"floored\" when the state issued Coleman a certificate of innocence with nary a fight. He concedes that the new DNA evidence warranted further investigation, perhaps even a new trial. But he doesn't believe it proves Coleman's innocence, as others suggest.\n\n\"There's factual innocence, and there's actual innocence,\" Boudreau says. \"Factual innocence is 'factually I can't prove you're guilty.' Actual innocence is where you are actually innocent. And there's nobody here that's been actually innocent.\"\n\nBURR OAK CEMETERY\n\nALSIP, ILLINOIS\n\nApril 13, 2018\n\nOn a recent spring afternoon, as a bitterly cold Chicago winter finally began to thaw, the final resting place of Mikey Bridgeman, in the northeast corner of Burr Oak Cemetery, remained largely overlooked, save for a few leaves blowing past.\n\nChester Latham, now married and living in Iowa, still keeps in touch with the family. He summed up the Bridgemans' feelings about Coleman's release succinctly: \"Total, straight-up bulls---,\" Latham says. \"Something is wrong with this picture.\"\n\nLatham understands there isn't DNA evidence directly linking Coleman, Fulton or Taylor to the murder scene. But he can't get over the fact that Coleman was the last person known to have seen her. And Fulton and Taylor had just harassed her weeks before. And the body was found in Coleman's basement.\n\n\"It's sick,\" he says. \"F---ing sick.\"\n\nThe case represents the complexities that come with an exoneration. The questions, whispers and accusations. The lack of trust. Coleman is now free, with a clean record, back working with the White Sox. This summer, Ainsworth expects the state to cut Coleman a check for about $200,000, based on the length of his time in prison and his receipt of a certificate of innocence. After that, should he win a verdict or settle his civil case, Coleman likely will become a millionaire. But at what cost? Returning to a normal life isn't as easy as getting a job, renting an apartment and picking up where you left off. Not after two decades.\n\nGiven the certificate of innocence, Sexton says it is \"extremely unlikely\" that the state would ever attempt to try Coleman a second time for the murder of Mikey Bridgeman. Not only might double jeopardy be in play, Ainsworth added, but it would take significant \"legal gymnastics\" for a new trial to now take place.\n\nIn this case, there are only a few absolutes: Mikey Bridgeman was brutally raped and murdered just about the time she turned 20 years old. Her body was discovered in Nevest Coleman's basement. And the DNA evidence on Bridgeman's underwear doesn't match Coleman, Fulton or Taylor.\n\nThe biggest mystery surrounds those tiny molecules of DNA -- and what can and can't be drawn from them. Ainsworth says the semen sample taken from Bridgeman's underwear is \"conclusive\" and \"entirely demonstrates\" that neither his client nor Fulton had anything to do with Bridgeman's murder.\n\nBoudreau and Sexton believe that's a stretch. \"It just shows that she had recently had sex with somebody else,\" Sexton says.\n\nRobin W. Cotton, the director of the Biomedical Forensic Sciences Program at Boston University, has testified in more than 200 criminal cases. She says a DNA sample matching someone besides Coleman and Fulton doesn't automatically prove their innocence. But she does understand why the state didn't feel confident it could retry the case.\n\n\"Regardless of what they might think, the question is what they can prove,\" Cotton says. \"DNA is really good at saying, 'This DNA came from this person.' But how it got there and when it got there is not something you can get from the molecule. And that makes a difference.\"\n\nSays Sexton: \"I don't think we have the wrong guy. I believed then, as I do now, we had the right guy. Do I think he's guilty? Yes I do.\"\n\nNevest Coleman says Sexton is wrong. He had nothing to do with the death of Mikey Bridgeman. And he has a certificate of innocence that backs him up.\n\n\"It's a sad story,\" Coleman says. \"But I'm not the one that done it. You know, that guy's still out there. One day they might get justice, you know? But it wasn't me.\"\n\nWayne DrehsDrehs is a senior writer for ESPN. He can be reached at wayne.drehs@espn.com.",

    "raw_text": "CHICAGO \u2014 Armed with youthful looks and a broad smile, Kamau Murray is an unusual mixture for a tennis coach: He has a brash competitive streak that can serve an elite athlete well, but also a sense of mission that rivals the most dedicated social justice warrior.\n\nMurray, 37, is best known for helping propel Sloane Stephens to an out-of-nowhere victory at the US Open last September. But besides coaching Stephens on the pro circuit, Murray has an even more significant item on his agenda: completing his years-long effort to turn a plot of land on his hometown\u2019s beleaguered South Side into the center of the youth tennis universe.\n\nThis summer, Murray officially will launch a $16.9 million tennis village, an ambitious project that, if he has his way, will alter the course of any number of young black lives in Chicago and beyond.\n\nPlayers began training on the site in January, and it should be fully operational in early March. A grand opening scheduled for July is expected to draw major figures in tennis.\n\n\u201cTo have this on the South Side, it\u2019s just going to be terrific,\u201d gushed tennis legend Billie Jean King, who, at 76, remains a vibrant social activist and one of Murray\u2019s most ardent supporters. \u201cI believed in Kamau from the start. He\u2019s such a great role model for those kids, and he understands that things often come down to access. So many kids don\u2019t have the access just because of where they were born and the circumstances they were born into. Kamau is out to change that. He\u2019s truly one of the great people I\u2019ve met in my life.\u201d\n\nMurray\u2019s involvement in coaching dates to his own youth on the South Side. He was a star player at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School and became the de facto coach of his team in his senior year when the head coach quit. He won a scholarship to Florida A&M University and, in exchange for a graduate school education in finance, worked as an assistant coach on the college team. After graduating, he lasted three months as a pro before realizing he didn\u2019t have all that it took to earn a living on the pro circuit.\n\nBy 2005, Murray had returned to Chicago. A restless pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer, he started coaching kids in the evenings on the South Side. A few years later, one of his students, Taylor Townsend, ascended the junior ranks as a teen and turned pro. She and Murray parted ways a few years ago, and her pro career hasn\u2019t taken flight as many predicted. Still, she\u2019s only 21 and is ranked 97th in the world in singles.\n\nTownsend\u2019s success gave Murray credibility and contacts in national tennis circles, although he had already built a solid reputation in the Chicago area. In 2008, he bought out the only tennis program on the South Side for $90,000 (mostly borrowed from his father) and renamed it XS Tennis. Working out of a building in the Hyde Park neighborhood that had previously housed a Bally\u2019s fitness center, his players started rising in state and national rankings and earning college scholarships.\n\nMost of his players come from the South Side, an area not exactly world-renowned as a tennis hotbed. When these neighborhoods get national attention, it\u2019s typically for socioeconomic ills: gun violence, poverty, racial isolation. So when his students were successful, his reputation blossomed. Soon, kids were coming from all around the Chicago region to train with him.\n\n\u201cMy minority students were beating these entitled white kids in tournaments and suddenly the white kids are asking, \u2018Hey, who\u2019s your coach? Will he train with me?\u2019 \u201d Murray said.\n\nMurray and his coaching staff have worked with more than 2,000 kids individually and through camps and groups. For individual lessons, he charges up to $80 an hour and offers a sliding scale based on income. Some children pay nothing.\n\nHis goal with each student is threefold: to keep them safe in his facility, to help them grow and to help them win. What it takes to reach the last goal can cause consternation in some players and their parents. Murray can be an exacting instructor, pushing some of his talented players to the brink of exhaustion, physically and mentally. A few have left him, but others take on Murray\u2019s fiery nature and compete for his attention and approval \u2014 mostly by winning tournaments.\n\n\u201cMy minority students were beating these entitled white kids in tournaments and suddenly the white kids are asking, \u2018Hey, who\u2019s your coach? Will he train with me?\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen I met with Murray recently, it was clear that he was working to soften his edges. His language was a little less coarse, his words and demeanor more measured than in previous interviews we\u2019ve had over the past several years.\n\nBut this softer pose lasted less than an hour. As we were chatting at his previous XS facility, Murray noticed one of his suburban students letting her temper take control. While practicing with another coach, the teen had slammed her racket into the court after hitting a rather easy forehand into the net. Murray could not let the girl\u2019s outburst go without a response. He scurried down to the court and delivered a sermon, the type of speech his longtime students know well.\n\nFolding his arms and standing in the opponent\u2019s court, he began by asking why she was so upset over one shot \u2014 and he laced the question with a choice expletive. She replied that it was an easy shot and one she shouldn\u2019t have missed.\n\n\u201cOK, you\u2019ve missed how many shots today, in practice, so why did that one set you off?\u201d he asked. Without waiting for an answer, he continued, \u201cThat one miss in practice, or a dozen misses in practice, won\u2019t lose you a tourney. But the negative energy you\u2019re now carrying about that miss will bring more negative energy and will cost you a tournament.\n\n\u201cYou have to learn that this is not a sport for perfectionists,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are too smart to be that person who misses one shot, loses focus and then loses the next five games. You have to be the person who misses and then makes the quickest correction of what caused that miss. Stay in a positive zone. Don\u2019t go negative.\u201d\n\nAs he bounded the steps back toward me, he stopped by the girl\u2019s father, who was watching the lesson. \u201cI will give her any amount of money for her to go home and look up the pro match where there were zero unforced errors. Even the pros can\u2019t do that, so she can\u2019t, for sure. Tell her that on the way out.\u201d\n\nMurray makes no apologies for his acerbic speeches.\n\n\u201cKids who drive past richer places \u2026 come for a little bit more intensity. They are not there for me to stroke their ego or pat them on the back,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they walk into that building, everybody is fair game. I don\u2019t care if you are a scholarship kid or a rich kid, your parents drove 15 minutes extra so I could get you, so I am gonna get you.\u201d\n\nMurray grew up as one of four siblings in an athletic household. His mother was a Chicago Public Schools educator and his father was an attorney and Cook County judge. His father played several sports in high school and was a college basketball player. Each of the four siblings won athletic scholarships to college. But people close to Murray attribute his passion for assisting less privileged children to his mother.\n\n\u201cOur parents believed in us,\u201d said Murray\u2019s older brother, Malik, a Chicago investment banker who played basketball for DePaul University. \u201cHe was a student of my mother\u2019s, really. She challenged Kamau, and all of us, to dream, to rise above ourselves, to believe that anything was possible.\u201d\n\nMurray\u2019s mission now is to instill that desire to achieve greatness in his tennis students. His palatial tennis and sports estate is anchored by a building that holds 16 indoor full-size tennis courts, with another 16 outside (four of them clay). The building also has a gym and basketball court, classrooms for academic tutoring, and a fitness center.\n\n\u201cIf American tennis is going to grow and thrive, it\u2019s going to grow in places like Chicago.\u201d\n\nThe optics are undeniable: The village was built over the past two years on 13.5 acres of land that previously held a portion of the Robert Taylor Homes, once the largest public housing project in the country and one that was notorious for drugs, gangs and tragic childhoods. XS purchased the land from the city and Murray learned how hard it is to pull off such a big development project. He worked donors for more and more cash and jumped through an array of political hoops to get the project greenlighted and completed. His center was originally scheduled to open in 2016, but various obstacles delayed it. One delay involved additional excavation after builders found troves of personal belongings buried in the earth where one of the housing structures had been demolished.\n\nMurray and his financial backers, who include King and Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel (who contributed both personally and with city funds) and dozens of others, hope the facility will spur economic development in the area and serve as a sanctuary for young athletes, many who come from troubled homes. His tennis program offers free or reduced pricing for students in financial need and the University of Chicago provides free academic tutoring.\n\nKing serves as an adviser to the nonprofit XS Tennis board of directors. Murray\u2019s ability to sell his vision to people of influence like her, and to court wealthy donors, is nearly as powerful as his coaching prowess.\n\nKing said Murray\u2019s habit of putting kids of all economic levels and demographic groups on the same court for lessons is pure brilliance. Each has a way of pushing the other, especially the players who come from modest means and see tennis as their path to college. Some, like Zoe Spence, broke racial barriers. Spence, now a college sophomore, is the first African-American woman to gain a full-ride tennis scholarship to Notre Dame University.\n\nMurray is definitely out to change young lives. \u201cSome of my minority kids, they just need one opportunity, to see some kind of light in all the darkness,\u201d he said. So far, his program has sent nearly 40 players to college with scholarships.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not shy about how much more he thinks he can accomplish once his village is fully functioning and gains more attention \u2014 he wants Chicago to be known as a tennis mecca alongside training facilities in the South and West. He wants to draw youth tournaments and players from around the country to the South Side. He noted that three of the four finalists at the 2017 US Open were African-American.\n\n\u201cIn the past 30 years, there have only been two American kids be No. 1 in the world\u201d in the junior ranks, he said. \u201cOne was Donald Young [who turned pro in 2004], and the other was Taylor Townsend, both from the South Side. So I would say, in the U.S., where is your white kid from Florida who has been No. 1 in the world at 16?\n\n\u201cThe first thing I have to do, then, is educate people about that history, when they say that the headquarters of tennis should be in Florida or California. Here in Chicago, whether it\u2019s North Side, South Side, West Side, wherever, we breed tough individuals. So if you look for kids who are resilient and tough, you look and see kids like that. So if American tennis is going to grow and thrive, it\u2019s going to grow in places like Chicago.\u201d\n\nMurray\u2019s work on the South Side is partially what sold Stephens on him in 2016. Stephens grew up primarily in California. Her parents divorced when she was a toddler, and she lived with her mother. Her father, former New England Patriots running back John Stephens, led a troubled post-NFL existence before dying in an accident on a rural stretch of Louisiana highway in 2009.\n\nStill, Stephens never faced the same problems that some of Murray\u2019s students have. Stephens has visited his Chicago facility, and mixing with less advantaged kids brings her own gifts and good fortune into sharper view, said her mother.\n\n\u201cOne of the most powerful components of their relationship is that Sloane admires and respects what Kamau does in Chicago,\u201d Sybil Smith said. \u201cAnd for Kamau, I think he realizes that Sloane needs not only a coach so that she can continue to develop but she needs mentoring. Finding that balance is challenging for any coach. It was a perfect storm for Kamau and Sloane. His junior program gave him the right skill set for her.\u201d\n\nWhile Murray helped prepare Stephens to win the US Open, they have been less successful since then. She hasn\u2019t won a match since the Open in September, and she fell in the first round at the Australian Open in January.\n\nMurray clearly was disconcerted by his player\u2019s finish in Melbourne, Australia. But when I asked him about their status recently, he replied, \u201cAll is good.\u201d (Stephens\u2019 publicist would not make her available for an interview, saying that she was in training. But her interview session after the Australian Open showed her to be upbeat despite the early exit from the tournament.)\n\nStephens\u2019 mother said Murray\u2019s hands-on mentorship is needed by her daughter. The night before the US Open final against Madison Keys, for example, Stephens suffered from extreme anxiety, and her mother texted Murray, asking him to visit her in her hotel room for counseling. This was unusual \u2014 Murray and Stephens had a routine in which they would part ways after a day of tennis and not reconvene until the match or practice session the next morning.\n\nOnce at Stephens\u2019 hotel room, Murray realized that his player was in a panic. He didn\u2019t have a speech prepared for such an occurrence, so he called an audible. He figured she needed to be reassured that she had the talent and the game plan to beat Keys.\n\nMurray grabbed a marker, drew up some X\u2019s and O\u2019s and showed Stephens how he wanted her to hit as many shots to Keys\u2019 forehand as possible.\n\nAt the time, Stephens thought her coach had gone mad.\n\n\u201cMadison has the best forehand in the game,\u201d Stephens told him. \u201cAre you trying to end my career?\u201d\n\nMurray explained that, yes, Keys has an incredible forehand. But studying hours of video had taught him that while Keys lives on her forehand, she doesn\u2019t like to hit it while moving to the right. His theory: Make her move to the right as much as possible and take her out of her comfort zone.\n\n\u201cI wanted her to put Madison in a little box over there in the right corner and keep her there,\u201d Murray recalled. \u201cSloane bought into it, and it worked beautifully.\u201d\n\nGetting people to buy into his plan is perhaps Murray\u2019s greatest gift, whether it\u2019s a pro tennis player on the verge of stardom or a teenager from the neighborhood searching for a path to a better place.",

    "raw_text": "People have traveled from all over the world to write stories about Harrold, Texas, and aesthetically, it's hard to figure out why. It looks the same as most other stops in North Central Texas, with goats and wind turbines and a 7-Eleven a mile and a half down the road.\n\nSometimes, a wild pig or a tornado will break up the monotony. Harrold's school superintendent, David Thweatt, was making his 45-second commute one day when he heard a noise and looked down to see a rattlesnake slithering around the wheel of his bike. He grabbed a BB gun, took aim, and that's all he has to say about that snake.\n\n\"We live in the middle of the country,\" Thweatt says. \"We are at least 30 minutes from a first responder. When you live in the country, you do everything yourself.\"\n\nIn 2008, Harrold became the first school in the United States to allow its teachers to carry concealed guns in class, and the international news media pounced. CNN, the BBC -- pretty much all the big news acronyms -- came calling. The crush was so intense that Thweatt asked his football coach, who also serves as the principal and athletic director, to help with the phones.\n\nEight years later, Harrold found itself in the middle of another national controversy when it challenged a federal transgender bathroom policy.\n\nBut now it is summer in rural America, and all is quiet in the old brick building except for the bubbling of Thweatt's aquarium.\n\n\"Do you want to talk about science?\" asks Thweatt, who loves to talk, and seems disappointed when the answer is no.\n\nThere's another story to be told in Harrold, and it's even better.\n\nIt's about friendship, death, and a football season saved by a 5-foot-2, 135-pound girl.\n\nStorefronts don't close for Friday Night Lights in Harrold because there are no storefronts. But for as long as anyone can remember, football has managed to sprout up each fall in a land that in many ways seems infertile. One recent population count lists Harrold with 175 inhabitants, though by Thweatt's count, that's an exaggeration. The graduating class of 2017 included six girls and three boys, a nightmare on prom night, and even worse if you're fielding a football team.\n\nHarrold plays six-man football, which, in rural Texas, is about survival. The fields are only 80 yards long because the boys who play are generally worn out from lining up on both sides of the ball. Six-man athletes are not behemoths engineered in million-dollar weight rooms. Often, they're small and lean because they're constantly running.\n\nThe Texas towns they're from are barely hanging on, too, places like Spur and Happy. And Harrold.\n\n\"My first two years here, we averaged 25 boys for football,\" says Harrold coach Craig Templeton, who has been at the school for more than two decades. \"But the problem was, if you looked at the girls' side, I think we had seven or eight girls playing volleyball or basketball. It's just a cycle we're in right now.\"\n\nTempleton, who has pictures of John Wayne scattered throughout the walls of his office, never could have imagined back then that the numbers would dwindle so low that it would put football in jeopardy. Or that a shy, diminutive water girl would save the season.\n\nBut even in small towns, there are hidden surprises. Coach T -- that's what everybody calls him -- went into the summer of 2016 with only six players. No bench. But he wasn't all that worried. He runs his football camps kind of like a track practice, with 60, maybe 70 40-yard dashes each workout to build the players' stamina. Plus, he had Brady Blakley, one of the area's best players, back for his senior year. They'd get by.\n\nMore From SC Featured\n\nIn Texas, everything is big, even six-man football which is played in more than 250 high schools across the state. Chris Connelly tells the stories of two small-town teams hoping to make an impact on and off the field: A girl jumps in to save the season and the ultimate underdog takes on the state champs. Listen to the podcast \u00bb\n\nBut just before camp, one of the boys transferred, and Templeton knew the Hornets would not be able to play the season with five. The ragtags they had, outside of Brady, did little to inspire confidence. Half the team was composed of freshmen, and the battle for the starting quarterback job consisted of Templeton saying, \"I need somebody to take the snap.\"\n\nCreed Henry, blessed with an awesome name for Texas football but a body in need of a few hundred doughnuts, said, \"I'll do it.\"\n\nCreed's father is a cowboy, so Templeton figured the kid would be tough. Chris Henry was a late bloomer, too, but now he's nearly 6-4. In the summer time, Creed gets up around 4:30 each morning to help his dad. Part of his job involves throwing calves to the ground and holding them while they're branded.\n\nCreed weighed all of 91 pounds.\n\nSo yes, Harrold was in deep bovine doo-doo. But the prospect of not having football seemed unthinkable, not just because of history but because of Brady. He was so devoted to football that he switched from his natural position on offense, center, to fullback and did not squawk one bit.\n\nHe loved it because it connected him with his father. Mike Blakley also played football at Harrold, a Hornet through and through. In the fall of 2015, Mike sat in a Ford Explorer parked as close as it could be to the football field. His brain and his lungs were full of cancer, and he had to know the end was near. He wanted so badly to get out of that SUV and lean against the fence so he could be closer to his boy.\n\n\"He couldn't talk real good,\" says Mike's middle son, Josh. \"He was trying to scream as loud as he could for Brady, but just like a little whisper came out.\n\n\"Brady scored three touchdowns, and I remember [my father] was happy. He was really happy.\"\n\nA little more than a week later, Mike Blakley was dead. And football was about all Brady looked forward to. What would he do without it?\n\nOutside of cloning someone, Templeton was running out of options. He walked though Harrold's gym one day while the girls' volleyball team was practicing and jokingly asked whether any of them wanted to play football. Olivia Perez, the team's all-district setter, actually had been pondering that very question. She'd been the student manager and water girl for the football team in past seasons, but more important, she was good friends with Brady. He'd told her that there might not be a football season, and she knew how desperately he wanted to play for his father.\n\nCarla Kent, Harrold's volleyball coach, knew what Brady was going through. When Kent was in high school, she also lost her father. But here's the deal -- the volleyball team was also at the bare minimum of six bodies, so when Olivia told her coach that she wanted to moonlight on the football team, Kent's reaction was pretty much what you'd expect: \"Are you serious?\"\n\n\"I knew we had a good chance of winning districts,\" Kent says. \"If she got hurt, our season was over.\"\n\nOlivia had a minimal grasp of the game of football. She'd never seen a playbook, let alone been tackled by a boy twice her size. But she'd always liked watching it, and her mind was made up. In a Snapchat conversation with Brady, she told him she'd play -- for him. Kent and Templeton would devise a plan to share Olivia's time, and sometimes, it resembled a fire drill of uniform changes and venue sprints.\n\n\"She was scared to death when she got out there,\" Templeton says.\n\n\"You don't hear of kids doing this. It's so unselfish.\"\n\nThere was a time, many years ago, when Harrold was a boomtown. It was the last western stop on the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway Company. Stores and churches were built, and there were at least 16 saloons. It was the late 1800s. According to the Texas State Historical Association, prospective settlers were offered train rides to Harrold and were welcomed into town by a brass band.\n\nBut then the railroad expanded past Harrold, and the town began to shrink. Today, the only music at night is the sounds of trains, cows, critters and the highway.\n\nTempleton and Thweatt love the solitude of Harrold, and the sense of community it provides.\n\n\"Everybody in town will look out for each other,\" Templeton says.\n\nHarrold's school serves kindergarten through 12th grade in one building. Many of its students come from neighboring small towns. Thweatt says a good number of them live less-than-ideal lives. He estimates that more than 70 percent of the student body qualifies for reduced lunches.\n\nOlivia's life, even before football, was by no means easy. Her dad heads to work around 2 each morning at the Bar-S factory in Altus, which is about an hour away and across the border in Oklahoma. He gets home roughly 14 hours later to help take care of his wife, who suffered a stroke two years ago. Maryann Perez was only in her late 30s when she had the stroke, and doctors say that's rare. She has never been the same.\n\n\"Sometimes, she'll try to talk to me,\" Olivia says, \"but she can't think of what she wants to say.\"\n\nMaryann Perez's sister, Malinda Vazquez, goes to most of Olivia's games. Vazquez says Olivia practically takes care of herself. She works at the United grocery store in nearby Vernon, Texas, and was already juggling volleyball and basketball with school, where she made National Honor Society.\n\nVazquez is thankful her niece has sports. It gives her structure, and a distraction. Olivia stays at her aunt's a lot, probably because it feels more normal. She didn't tell a lot of people about her mom's stroke. Her volleyball coach didn't even know about it for a while.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Kent says, \"trying to get her to open up and talk is a challenge.\"\n\nBut with Brady, it was easier to share her feelings. She'd been friends with him for a while, but their bond deepened when their parents got sick. Harrold played Chillicothe the day before Brady's dad died. The opposing team wore purple socks to honor Mike Blakley, and both squads gathered in a circle to pray. Brady finally lost it outside the locker room and cried on Olivia's shoulder.\n\n\"Sometimes, I would be listening to music, and it would get me feeling sad and I texted Brady at 10 or 11 at night,\" Olivia says. \"He always knew something was wrong if it was that late. Then we'd start talking about what was going on, and he was like, 'Keep your head up. I'm always here for you.' It was just comforting.\"\n\nIt was easy to spot the girl on the team. She was the one with the shoulder pads so big they nearly covered her face. But Olivia never complained. She had a couple of her volleyball teammates help her get dressed each game, sliding her jersey over the pads.\n\nIt seems sort of strange, that a school caught up in a restroom battle now had a girl inhabiting the boys' locker room. But Olivia never paid much attention to Harrold's controversies. During home games, she'd change in the bathroom or the girls' locker room. On the road, if there was only one place to go, she'd either change first while the rest of the team sat outside the locker room, or they'd change while she waited.\n\nBefore the first game, she told her Aunt Malinda that she was nervous. \"You're gonna be fine,\" Vazquez told her. \"You're strong. You're a tough girl.\"\n\nTempleton did his best to try to protect Olivia on the field. Harrold is a run-heavy team, so Templeton would use her as a wide receiver and on most plays ran away from her. He also hid her on defense and special teams, as much as you can hide someone when you have only six players on the field.\n\nThere was sort of an unspoken understanding among the local teams that no one would lay a hard tackle on her. Chillicothe's coach took it a step further, according to Olivia. \"He said if anybody hit me really hard, he was going to make them run,\" she says. \"I think that's cool.\"\n\nThat was violated just once, against rival Northside. Olivia took a hard shot, and Brady was livid. He grabbed the kid by the face mask and threw him down.\n\nBut the 2016 season wasn't much of a fight. Harrold lost its second game of the season by 59 points, then followed it up the next week with a 50-0 loss.\n\nNobody had the luxury of a day off. Brady played one game with a rolled ankle and the flu. He didn't want to complain about it, but his head was throbbing, he was sweating and he couldn't see clearly. He couldn't play anymore, and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Harrold couldn't finish the game.\n\n\"Most of the time my legs were sore,\" Brady says. \"Every day after Friday, I'd wake up sore. There were games I'd be tired, and I'm like, 'Give someone else the ball, please. I'm out of breath.'\n\n\"Yes, it sucks getting beat. But you have to fight through it.\"\n\nDespite all the losses, Brady had no regrets. He'll have a Harrold team photo, just like his dad, and no one will remember the beatdowns, or that these players were any different. They were just like every other school in Texas: They played football.\n\nWhen Mike Blakley told his older sons 19 years ago that he was going to be a father again, they couldn't believe it. Toby and Josh Blakley were adults by then, and Mike was in his 50s. Toby joked that his family was a Jerry Springer episode, complete with nephews older than uncles, and that his dad was Charlie Chaplin. \"You can't write s--- like this,\" Toby says. But in the end, things turned out just fine.\n\nBrady gave Mike the chance to have sort of a do-over. The father Toby and Josh knew was a welder who worked long hours and spent far too much time on the road. He was strict and detached but always provided food for the table and clothes on their backs.\n\nIn some ways, Toby, who has a different mother than Brady, sees himself in his little brother. Toby was also a star football player, at a bigger high school, and probably could have played in college. But he lacked discipline and focus.\n\n\"I wanted to drink beer, and I wanted to party,\" Toby says. \"And let's be honest, I didn't have a lot of direction. Nothing against my parents. ... My dad, he's a great provider, and he provided for us very, very well. But he wasn't available for decision-making. I relied on my coaches.\"\n\nWhen Brady came along, Mike became more active but also more of a pushover. Brady could get away with things Josh and Toby never would have dreamed of. Brady's grandmother, Cynthia, described a childhood in which Mike would indulge the boy with just about anything he wanted. But no one questioned the father's heart.\n\nBrady's parents split up when he was young, and Mike took him back to the place he knew, in north Central Texas, and raised him alone. He loved watching the kid play. They spent many days talking about football.\n\nWhen Brady would get out of line, Mike sometimes threatened that he'd call Toby or Josh to deal with him. The family had nicknames for one another. They called Brady \"Meathead.\"\n\nToby went on to be a Marine, then a chef; Josh was in the Army, then became a police officer in Vernon. In Mike's final days, he was too sick to care for the boy, so Brady went to live with Josh and his family. He needed that stability. Josh is 38, young enough to play video games and relate, old enough that people mistake him for Brady's father.\n\nHe worries about Brady. He wants him to go to college, wants him to keep his options open. But Brady is set on joining the Army after high school, and no one can persuade him otherwise.\n\n\"He is mature, but then you want to make sure he's making the right decisions,\" Josh says. \"That's why I try to have a finger in on everything he does. Because I've lived most of my life.\n\n\"He's been through a lot. Not a lot of people have to go through what he's been through.\"\n\nThe Class of 2017 graduated on a Friday night in May. A bad storm with a tornado warning rolled through the county the night before, knocking out power in Harrold. Help comes slowly sometimes in rural Texas, and the last time the power went out, during an ice storm this past winter, Templeton says, they waited eight days for it to return.\n\nBy Friday morning, then Friday afternoon, there was still no electricity. So Thweatt and Templeton brought in generators to light the gym. It would be a graduation everyone would remember, they figured. Just before the ceremony started, sun gave way to a pounding rain.\n\nEarlier in the day, Templeton sat at his desk, thinking about the last time he saw Mike Blakley. It was when Mike was in hospice care, just before he died. Even then, Mike was thinking about this day, and the moments he'd miss. \"Coach T,\" he told Templeton, \"you make sure Meathead walks across the stage.\"\n\nAnd now the day was here, and Templeton was a jangle of emotions, excited for Brady's future, sad to see him go. You become more attached to a kid when he's one of only nine in a class.\n\nBrady inherited at least four father figures when Mike died. He had Josh and Toby and Coach T and Mr. Thweatt. They laughed when one of the graduation speeches mentioned Brady's propensity for passing gas in class. They watched when the video montages of the seniors were projected on a wall. There was Brady as a little boy, being a stinker. And there was his father.\n\nThe graduation ended, and Brady found Olivia and they hugged.\n\nShe is now a rising senior. Her class consists of three people.\n\nOlivia dreams about going to college. She'd be the first in her family to do it. She has three older siblings, and they all work in food service. One of her sisters didn't graduate from high school. She got caught up working at a restaurant, skipped class and never finished.\n\nLike many kids who go to Harrold, Olivia lives in a neighboring town. She's from Vernon, which, at around 10,000 people, is almost a metropolis. She sees the drugs in town, the people stuck in their lives, and desperately wants to get out.\n\nOlivia was over at her aunt's house recently when she started to stress out about what she'll do after graduation. She thinks she might want to become a nurse or a veterinarian. Vazquez reassured her: \"You can be whatever you want to be. It's up to you.\"\n\nHad Brady gone to a bigger school, maybe he'd be thinking about college, too. He was a good six-man player: an explosive fullback, a sturdy lineman, a solid middle linebacker. Really, Brady could play anywhere. But in this story, the most talented kid on the team is a realist. He knows the limitations of small-town football, and the limitations of his 190-pound body.\n\nHe was invited to two all-star games this summer, including the Greenbelt Bowl, a showcase for small-town players who might otherwise be overlooked for college scholarships. It was an 11-man game, and Brady held his own, getting a sack and a couple of tackles. But he had no offers for a full-ride scholarship.\n\nGraduation came at a time of big changes for the Blakley family. Josh wants to leave the police force and move to Dallas. He plans to get his master's degree and work in the ministry.\n\n\"I'm kind of burned out,\" Josh says. \"The criminals have more rights than the officers do nowadays. You gotta be real careful out here what you do.\"\n\nBrady planned to move in with Toby during the transition. Toby also lives in Dallas, and is known as being strict. Toby remembers a time, near the end of his dad's life, when Mike used to tell him he had to come and watch Brady play. Mike said the way Brady played reminded him of Toby -- both played with a lot of heart.\n\nThe words made Toby well up with emotion. He never saw his dad as an encourager when he was playing football; Mike always pointed out everything he did wrong. And now Toby was proud to be compared to his brother. Six-man football, he said, requires a certain kind of toughness. Especially in Harrold. It's about getting beaten up and humbled every week, and coming back for more. It's about not having any regrets, even when your efforts don't produce any wins for two seasons.\n\n\"He had perseverance,\" Toby says. \"He would not quit, and if you put another kid, a teenager, in that situation ... they're more than likely to quit. Not Brady. Even though he's a knuckleheaded kid, you could see leadership and perseverance develop because of that dynamic.\"\n\nIt's a late-June night in Vernon, and Brady pulls into a Braum's fast-food restaurant to meet Olivia. He arrives with some news: He has just been accepted into the Army's military police program and will ship out at the end of August.\n\nIt's exactly what he wanted, to be in the military like his brothers, to have a purpose. He talks about paying his own bills and going his own way. Being a man. He wanted this so badly that he's been lifting weights all summer at a gym in Vernon. Olivia is drinking a shake at Braum's, and Brady is asked whether he wants anything, but he quickly says no, he's in training.\n\nHe is so excited to ship out that he starts to recite his extensive itinerary, which he seems to have memorized. He wishes he could leave tomorrow. Olivia is sort of jolted by the news. They haven't had a lot of time to talk this summer. He's been traveling; she's been working.\n\nMore From Doubletruck\n\nDoubletruck is the home for ESPN storytelling, a place to find great features, investigations and character portraits. Doubletruck home \u00bb\n\nEventually, the subject turns to football. Templeton has only five players again, and Coach T has warned coaches around the area that Harrold might not have a team. Olivia tells Brady that she's going to play because Coach T, and the team, needs her.\n\nBrady doesn't think it's a good idea.\n\n\"If you get hit, who's going to come up and protect you?\" he says. \"[The team] is all small. Coach T can't run on the field. All he can do is probably cuss and get kicked out. That would make Harrold look bad.\"\n\nThey agree to disagree. All of the angst Brady had in the summer of 2016 is gone, and Harrold -- and football -- is in the rearview mirror, probably forever. He heads outside to his Mustang and tells Olivia he'll see her in five years.\n\n\"Don't say that,\" she says, figuring he must be joking. They've been through too much.\n\nTwo weeks before camp started, on July 27, Templeton got a text. It was from Creed Henry. Throughout the year, Templeton kept a scale next to his desk, and every week, young Creed stepped on that scale and measured his progress. By summertime, he was up to 107 pounds, and Templeton was pumped. But this text was not good news. Creed's father helped him compose it because Creed didn't know exactly what to say. Chris is changing camps on the ranch, moving to a less stressful job, and now the family must move to another county. Creed will be transferring to Crowell, a rival team in Harrold's district.\n\n\"I hate to see it,\" Templeton says. \"It's not something he's looking forward to doing. [But] family has to do what it has to do. I understand that 100 percent.\"\n\nThe move probably will be better for Creed. Crowell went 11-2 last year and had one of the best passing games in six-man. No more endless beatdowns or worries over whether he'll have a season. But Chris has mixed feelings about his boy switching teams. Harrold has a special place in their hearts. \"They were so small,\" Chris says, \"but they sure were determined.\"\n\nAround the same time the news about Creed hit, Templeton found out another player is transferring, too. It means Harrold most likely will not have a football team this fall. Templeton can't imagine what that will be like. Much of his life has been spent preparing for the next football season. He believes it will be temporary. Harrold's eighth-grade class is loaded with boys, he says, and they'll be back.\n\nIf there is no football in 2017, he says, the boys will compete in cross country. They'll train under the hot sun, run for miles, and get ready for basketball and 2018.\n\nThey'll do the same thing generations before them have done. They will take what they have and make do.\n\nElizabeth MerrillMerrill is a senior writer in ESPN's features and enterprise unit.

    "raw_text": "This is the cover story for ESPN The Magazine's June 18 World Football issue. Subscribe today!\n\nPaul Pogba stands in his kitchen and mists himself with cologne. The Pogmood is Pogtense. A strong Arabian musk crossed with bright athletic notes might chase away his uneasy feeling. He gives a generous spray on each side of his neck, one spray for each arm, with a torso shot or two for good measure. You can always smell Pogba before you see him. Its work done, the fragrance bottle goes back into his white snakeskin dopp kit, which he can always identify as his because of the enormous gold-plated No. 6 on the side. Like all people who started in obscurity and live in fear of returning to it, his name and image are never far from his line of sight: excessive branding as a sophisticated method of clawing at a crumbling cliff's edge. It's a Tuesday between the end of Manchester United's season and the team's FA Cup final down in London, and Pogba had been feeling good until he opened a text message from the team. Now he's thrown off-center, and this creates widening ripples in the Pogforce.\n\n\"The club changed all the travel plans,\" his manager says. \"They unbalanced him.\"\n\nThe Red Devils are now leaving tomorrow at 7 a.m., the whole trip pushed up a day. Since players are due at pre-World Cup camps, losing a day means losing time to close up houses and carefully pack. Pogba, just 25, lives in a Manchester suburb that's home to dozens of current and former Premier League stars who whip around the leafy streets in luxury cars. Hanging around his house today are his Parisian boyhood friend and gofer Mamadou, his Bolivian-model girlfriend Maria Zulay Salaues, his Brazilian manager who lives in Monaco and speaks six languages, and, of course, his cook, who hails from Naples and chatters away in Italian as she futzes around the kitchen.\n\nMore ESPN The Magazine\n\nPaul Pogba is ready to shine\n\nThe New Hooligans of Russia\n\nLionel Messi is the quietest superstar\n\nThey are the champions\n\nSubscribe to The Mag\n\nThese four friends, along with his mom and two brothers, protect him from the circling wolves of criticism. He's in that dangerous career zone in which his immense potential, long the source of his wealth and fame, could become the central exhibit in the case for his failure. Manchester United bought him in 2016 from Juventus for upward of 89 million pounds, the largest transfer fee in history at the time, and he's worn that scarlet number around his neck. Tabloids compare him to the other biggest busts in football history. Sometimes he doesn't even start.\n\nIt's not all his fault. Most people can see that Pogba's free-flowing game doesn't fit with manager Jose Mourinho's conservative style. He's a sequined jacket in a hit man's closet. These could be his final days living in this house and city as he decides whether to run again or stay and fight for his future. Russia is coming at the perfect time for him. No other player on the planet needs the psychic reboot of a World Cup as much as Pogba. \"He is at an important crossroads,\" says Mamadou's brother, \"Papis\" Magassa, who coached Pogba in their neighborhood in Paris.\n\nToday's anxiety over schedules and packing clashes with the boyish spirit of the house, which is a bedroom poster dream of where a footballer might live. Nobody should ever feel sad in such a ridiculous place. Big windows look out onto trees and hedges. The kitchen glows green when the afternoon sun shines through the limbs and branches. Out front rises a towering fir tree just like those in the common area of the French public housing complex where Pogba grew up. The interior is decorated with pictures, trophies, murals and, obviously, his interlocking \"PP\" logo. He's got the logo on his pool table and on his custom black-and-gold foosball table and on the four throw pillows fluffed and ready on his giant L-shaped couch. A logo is on the center of his small, caged indoor football pitch -- which is where the indoor pool used to be -- and there are paintings of him in celebration on the wall. He's got the logo in his ears, one on each earring, in case he happens upon a mirror. Some people design for comfort or aesthetics. His house is designed for confidence, a place where he can celebrate one of those missile shots he calls a PogBOOM! The white marble floors shine. The lines are cold and modern. The stairs are hard plastic trays filled with fake diamonds, and in the stairwell, a huge taxidermied lion rests its left paw on a soccer ball, as if it might launch a well-timed and kingly cross to a streaking kudu.\n\n\"I make it the Poghouse,\" Pogba says.\n\nAs he says this, Pogba is facing his enormous fish tank. The Pogtank! He's a Pisces, Mamadou explains, hence the fish. They dart in and out of the tower of coral, hiding in the shadows and zooming through the blue light, oblivious to faces pressed against the glass watching them swim. The new Taurus moon tells all Pisces to trust their inner voice, to let the past go and look toward a clear future. All of which is ridiculous because what kind of lunatic actually believes in horoscopes -- and yet the fish tank.\n\nThis is an odd and important time to drop into Pogba's world, which is exactly as weird and singular as you'd want it to be. The last Premier League season, which ended two days ago, exposed clearly the conflict that will dominate the rest of his career: Can the joy and whimsy that define his play survive the pressures seeking to harden him into something serious and mathematical? If Pogba succumbs to Mourinho's system, he might become the best player of his generation. Or he might lose the most important part of himself and his game. \"It has to be fun,\" Pogba says. \"It started like that. It started fun. So why does it have to change?\"\n\nFriends describe him as one of the happiest people they've ever met, a trait he inherited from his mother, who looks on every good thing in her life as a blessing to be celebrated. The people closest to him believe his joy serves as a kind of pilot light for his talent. Two of those people stood in their kitchen two days ago, on the morning of Man United's final league game, and remembered Pogba saying years ago, \"I'll play football wherever it makes me feel happy.\"\n\nPaul and Carol Dalby served as Pogba's host family when he first came to England as a teenager to attend the Man United academy. He spent three years there before joining Juventus in 2012. They remember the drama of his departure, after he fell out of favor with Sir Alex Ferguson and was allowed to leave for nothing. Pogba confided in the Dalbys at the time, \"I like them, but they don't seem to like me.\" When he signed with Juventus, they knew before nearly anyone in the world, and when Pogba struggled to deal with the aggressive Italian fans -- one time in Turin, a Juve fan got into the passenger seat of his car at a red light to take a selfie -- he'd talk to them about it. Once when Juve came to play Man City, Pogba asked the Dalbys to visit him at the team hotel. Sitting in the second-floor restaurant overlooking the river in the old textile mill town, he shared his frustrations.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" they asked. \"You don't seem too happy at Juventus.\"\n\nESPN FC: World Cup 2018\n\nComplete coverage, schedule, previews\n\nWorld Cup 2018 previews for all 32 teams\n\nPlay ESPN FC's Match Predictor!\n\nWhen he left Italy, he returned to a feeling as much as a geographical location, something deeper and more personal than chasing dollars and prestige. It seems strange that he should be searching for something most observers think he's already found. He makes millions a year playing a game -- and yet that seems to be the central question. Is it still a game? Grown men have been fighting one another in court and in public over his talent since he was a boy. His second agent and his first engaged in a yearslong dispute over the first contract Pogba signed, a predatory deal in which he relinquished the rights to his own name and likeness. He tries not to let messy international commerce dampen his enthusiasm. That gets harder with each passing season.\n\nIt's been especially hard during this season that just ended.\n\nOn the morning of United's final league game, the Dalbys thought about the difficulty of watching a young man they consider an adopted son be trashed day after day. They've bristled at how easily critics, even former United players who should know better, engage so guiltlessly in a market in which players are characters and not former 16-year-old boys a long way from home, asking Carol and Paul for seconds of pasta.\n\n\"It's so cruel, you know?\" Carol says. \"It's so cruel. He's just been battered.\"\n\nThat day found them writing the obituary and eulogy for Paul Dalby's brother, who died suddenly while on vacation in Spain. When Pogba heard the news, he reached out. When he scored in a United game a few days later, he sent the Dalbys a note saying that the goal was a gift for their grieving family and that he'd be delivering the shirt he wore while scoring. He stops by whenever he can -- not long ago, he and Zulay showed up for a visit wearing matching bright-red Adidas tracksuits. The Dalbys could only smile and shake their heads. That's the Pogba they've always known. They remember him rushing to the fridge in the morning to find the word of the day, which he'd use in conversation. Even when Pogba got a flat in Manchester, he would still spend lots of time with his \"second family,\" as he's written on some signed shirts they keep. They made sure he didn't live on just Chinese takeout.\n\nPogba is family to them. He bounded around their home with the same youthful enthusiasm that he took to the pitch, where he'd bounce before games, smiling and joking with teammates and opponents alike. He found the purest expression of his inner self on the field. At least he once did. \"He used to prance around the pitch,\" Paul Dalby says. \"A little bit of that has left him now.\"\n\nThey can take one look at him and know how he's doing. Earlier this year, Carol walked through the room where their big television played the United game. Paul grew up watching Bobby Charlton and George Best and loves to see his local club play. Almost accidentally, Carol caught a glimpse of Pogba on the pitch.\n\n\"He doesn't look very happy,\" she said.\n\n\"He's not,\" he said.\n\nPogba is standing in the long, narrow hallway that runs from the kitchen to his garage. The lion and fake-diamond stairs are almost directly behind him. The fish zoom and dart in the blue light. Hanging from his neck is a pendant with a man's face on it.\n\n\"That's my dad,\" he says.\n\nFassou Antoine Pogba -- Pogdaddy on his youngest son's social media -- is on Paul's mind. He died a year ago yesterday in a Manchester hospital at the age of 79. Fassou began life in a jungle village in remote Guinea and ended it receiving the full weight and support of Manchester United, thanks to his wealthy and devoted son.\n\nHe always told his son exactly what he thought, face-to-face, blunt and real.\n\n\"The only way to be No. 1 is to have pillars in your life who help you and protect you,\" says Magassa, Pogba's former coach. \"You can't be the best if you're alone.\"\n\nDuring the toughest year of Pogba's career, when he most needed straight talk, there's been nobody to give it. He feels his father's loss acutely and has shouldered this grief almost entirely in private. The football-viewing world got a glimpse of what he's been feeling during a March friendly between France and Russia: Pogba lifted his jersey to reveal a homemade white T-shirt with a written message of remembrance and love to his late father. Perhaps it's a coincidence, but in that game, Pogba played with the kind of magic and creativity that has made him among the most sought-after and frustrating players of his generation. He scored a goal and recorded an assist, and with the exception of his two-goal performance against Man City looked quite different from the player Man United fans have watched this past year. When Pogba plays for Didier Deschamps' France, he dances and floats around the pitch. For Mourinho's United, he looks paralyzed from overthinking. With Juventus, he shared a five-man midfield with dominant players such as Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and Claudio Marchisio, and his 6-foot-3 frame gave him an advantage against most of his smaller counterparts. With United, he plays with just one other true midfielder and must shoulder a greater offensive load in the more physically demanding Premier League. His role with France more closely mirrors his role at Juventus than at Man United.\n\nSome of the difference, then, is clearly tactical, but it's also deeper than that. Both Deschamps and Mourinho play counter-attack football, so this goes beyond a player flourishing in a specific style. The difference is within Pogba himself. He seems to feel something about himself and his game -- a soaring Pogmood! -- when he is playing for his country. He's got that prance the Dalbys noticed all those years ago.\n\nWhen he takes the pitch this summer, his pregame prayer will include his dad. Fassou wanted to play football as a child in Africa, but his own father told him he needed to forget such childish things. Pogba's coaches remember Fassou as a serious, intellectual man who wanted his son to have a better life. He demanded good grades before Paul was allowed near a ball. Pogba's joy on the field is both an act of rebellion against his father -- the exuberant, free son of a grinding immigrant father -- and a way to live out the dreams his father was never allowed to chase.\n\nNow Pogba is 25, and his father has been gone a year and a day.\n\nRafaela, his multilingual Brazilian manager, is often telling him to soak up every part of the ride. She's been in this business a long time now and knows how quickly a 25-year-old phenom becomes a 35-year-old has-been. \"This doesn't last forever,\" she says. \"This is such a short experience. You have to live it and enjoy it and have fun.\"\n\nHe is trying to live that advice while playing for a manager who believes matches are won by strangulation and not wild abandon. Every now and then, like in that dominating performance against Man City, a glimmer of what Pogba might become breaks through for a moment. Someday he'll be fully realized, right? The first part of that answer will come in Russia. There are many things to be decided; summer will bring rumors of a transfer to PSG or Real Madrid, or even a possible return to Juventus, something in him forever wistful and chasing. Either of those would be oddly predictable -- another return to a happier place, another do-over. \"In football,\" he says, \"you're not allowed to make mistakes.\"\n\nTuesday is nearly over for him. All day he's been subdued, redoing his schedule in his head and doing the four media interviews his team set up for him. Watching him has been like feeling an engine bumping up against an electronic governor, never really letting go, forced into a high, revving idle. He's been mostly quiet -- until he's on a video chat to wish his friend (and former France captain) Patrice Evra a happy birthday. This is the first and only glimpse of the actual Pogba, the one the Dalbys met and the one Zulay loves and the one who makes managers go gooey when he channels his talent.\n\nHe is screaming into the camera as loud as he can.\n\nHe is dancing and making cat noises.\n\n\"I look nice just for your birthday!\" he crows.\n\n\"Oui!\" he yells, pronouncing it \"whey.\"\n\nPogba isn't turning anything on. This is the him that's always trying to get out, the one his friends and family want to protect from the public grind of his job. Sometimes, when you drop in on the biggest stars on the biggest stages, you see nothing real. Most of the time, honestly. But every now and again, you catch a glimpse of someone moving at breakneck speed toward a true crossroads, as Pogba's friend and former coach said. You see a man choosing a path. Pogba talks about playing Barcelona and being close enough to Iniesta to understand his genius or what he learned by sharing the field with Paul Scholes. He dreams of being one of those men. But he's also rich and famous, and maybe that's enough.\n\n\u0093It has to be fun. It started like that. Why does it have to change?\u0094\n\n- Paul Pogba\n\nWhatever the path, his future is being written in real time.\n\nSitting in a chair in his billiards room on Tuesday, he feels legitimately hopeful about winning the FA Cup and salvaging the team's season. A trophy might redeem them all. He couldn't know the future then. He didn't know they'd go down to London and lose or that he'd miss a wide-open header in the 82nd minute. Chelsea didn't even mark him, and he still didn't get the ball on frame. At its most simple, his entire world -- from the PogMondrian Poghouse to the PogWAG to the Pogchef -- is designed to keep information like that safely on the other side of the hedges and gate.\n\nHe's trying to remain positive and upbeat; during a 20-minute interview just before his photo shoot, he repeatedly avoids easy chances to dig into Mourinho. His manager actually seems a little disappointed that he didn't take any shots; she says she told him that the story wouldn't come out until after the FA Cup final and that he should feel free to speak his mind. The closest he comes is when he's asked what he thinks Man United needs to do most urgently. \"We all think about the old Manchester United, the Ferguson United,\" he says. \"I think it's time for people to realize that time passed. He won't come back. You have to look ahead. Now we have to think about the future. We have to find the next Ferguson.\"\n\nHe stands in the indoor football pitch and looks tough for the camera.\n\nZulay looks at his expression on a monitor and laughs.\n\n\"He always makes that face,\" she says.\n\nEveryone shakes goodbye. The stylists and Adidas people navigate Pogba trying to take home all the clothes they brought for the shoot. Pogba heads upstairs to start packing for London. It never ends when you're 25 and making your reputation, not in boardrooms or meetings but on football fields around the world, every action and reaction dissected. Change happens fast. His manager says the Poghouse could be stripped and turned into a Poglesshouse in a matter of days should he ever need to sell. Even this football pitch where he's standing can be returned to a pool with a little work. She points at the walls that would have to come out, breaks it down step-by-step.\n\nPogba heads off toward the staircase, past his fish and his lion and his stairs filled with the fake diamonds.

    "raw_text": "This story appears in ESPN The Magazine's May 7 Mayhem issue. Subscribe!\n\nCotton-thick snow flutters from an endless white ceiling, choking downtown Cleveland on this mid-January night. On steeper terrain, snow can turn sinister, transforming into a screaming wall of white that buries anything in its path. The NBA's most destructive force acts in similar fashion. Inside Quicken Loans Arena, it has lain dormant for three quarters, and now in the fourth, with the score tied at 93, it arrives slowly, subtly, like a snowflake falling from the sky.\n\nIt begins like this: Cavs guard Dwyane Wade misses a jumper, Warriors forward Draymond Green devours the rebound and rifles a length-of-the-court pass to teammate David West, who is fouled and sinks two free throws. Warriors guard Klay Thompson blocks a layup, Green collects the ball and feeds teammate Shaun Livingston, who races through the lane and lays it in. Four points, 20 seconds. Cavs players stare at the floor, their shoulders starting to sag. Coach Tyronn Lue calls timeout.\n\nAfter the break, Cleveland misses twice more, then Thompson drills a turnaround baseline jumper. The Cavs score, West counters with a driving dunk. Another Cavs layup is blocked, then they miss again and are blocked again, then miss twice more before Livingston nails an uncontested one-handed floater on the other end. LeBron James shakes his head.\n\nAssistant coach Mike Longabardi, the Cavs' defensive coordinator, drops his hands in despair. A sellout crowd of 20,562, once electric for this matchup between Finals foes, falls quiet. Lue calls timeout again, his team having scored two points in the past 5\u00bd minutes, having missed 14 of its past 15 field goals. Kevin Durant springs off the Warriors' bench to celebrate with teammates. Coach Steve Kerr balls his hand into a fist.\n\nAfter the second break, Green makes a wide-open layup after a laser pass from Livingston, and now -- in just 3 minutes, 23 seconds -- the Cavs trail by 10. They continue to splinter. James misses a free throw, his teammate Isaiah Thomas turns it over, two Cavs draw personal fouls, then James hurls a dreadful pass toward the corner that Nick Young steals -- before burying a corner 3 right in front of Cleveland's bench.\n\nBefore this game, Lue had warned, \"They're the only team that you look at the game and it's a two-point game, and then you go to the bathroom, come back out and they're up 15.\" And now, exactly that has happened. In a span of 5 minutes and 36 seconds, the time it takes for that bathroom pit stop, his team has been hurled into a 14-point deficit. And now the Cavs players droop onto the bench. And now the Cavs fans begin to leave. And now Durant is waving his arms like a boxing referee stopping a fight.\n\nOver the past four years in the NBA, if there's been an abiding certainty, it's this: At some point in most every Warriors game-and far more often than with any other team in the league-Golden State will reach to the side of its controller and press a turbo button that seemingly only it possesses.\n\nWhen it happens, as it will throughout these playoffs, it is swift and efficient -- and devastating. \"Whenever we play against them, we're excited and scared at the same time,\" says Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo four days before the Warriors buried the Cavs, \"because we know that at any point in the game, they can embarrass us.\"\n\nThe facts: In the four regular seasons since Kerr became the Warriors' coach in 2014, his club has gone on 10-0 runs 253 times, the most in the NBA. The Warriors' record in such games is 165-20, meaning they win these games at about the same rate that Stephen Curry hits his free throws. In the same span, they've dropped 27 devastating 15-0 runs, also tops in the league, to the tune of 25 wins and two losses.\n\nThe Warriors will tell you that they don't always know when it will happen, cannot always sense the start of an avalanche. But it has happened enough that the team believes, just as its foes do, that one will arrive at some point.\n\nIt happens in the first quarter, when the Warriors have reeled off 74 runs of 10 or more unanswered points over the past four seasons, and in the third (70), the second (66) and fourth quarters (43) too. It happens when the game is close, with 82 runs when the score is within one possession. It has happened 116 times in the past four years when they were behind and 125 times when they were ahead -- again, the most in the NBA.\n\nIt happens when they're way ahead too -- they've racked up 21 10-0 runs when they're already up by 15 or more. And this, the burning of an already-sacked village, is a thing they especially love to do to the Cavaliers. In the past four seasons, the Warriors have three times gone on 10-0 runs against the Cavs when up by 15. On Jan. 16, 2017, they did it twice in one game.\n\nIf you're an opposing coach, or opposing player, you'll surely look for the patterns in the Warriors' runs. And you will find them. But then you'll find others, and others still. Eventually you'll find so many patterns that you'll succumb to the scariest notion: There is no pattern at all.\n\nHey, guys, you gotta stay focused. You ... gotta ... stay ... focused. And you can't let them have the runs.\" It's Dec. 4, 2017, and Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry is preaching to his players what he always preaches before facing the Warriors. He says it before tonight's matchup in New Orleans and then again at halftime, with his team ahead 69-49.\n\n\"You fear it,\" Gentry says now. \"You turn it over, they hit a 3. You come back down, you take a good shot, but it doesn't go in. They come back down and now they hit a layup. And now you come back down again, you throw it inside, you miss an easy basket; they get a 3 and you're saying, 'God, we just need good shots.' And you look up, you're down nine.\"\n\nIndeed, on this night, the Warriors open the third quarter on a 15-0 run -- Gentry's fears realized in 3 minutes, 47 seconds -- outscoring the Pelicans 39-22 in the frame on their way to a 125-115 win. It would mark the third game of the season in which the Pelicans had a double-digit lead over the Warriors only to lose.\n\nWhat can you do? Gentry pauses and begins telling the story of Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals, the Warriors hosting the Spurs -- the mighty, unshakable Spurs. San Antonio goes up by 25 points. And though Spurs star Kawhi Leonard is lost to an ankle injury in the third quarter, the Spurs are still the Spurs. If anyone can hold on, it's them. Yet as Gentry watches the lead slowly wither alongside 17-year-old son Jack from their home in New Orleans' Lower Garden District neighborhood, a familiar dread overtakes him. \"I don't know if San Antonio's going to be able to stop it,\" he tells his son.\n\n\"No, no,\" Jack replies. \"All they gotta do is get a basket. A couple of baskets here and there and everything is back to normal.\"\n\n\"No,\" Gentry says. \"You don't understand.\"\n\nSure enough, the Warriors, on the strength of an 18-0 second-half run, come back to win 113-111 -- and sweep the Spurs.\n\nGentry understands this all too well. Over the past four regular seasons, the Warriors have gone on 10-0 runs against four teams 14 times, their most against any team. Those teams are the Rockets, Kings, Lakers and ... Pelicans. To Gentry, this thing is personal. When these runs arrive, part of his job is to keep his players from sliding into a mental abyss. But what can he say? What can they do? Take Halloween 2015 in New Orleans, when Curry scored 53 points, including outscoring the Pelicans by himself, 28 to 26, in the third quarter as the Warriors turned a close game into a blowout win.\n\nIn that game, Pelicans guard Toney Douglas was guarding Curry on three consecutive possessions. \"He's doing a great job, not a good job, a great job,\" Gentry said. But Curry was volcanic and at one point sank three 3-pointers in 92 seconds over Douglas, who turned to Gentry on the sideline with a look that said \"What am I supposed to do?\"\n\n\"You're not supposed to do anything,\" Gentry told Douglas. \"You can't. Just roll with it, OK?\"\n\n\"But Coach,\" Douglas told Gentry, \"I'm right there.\"\n\nPity the Pelicans, whom the Warriors ambush often ... but they turned downright cruel during the recent conference semifinals matchup. In the five-game series, the Warriors crushed the Pelicans with seven different 10-0 runs -- with two each coming in Games 1, 2 and 5. And in Games 1 and 5, the Warriors' two 10-0 runs happened in the same quarter.\n\nThe Pelicans aren't the only squad on the wrong end of these playoff blitzes. Entering their tantalizing conference finals showdown with the Rockets, the Warriors have unleashed 49 different 10-0 runs in the four postseasons under Kerr, the second most of any team in that span behind the Cavs' 51.\n\nAs for Gentry, well, he tried his best to stop the spate of onslaughts, burning through three timeouts in the second quarter of Game 1 and then four of them in the third quarter in Game 5 -- all potential tourniquets to stop his squad from bleeding out. But alas, when it was over, he sat at the postgame news conference table in the bowels of Oracle Arena, wearing a helpless grin.\n\nAs he rose to walk away and into the offseason, Gentry leaned back down toward the microphone. He had one last thing to say -- the same phrase former Lakers guard Nick Van Exel used to break the team huddle when his overmatched squad was being crushed by a superior playoff foe in 1999, a phrase that admitted defeat but also looked ahead to better days, sunny skies and sandy beaches.\n\nGentry smiled, then recited Van Exel's now-famous words.\n\n\"1-2-3 ... Cancun.\"\n\nWhat can anyone do? Well, there is one thing. We know it because we've seen it tried, again and again, especially by Gentry as his team was being buried: Try to find the pause button for the horror movie -- and call a timeout. Who employs it the most? Swears by it the strongest? Many Warriors answer quickly: \"Carlisle.\" That would be Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, who defends his propensity to call early timeouts by arguing that the first quarter is almighty, a holy harbinger of everything to follow.\n\n\"It's such an undervalued statistic in our league,\" Carlisle says with a touch of bewilderment -- one that few others acknowledge what he considers to be mathematical law. The statistic is this: Teams that led after the first quarter were 67 percent more likely to have a lead going into the fourth this past regular season, and those that had a lead going into the fourth were 82 percent more likely to emerge victorious.\n\n\"If you get hit by big runs early in the first quarter, you've got to be willing to take two timeouts in the first quarter, because it's a first-quarter game,\" he says.\n\nConsider a Jan. 3 matchup in Dallas. The Mavericks lead 14-13 in the first quarter. But then Curry drills a step-back jumper, which is followed by a pair of Jordan Bell free throws, then a Durant driving floater -- all in a span of 44 seconds. Carlisle calls time. After a 6-2 run to open the second, Carlisle calls time again. After a 7-0 run just before halftime? Carlisle calls time. After two straight Draymond Green buckets in the third? Carlisle, you guessed it, calls time.\n\n\"Certain coaches, you realize their whole goal is to use their timeouts to break that run up,\" Green says later. \"Sometimes it'll break the run up, but it's more enjoyable when they try to break it up and we come and score eight straight out of the timeout.\"\n\nDoes it work?\n\nOn Nov. 18, 2016, Celtics coach Brad Stevens called two timeouts to try to stop an 18-0 run. Didn't work. On Nov. 4, 2017, Denver coach Mike Malone called two timeouts, then benched all five players on the court to try to stop a 24-4 run. Same. On Feb. 15, 2017, Kings coach Dave Joerger used three timeouts to try to stop a 26-2 run. A lot of good that did him. \"It gives us a nice little break, actually,\" Klay Thompson says.\n\n\u0093What makes us dangerous is that it can happen at any time.\u0094\n\n- Steph Curry\n\nIn fact, in 25 of the 27 games in which the Warriors have gone on a 15-0 run since 2014-15, their opponents used a timeout -- on average, opponents called 1.44 timeouts during those Warriors runs -- and every time Curry ignited such a run, the opponents called a timeout. But in the 25 games in which the Warriors went on a 15-0 run and their opponent called their first timeout, the Warriors' run continued each time. In short, that first timeout means nothing -- and calling a second or a third doesn't do much to help either. \"Yeah, it doesn't do anything, really,\" Curry says. \"Once a couple of shots go down, our confidence goes through the roof, so a timeout doesn't bother it.\"\n\nAnd so it is that at the end of this game, after Mavericks forward Harrison Barnes ties the score at 122 on a driving layup with 12 seconds left, Carlisle might well have wanted to call a timeout to set up his defense, to come up with a scheme for a game-saving stop. But he can't. He doesn't have one. He used them all up trying to stave off these runs.\n\nHe can only stand there in those final seconds, shouting instructions from the sideline while watching the Warriors inbound the ball to Curry. The Warriors MVP calmly dribbles the ball upcourt, receives a screen from Green and curls off it, finding himself wide open at the top of the key. Dirk Nowitzki is nearby but not close enough, and Carlisle helplessly watches Curry take aim with three seconds left and ... well, what can you do?\n\nCurry smiles looking back, considering his warning and how it played out for Carlisle and the Mavericks on that final play. \"Hopefully,\" Curry says, still smiling, \"we'll get you either way.\"\n\nKevin Durant is sitting off to the side of a Chicago court after a morning shootaround in mid-January, hours before he and his teammates will force the Bulls to, in the words of Chicago coach Fred Hoiberg, \"lose their minds.\" Durant is almost giddy, describing how when teams scramble to respond to the Warriors' ball movement and collapse on a guy like Zaza Pachulia, a guy like Pachulia can feed wide-open teammates for an easy bucket.\n\n\"Everybody is touching the ball, so everybody is feeling it. It's good,\" he says. \"And Coach is clapping on the sideline. Everybody on the team is clapping. It's just good energy.\"\n\nIt's also damn effective. Since Kerr took over, the Warriors have led the league with 38,958 possessions with at least five frontcourt passes -- 2,066 more than second-place Cleveland. They score 1.13 points per possession on those, which also leads the league. Which is to say, when everyone on the Warriors is touching the ball, they're lethal. \"You've got guys that are just simmering,\" Durant says. \"Steph is simmering when he don't got the ball. Klay is simmering. Everybody is just simmering.\"\n\nTrying to diagnose the why of how it starts leads to a chicken-or-egg dilemma. Do the stops lead to the runs, or do the runs lead to the stops? But what is true, by and large, is that the Warriors believe it's the former. That's why Kerr preaches three stops, three stops, three stops, trusting that if his team strings together three in a row, it can lead to three straight 3-pointers. \"Three possessions is the difference between a close game and a blowout,\" Curry says. \"That's what makes us dangerous -- that it can happen at any time.\"\n\nAsk Curry and he'll tell you that some runs are the product of the Warriors' wearing teams down for 48 minutes, water rising until the dam bursts. When the Warriors start a possession after a live-ball turnover or defensive rebound, they average 1.18 points per possession, tops in the league. But there are also quick-strike runs -- we'll call them \"bursts\" -- 30-second runs that skyrocket a team's chances to win, and the Warriors are the masters of these. A \"knockout\" occurs when a team has a greater than 90 percent chance to win a game at the end of a burst, and the Warriors are the masters of these as well.\n\nIn fact, over the past four seasons, the Warriors have 37 third-quarter knockouts, best in the league. And once the Warriors land a knockout, their opponent feels the effects. During these, the Warriors' opponents move at an average on-court speed of 4.8 mph, but once the Warriors land the knockout, they slow down by over 10 percent, averaging just 4.2 mph.\n\nKerr, for his part, preaches singles, not home runs -- make the simple, routine play -- and after a few of those? \"That's when the home run hits,\" Thompson says. \"A backdoor dunk for somebody or a pull-up 3 or a heat-check from Steph.\"\n\nThen here, the Warriors say, is when teams start becoming frenetic. \"Teams start thinking about so many things out there because of our movement, and that's how we go on runs,\" Durant says. \"It's not the 3s that kill teams. Because we don't make all our shots from the 3-point line. It's the movement and the body movement and the ball movement, boom, we drop off to Zaza, he hits a layup. That's what will crush a team.\"\n\nWhat starts as a spark becomes an inferno -- the Warriors hitting 3-pointers, defenses spreading out to cover the perimeter more to try to stop this gusher, the Warriors in turn slashing, moving, shifting, cutting backdoor.\n\nThe scoreboard lights up like a slot machine at jackpot. \"Then they're thinking about defense when they're on offense and we're applying pressure,\" Warriors swingman Andre Iguodala says. Teams buckle like a bridge carrying too much weight. The Warriors first sense a shift in body language, say, after a big shot, with opposing players looking at their bench, helpless, throwing their hands up. As then-Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said in January 2015, after enduring a 15-0 second-quarter run that helped lead to a 122-79 loss: \"We looked like we were scared.\"\n\nOften, it's as simple as the other team fraying from the fear of such a run -- of being so mentally taxed by staying so intensely focused for so long that eventually the players' focus slips. Maybe they make a poor decision. Perhaps it's a bad shot on offense or a turnover. \"That's what is tough about the NBA -- to focus every possession,\" Durant says. \"That's hard as s--- to do. It's not the physical part. It's not making 3s. It's not how many sets can we run, how many dunks can we get. It's about staying focused every play.\"\n\nIf they're home, where they've gone on 142 10-0 runs, the Warriors and their bench are going wild; their crowd too. On the road, where they've gone on 111 runs? They savor the silence. \"To silence Cleveland is spectacular because it's so f---ing loud in there,\" Green says. They can see it on the sideline, players losing confidence. They see opposing players looking at each other, saying, \"Hey, man. We're in this, we're in this, we are good.\"\n\n\"But you can tell sometimes that they don't even believe it,\" Green says. \"You can definitely feel teams quit.\"\n\nBack in college, at Davidson in North Carolina, Steph Curry took part in a drill called Bolts of Lightning, a 55-second period during which all the players would launch 3-pointers. They did so because their coach, Bob McKillop, believed that 3-pointers, like lightning, cause opponents to run for cover. What, after all, can you do about lightning? So during games, if Davidson would make a 3-pointer, then on the very next possession its first look would be to make another, then repeat on the next possession -- with the goal of getting three in a row, potentially a 9-0 run.\n\nMcKillop devised another strategy called Daggers, whereby any time the Wildcats recorded an offensive rebound, that player would first look to the arc to feed a teammate for a trey. They noticed that a team could defend well for 30 seconds but then give up a 3-pointer and become deflated. They also noticed how much Curry enjoyed those shots.\n\n\"He has a relentless appetite for putting a dagger in people,\" McKillop says. \"He found great joy in winning but particular great joy when one shot, one play, could just completely demoralize somebody.\"\n\nYears later, Warriors assistant coach Bruce Fraser can watch Curry bring the ball upcourt and know exactly what will happen next -- Curry will be a little lower, almost crouched, with a certain focus in his eyes, everything heightened about his disposition. \"It's like a lion on a hunt,\" Fraser says.\n\nAs for Kerr? \"It's like an animal sensing that there's some prey and it's time to eat,\" he says. \"It's like a primal force. It's time to pounce. Steph senses it as well as anybody I've ever seen.\"\n\nThe only other person who comes close, in Kerr's eyes? Larry Bird. For as much as the coldblooded Celtics legend is known as a 3-point sniper, he didn't shoot that many -- his season high in attempts was just 3.3 per game. \"But back in the day,\" Kerr points out, \"Bird would purposely shoot 3s in those situations because he sensed that same fear of the opponent and he'd go for the jugular, and that's what Steph does.\"\n\nHere is how Draymond Green knows it's coming. Green will set a screen, then he'll roll toward the basket and be open. And nine times out of 10, Curry will pass him the ball. But not this time. This time, when Green sets the pick and rolls to the hoop and is open, Curry won't even look at him.\n\nSo Green will, in his words, \"get the f--- out of the way.\"\n\nHe'll stand near the hoop, maybe, and just watch, like a fan. It's at this point, usually, when his teammate is one-on-one with a defender near the top of the key, that he'll begin dancing, as Durant says, and that is Durant's cue. \"When that first person starts dancing at the party,\" Durant says, \"you can tell the party is about to ramp up.\"\n\nCurry is crossing it over, left to right, back again, behind his back, through his legs, he and the ball becoming one, a string of actions that unfold so fast they fold into one another. His defender will try to deny the game's most lethal shooter a sliver of distance, but -- what can you do? -- eventually, those carefully orchestrated dribbles will leave the defender off balance.\n\nCurry hunts for these moments when an opponent is staggering. \"We call it a dagger shot,\" he says. So after dancing for a moment to earn whatever distance he needs, which isn't much, Curry will fire from distances unfathomable to all but him -- and there is a reason he takes such deep shots in such moments.\n\n\"It's the one that takes the energy, it's the one that takes the heart,\" Green says. \"And you look, and all of them are just like, 'Oh my god ... this is crazy.'\"\n\n\"If he pulls up for a deep 3, that's him saying, 'All right, I'm trying to get this s--- over with,'\" Durant says. \"He's trying to knock you out. He's trying to end you. That's what killers do. That's what mentally strong people do -- like psychopaths.\n\n\"Steph,\" Durant adds, \"wants to stab you in the heart.\"\n\nRelay all this to Curry and he laughs. He gets this all the time. He's had this mentality since college, he says. He knows that when the avalanche comes, there's nothing they can do. And he knows, more than most, that the best part of a run is the shot that ends it.\n\n\"And I can do it,\" he says, \"with a smile on my face.\"\n\nResearch contributed by ESPN Stats & Information's Vincent Johnson\n\nBaxter HolmesHolmes is a staff writer for ESPN.",

He'll team up with music producer Marshmello against NBA stars Paul George and Andre Drummond and actor Joel McHale.\n\nIn his room at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons, already dressed in jeans and a purple jersey featuring his logo of a masked warrior, he lets his signature shock of dyed hair -- blue today! -- dry before styling it. All the while, he's trying not to get irritated at the things first-class accommodations cannot accommodate: \"I lost 15,000 subs yesterday,\" he says. Even though he's headlining today's celebrity event, because he's not livestreaming on Twitch, he's losing subscribers -- 40,000 of them, to be exact, by the end of the two days he'll spend in LA. And that means he could lose money in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Ninja, ask the nearest 12-year-old. He shot to fame in March after he and Drake played Fortnite, the video game phenomenon in which 100 players are dropped onto an island and battle to be the last one standing while building forts that are used to both attack and hide from opponents. At its peak, Ninja and Drake's game, which also featured rapper Travis Scott and Pittsburgh Steelers receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, pulled in 630,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch, Amazon's livestreaming platform, shattering the previous record of 388,000. Since then, Ninja has achieved what no other gamer has before: mainstream fame. With 11 million Twitch followers and climbing, he commands an audience few can dream of. In April, he logged the most social media interactions in the entire sports world, beating out the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Shaquille O'Neal and Neymar.\n\nEvery day, people tune in by the hundreds of thousands to watch him play, and he's making bank doing it. The most commonly reported figure is $500,000 a month. Blevins suggests the number is closer to seven figures. Twitch, which now boasts 2.2 million streamers around the world, gives its content creators three ways of generating revenue. Like traditional TV, there are ads, and streamers make money based on how many people watch those ads. Like Netflix, there are also subscriptions, though you don't have to subscribe to watch. And finally, like street busking, there are donations. (The largest donation Blevins can remember receiving is $40,000.) Off subscriptions alone, Blevins makes an estimated $300,000 a month. That's not factoring in his sponsorships, which include Samsung, Red Bull and Uber Eats, or the revenue from YouTube, Instagram and other sites.\n\nBlevins compares himself to the owner of a small business, and the only product is Ninja. He weighs every decision to leave his computer -- to travel to a celebrity-heavy event like the Pro-Am in Los Angeles or even to visit family -- against the financial repercussions. \"When we decide whether I'm going to an event, the pay has to be there,\" he says. \"If it's not paid, how much clout are you going to get? Are you going to be networking? Is that networking worth $70,000?\" At the same time, there's the constant threat of fading popularity. \"The more breaks [streamers] take,\" he says, \"the less they stream, the less they're relevant.\"\n\nOnce inside LAFC's sparkling downtown stadium, where the 100 competitors sit in neat rows dwarfed by a giant screen, things initially don't go Ninja's way. He dies early in the warm-up round, to the disbelief of the sold-out crowd of teens, 20-somethings and parents. When competitive play begins, their faith is restored: Ninja eliminates fellow streamer Jack \"CouRage\" Dunlop to win the tournament. Ninja jumps out of his chair and swings his outstretched arms back and forth in the goofy \"pon-pon\" dance he does almost daily on his stream (it's like his version of the dab). He bounces toward Marshmello with a huge grin on his face and engulfs him in a hug before the two pose for photos with their Golden Pickaxe trophies. Ninja swings his at the ground like he's digging for gold.\n\nDESPITE HIS SUCCESS as one of the top Fortnite players in the world -- he was second in all-time wins as of Sept. 12 -- Ninja is constantly worried that he's peaked. The stress gnaws at him. \"When I'm not streaming, I have time to reflect on all the growth, and I don't like that. I'd rather just be home playing,\" he says. \"I'm like, 'I haven't played a celebrity in a while. I haven't done something big in a while. Is it because I'm slowing down?' When I'm home, there's no time to think about that.\"\n\nHome is a gated community about an hour outside Chicago. The Blevinses moved to the area in May to escape the people showing up daily at their previous house in suburban Chicago seeking selfies. Now, in a neighborhood where several Bears players live, they still get some unsolicited visitors, kids who leave letters in the mailbox and fans who just come to ogle. When I pull up to the security booth, I ask the 30-something guard if he knows who Tyler Blevins is. He points at his laptop; he's watching Ninja's stream.\n\nJess greets today's guests -- TV producers, photographers and me, among others -- at the door of their million-dollar home with the couple's Yorkshire terriers, Chance and Na'vi (yes, like in Avatar). As she shows us around, we hear a primal victory scream from downstairs, and a few of us glance around in confusion. Jess hardly blinks.\n\nTyler can't join us until he wraps up his six-hour stream. In the basement, past a well-stocked bar, a pool table and a dartboard, next to a foosball table, he sits on this sunny August day in a T-shirt and plaid pajama pants at the most famous space in their house, his gaming setup. It doesn't look like much -- a couple of screens, a fridge full of Red Bull, a mess of wires -- but from this modest corner he makes millions by captivating millions.\n\nUnlike tournaments, where gamers vie for wins and prize pools, streaming is as much about entertainment as it is about victory. Streamers like Ninja transform their lives into content, broadcasting their thoughts and doings in real time. Watch a streamer long enough and he feels like your friend. During one recent stream, Ninja coos at one of his dogs in a high-pitched baby voice in between games: \"Oh hi, my little ladybug. I love that you can come see me anytime because we don't have doors in the basement!\"\n\nIn a clip from early September, which garnered 5.2 million Instagram views in two days, Ninja launches himself off a ramp to take on a squad of three. Equipped with a single-shot hunting rifle, he knocks down one person at close range from midair, without aiming down the sights -- a highly unlikely move. He screams in delight before getting a routine second kill, then decides to try the crazy move again, flying through the air, sniping the last guy in the same fashion with the same weapon. That's like making back-to-back full-court baskets. In less than 20 seconds, he takes out an entire squad on his own, all while maneuvering his character and building ramps and cover. He can't believe it either and jumps up from his chair screaming.\n\n\"He thinks of things other people don't,\" says Jacob \"Hysteria\" Reiser, a Fortnite streamer who was teammates with Ninja when the two played competitive Halo. \"He always goes for the flashy plays, and he pulls them off more than anyone.\"\n\nEarlier this year, when his fame was still fresh, Blevins was excited to talk to me about his new experiences. The coolest perk of being rich and famous was being able to fly first-class everywhere, he said, and the first time he and Jess were mobbed by fans was at the movies a week after the Drake stream. A few months later, he tells me that he and Jess can hardly go out. \"Going to the mall, out to eat, to the movies -- those were our favorite things to do,\" says Jess, 26. \"Now if we go out, it's just a nonstop picture-fest. We don't have that much time together, so we're not out very much.\"\n\nAbout two hours after our arrival at his home, Tyler emerges from the basement in his pajamas. He snuggles Chance and looks to Jess, who is also his manager, for his marching orders. She tells him to change and get his hair done for the photo shoot and that tomorrow he needs to clean the basement, which is littered with the detritus of having his old Halo pals over to game.\n\nWe're interrupting Jess and Tyler's daily routine. They typically spend half an hour together in the morning, then he streams, usually for about six hours while she takes business calls. They take a break around 4 p.m. before he gets back on the stream around 8 p.m. for another six hours. He goes offline one day a week, which they call a \"date day,\" though recently they've been skipping it because he's been so busy.\n\nTyler and Jess first met at a Halo tournament in December 2010. She didn't know much about gaming, but she did wonder whether she should ask him for a selfie in case he became famous one day. Years later, she messaged him through Twitter but thought he'd never reply because he had a whopping 1,000 followers. \"I thought that was so many at the time,\" she says, laughing. (He now has 3.29 million.) The couple got married last August and went on a six-day honeymoon in the Caribbean. Ninja left a message for his viewers explaining that he'd be gone and queued up videos so they'd have fresh content during his absence. It was his only vacation in eight years.\n\nIn college, Jess started streaming to better understand why Tyler would go hours without replying to her texts. A day in, she realized how consuming it was. \"It's physically exhausting but also mentally because you're sitting there constantly interacting,\" Tyler says. \"I'm engaging a lot more senses than if I were just gaming by myself. We're not sitting there doing nothing. I don't think anyone gets that.\"\n\nHe doesn't prepare jokes or lines to use in his streams, but he has absorbed so much from movies and TV and song lyrics that they float off his tongue. (Rick and Morty and SpongeBob are favorite sources for material.) But his improvisational style has led him astray. In March, he dropped the N-word while rapping on a stream. He apologized the next day and later announced he would stop swearing.\n\nNinja also has a knack for impersonating the more well-known gamers he teams up with on a stream. As a kid, he'd leave a movie theater reciting lines word for word in the actors' voices. He was so good at it, his parents tried to put him in theater. After telling me his favorite film is Interstellar, he drops a killer Matthew McConaughey impression.\n\nThe couple are aware of the pitfalls of working together, and Jess often has to make clear whether she's talking to Tyler as his wife or as his manager. When she herself is conflicted, they seek advice from his support team, which includes an agent, managers from Red Bull and Jess' mother. When I ask Jess for an example of a time they needed counsel, she says, \"Any of the controversial stuff.\"\n\nThe most contentious statement he's made to date came in August, when he told a Polygon reporter, \"I don't play with female gamers.\" His reasoning? Teaming up with women on stream might spark internet speculation, and he wants to protect his marriage. To some, his instinct was rather romantic, even noble. The internet is often a toxic place where anonymity frees people to unleash their worst selves. (When Tyler was still living with his parents, they once had their house surrounded by police, guns drawn, due to a swatting call.) But that toxicity is especially fierce against women, and esports is notoriously male-dominated. There is only one woman, South Korean Overwatch pro Geguri, playing on the biggest stages. Support from a man with Ninja's influence, especially among children, would go a long way toward overcoming barriers.\n\nWhen asked about the controversy now, Tyler talks even faster than he usually does and gets a little heated. He says he misspoke in that interview but reiterated his position. \"This is my spouse. This is the person I vowed to spend the rest of my life with,\" he says. \"The fact that anyone feels they can judge how I'm protecting my relationship and try to make it political ... really?\"\n\nHe says repeatedly he doesn't have a problem with women, only with trolls. The one-on-one stream especially, where two people game and talk for hours at a time, is \"very intimate in a way,\" and he would rather avoid doing that with a woman who isn't his wife. He does have plans to collaborate with popular women Instagrammers and says women gamers are always welcome to play with him in a group or at events. That way he can \"control the narrative more, without stupid drama and rumors flooding into our lives.\"\n\nFor her part, Jess says that Tyler can stream with whomever he wants and that she had no part in that decision, but she adds that rumors start about her all the time: \"My Instagram is flooded with ridiculous comments. I post a picture with our best friend or a brother-in-law and it's like, 'She cheated on you.'\"\n\nWhenever he has a free moment in the day, Tyler lies down on the couch next to Jess and the dogs. They complete each other's stories when together, and when they're apart, they tell a lot of the same ones. Tyler says the only time he doesn't feel like streaming is when Jess isn't home. \"I don't know what I'm streaming for,\" he says. \"I just want to lie there and do nothing and wait for her to come back.\"\n\nTHEIR HOUSE IS close to where Tyler grew up and not far from his two older brothers, Jonathan and Chris. The Blevins family moved to Illinois from Detroit when Tyler, whom the family calls Ty, was just a year old. (He hasn't forgotten his roots: A dedicated Lions fan, he watches Barry Sanders highlights to pump himself up.) Growing up, their dad, Chuck, was the gamer, playing on the Sega after his sons went to bed. The boys played too, though their mom, Cynthia, established some strict rules. They had to keep their grades up, get a job once they were old enough and, as Tyler remembers, spend an hour outside for every hour they gamed.\n\nTyler, who played soccer through high school, was the best at every video game he tried, to the point where Jonathan would punch him in the arm to try to stop him. \"He would drop his controller, then he'd still win,\" his brother remembers.\n\nTyler started calling himself Ninja after an old Halo move. He persuaded his parents to let him go to his first gaming tournament, in Columbus, Ohio, when he was 17 on the condition that his dad go with him. He and a rotating cast of teammates played and lived out of his parents' basement, to the point where Chuck and Cynthia started asking some of the guys to leave. He went pro in Halo and started streaming in his sophomore year of college, in 2011, after a year at Silver Lake College, a Catholic liberal arts school in Wisconsin. When he started making what he calls a \"comfortable living\" off streaming, he quit his job at Noodles & Company and dropped out of the community college he'd transferred to. When I ask what it took for him to feel comfortable, he estimates $80,000 to $90,000 a year.\n\nBlevins says he didn't know what streaming would become when he first started doing it, but he always had a knack for the next big thing. He got into both streaming and esports when Twitch was still called Justin.tv and tournaments were makeshift, low-budget events.\n\n\"He has the ability to see what he wants and not see the distractions,\" Cynthia says. \"There is something inside him that allows him to see success beyond what the normal person might see because he wants it.\"\n\nThat same savvy and willingness to take risks led him to see Fortnite's potential before anyone else. While all the big streamers were still playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Tyler noticed that the fans in his Twitch chat were talking about a new battle royale version of Fortnite that launched in September 2017. Sensing an opportunity, he switched to Fortnite last fall. He didn't realize the magnitude of what he'd done, he says: \"I don't think anyone thought it was possible to get this big through livestreaming.\"\n\nBACK AT NINJA'S house, we've moved to what he likes to call the Four Seasons room, a beautiful space fit for an afternoon tea party, with patio furniture and expansive windows looking out onto leafy trees and a manicured green. \"Just questions, right?\" Blevins asks me. \"As long as there's no video so I can just chill.\" He slumps on the couch, wrapping his long arms around himself. He closes his eyes to take in the glow of the sun, looking so peaceful that I hesitate to break the silence.\n\nHe's always on the lookout for the next big thing. He is so closely tied to Fortnite, it's hard to imagine his popularity surviving the jump, but he says he won't let that stop him. He's been so good for so long that he's confident he can master whatever comes next too. \"I can 100 percent compete at the top level in every game that I play,\" he says.\n\nThere will always be another game -- if not better, then simply newer. In fact, Ninja started streaming the beta version of Call of Duty's new battle royale, Blackout, on Friday to a peak of 271,000 viewers and announced on Saturday that he will be headlining a tournament for the new game at Twitch's annual streaming convention in late October.\n\nHow does he stay so good? Pro tip: Don't just play, practice. Ninja competes in about 50 games a day, and he analyzes each and every one. He never gets tired of it, and every loss hits him hard. Hypercompetitive, he makes sure he walks away with at least one win each day. (He averages about 15 and once got 29 in a single day.)\n\n\"When I die, I get so upset,\" he says. \"You can play every single day, you're not practicing. You die, and oh well, you go onto the next game. When you're practicing, you're taking every single match seriously, so you don't have an excuse when you die. You're like, 'I should have rotated here, I should have pushed there, I should have backed off.' A lot of people don't do that.\"\n\nStill, audiences are fickle, so Ninja won't give them an excuse to stop watching him. Despite his new wealth and fame and the demands on his time from sponsors, events and other deals -- including an official Team Ninja merchandise store launching in mid-September -- he does his best to feed the beast. \"So many people get content. So many people stop when they're at the top,\" he says, his voice growing fierce again. \"They'll let someone take their place because they're relaxing. That's not going to happen.\"\n\nBut what would he do if he could take a week off, no lost subscribers, no repercussions? \"What wouldn't we do?\" he says with a sigh. \"The first day, we'd do nothing. Just eat a bunch of junk food, watch TV, go to a movie, eat a bunch of popcorn and candy. The second day, we'd travel somewhere, anywhere. I heard Jamaica is wonderful. We would just sit there and drink pina coladas on the beach.\"\n\nWill he ever be able to do it? Surely none of this is worth it if he can't enjoy it. \"I'd be an idiot to do that now,\" he says flatly. Jess says Tyler doesn't like talking about five-year plans or what the future holds, but when pushed to say how long he'll keep going, he answers:\n\n\"Until my family is taken care of. Say this ends tomorrow, we don't have enough for the rest of our lives. I tell Jess, 'Honey, we're not going to have that much quality time this year, or even next year. But if we do this right and I continue to grind for a couple more years, we can set ourselves up, and our family and our family's family, for the rest of our lives.'\"\n\nON THE THIRD night of Lollapalooza, after days of streaming and being mobbed by fans, Ninja decides to go undercover at night. He dons Jess' large Louis Vuitton sunglasses, flattens his pink hair under a Bulls hat and walks through the crowds around Michigan Avenue undetected, just another face in the festive streets. \"It's working! It's working!\" he says gleefully.\n\nThey walk into the hotel, and there it is, the first cry of recognition: Ninja!\n\nJess and his crew beg for quiet. They're just trying to go to bed. But it doesn't work. The crowd, young, drunk and sunburned, takes notice. A hundred phones lift in the air, the cries of Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! reverberating through the marble lobby.\n\nI'd left Ninja hours earlier. He wanted some privacy to enjoy Logic's show. But I didn't need to be there to witness this scene. I saw what happened alongside the rest of the world that night in a video he posted on social media, with the caption, \"Trying to sneak out of @lollapalooza day 3! Mission failed.\"\n\nEven as he's taking time off, he keeps the camera on. Content is everything.\n\nElaine TengTeng is a general editor at ESPN The Magazine.",

    "authors": [],
    "raw_text": "EVERYONE CALLS HIM T. It could stand for trainer or teacher, but really it's a play off his first name, Tareq. Today, one of the final days in July before NFL players head to training camp, T busies himself in the Front Street gym he named Empower. So many people are here. All-Pro Rams corner Marcus Peters sits on an exercise ball in the calisthenics space just off the main hall, nodding his head to the hip-hop blaring from the speakers, thumbing a message on his phone. He came to Tareq Azim in part because Peters' cousin, Marshawn Lynch, trained here; Azim helped Lynch unleash Beast Mode. Lynch still refers to Azim as \"family,\" and Peters calls him \"big brother,\" mostly because of what Azim has helped him realize away from the field. \"It ain't about ball,\" Peters says.\n\nRaiders running back Jalen Richard sits next to Peters on a plyometric jump box, staring at the racks of dumbbells against the far wall, preparing for the hell that will be his workout. Two years ago Richard scored a 75-yard touchdown against the Saints on his first NFL run. What remains as surreal as that afternoon are the conversations he has now with Azim. Take the previous Sunday. He went to a barbecue joint with Tareq and his brother Yossef, a cop who patrols the Tenderloin, San Francisco's toughest neighborhood. Tareq started talking about Afghanistan -- how a decade ago Tareq had stared down Taliban warlords to reclaim his family's ancestral lands -- before shifting to a discussion about the conditions of poverty wherever they are found, the actions they excuse and the lives they constrict. Richard nodded his head. He's from Alexandria, Louisiana, in the central part of the state, and had such a bleak and blinkered childhood that the 75-yard touchdown against the Saints? It was the first time either he or his parents had been to the Superdome. \"The conversations we have, that I have with T,\" Richard says, \"I don't really have those conversation with nobody else.\"\n\nBrushing past Richard now is Azim himself. At 36, he still possesses the compact power he had as a D-I linebacker, and he walks quickly to catch up to Jed York, the owner of the 49ers and a client here. York finished a workout 20 minutes ago and is still in gray shorts and a black T-shirt. Azim leans in close so York can hear him above the blaring music. They are business partners too, York so intrigued by the ethos of Azim's gym that he had a separate Empower built within the Niners facility in Santa Clara, for staff and administration. \"The best thing about T, he just cuts through everything,\" York says. \"There's no pretense.\"\n\nAs Azim and York navigate the gym, they do so carefully because of all the Englishmen. The place is teeming with them. Yesterday, the coach of England's Sevens national rugby club stopped by. He'd heard about Empower, the secrets that athletes learn here, and with the 7-on-7 Rugby World Cup at AT&T Park this weekend, his lads were in need of a place to lift. Brawny rugby players with black jerseys and pale skin are everywhere, squatting in the squat rack and prancing around the heavy bags, hard against the boxing ring, or just standing against the wall here in the calisthenics room, sizing up the six NFL and MMA guys who are about to take their orders from Azim.\n\nI catch Tareq's eye as he finishes with York and make a face that says, This is nuts. His smile says, Just another Tuesday. It's true. Luke Rockhold, a former UFC champion and the new face of Ralph Lauren (not joking) is here all week. Gavin Newsom, very likely the next governor of California, will be here Thursday. Dion Jordan, after meetings and workouts with the Seahawks in Seattle, will be back Friday.\n\nThe music gets louder and still more aggressive, a cue for the NFL and MMA crew to finish stretching. I join them. Because I wanted to experience what makes this place different, Azim had suggested I work out with the pros. I look around me as I stretch my triceps: The room is 30 paces long and FieldTurfed, with mirrors lining the left wall. What will happen here?\n\nAzim walks before us. He is all broad chest and cauliflower ear and alpha male energy. Hollywood would cast him as a successful D-I wrestling coach. He likes to listen to people and when he at last interjects, his honesty is often bracing. \"Take a lap,\" he says, in the voice of your favorite P.E. teacher. And so we do, out against the cool breeze, past the tech startups and the park where the homeless mingle, then back into the gym and the calisthenics room.\n\nWe will do a leg workout, high intensity, using only our bodyweight. Azim teaches \"humility,\" he says, and if NFL guys (and ESPN writers) struggle to lift even their own bodies, perhaps they will pick up on the deeper lesson of our temporality, how death is coming regardless and if one \"prepares for death,\" one can seize each day fully, be not just a sack leader but a great husband, father, brother, human. For Azim's faithful -- and they are \"not normal people,\" he says of the iconoclasts and castoffs of the NFL and combat sports -- the workouts aren't only about getting \"comfortable with discomfort\" but metaphors on the redeeming qualities of the human condition. It is a threatening message, especially for leagues that ask their athletes to play and hit but never question. It is also a message that has allowed Azim to move from an outsider to the insider's insider, the sort of guru who turns away more athletes than he could ever train and declines, routinely but also respectfully, the offers from NFL clubs to come on as a special liaison to players.\n\nWe start with a series of squats, then hold the stance when our butts are parallel to the turf. We stay there, frozen, and from that position Azim tells us to lift one leg and stomp it down. Stomp, stomp, stomp. Over and over. The burn is excruciating. \"Keep it up!\" Azim shouts. We grunt. I let loose a gasp of pain. Still we stomp.\n\n\"Time!\"\n\nIt is over. It is not over. The other leg now.\n\nAnd this is one set of four.\n\nWe do just-as-difficult movements on the floor to strengthen our glutes and hamstrings. Halfway through the workout, I feel lightheaded. Black dots appear on my vision's periphery. I think about how I will not embarrass myself. I will not faint in front of the pros. The dizziness passes.\n\nThe hardest exercise is the last. Azim puts medicine balls on the floor. We are to squat down behind the balls and push them across the turf to the far wall. It sounds easy. It is also impossible. My hands ride up the leather casing and the heavy ball loses all momentum and I tumble ahead of it and splay across the turf. I try to get the ball moving again, but it's brutal, my legs quivering from the burn, and when I think I've found the right position on the ball, my hands inch up once more. Now I am embarrassing myself.\n\nWe push the medicine ball many times. Some pros struggle too. Before my last round, I tamp down the frustration and humiliation that had powered my previous attempts. I exhale and study the ball. I choose a lower position and tell myself to be in concert, my hands and feet pushing as one. I grunt, and this time the ball glides across the turf. Azim comes over and kicks the side of his foot against the ball to slow my momentum, something he has done with Marcus Peters, who's mastered this drill. Like Peters, I'm able to keep my hands low, my hips back. Azim keeps kicking, but I cannot be stopped.\n\nI reach the far wall. He smiles at me.\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nFOR AZIM, EMOTIONAL resilience and even physical strength are born from the moments that humble us. Azim first learned the lessons of humility as a kid in Concord, in the East Bay. His family ultimately settled there as refugees after they'd fled Afghanistan. They lived in Section 8 housing. Sometimes they didn't have enough food stamps to buy milk. It was quite a contrast to their old lives in Kabul.\n\nTareq descended from Afghan nobility. His maternal great-grandfather brought fighter jets from Italy and established the Afghan Air Force. His maternal grandfather, Gen. Shaw Wali, commanded Bagram Air Base and was close to the Afghan royal family. There are photos of the general with Queen Elizabeth. Tareq's parents \"grew up with golden spoons in their mouths,\" he says, part of an Afghanistan in the 1950s and '60s that was open to trade and had a robust press, back when Europe influenced the country's fashion and many women chose not to wear hijabs.\n\nThe Communist takeover of the late '70s changed everything. Anyone who stood up to Soviet rule after the coup d'etat was imprisoned, tortured and killed. The Communists came for Gen. Wali in 1979. He said to his wife as he was escorted out of his house: \"Don't turn your back on Afghanistan.\"\n\nHis family had to, though. They would have been killed otherwise. But the general's last message became family lore, and his daughter Mina kept his words with her as she and her husband, Sayed Fazel Azim, raised their three kids in mangy Concord. The couple talked endlessly of going back to Afghanistan, the duty each Azim owed the nation -- lay the bricks for a better life there, Mina often said -- even as their children acclimated to the States. Dina, the oldest, played volleyball. Tareq and Yossef took up taekwondo before Tareq found boxing, then soccer, then track. In the East Bay's immigrant communities, \"I used to get bashed all the time,\" Tareq says. \"'Look at him: He's doing all the white-boy s---.'\"\n\nTareq needed the distraction. His father had episodes of manic depression. Tareq remembers one time as a boy when he climbed a fig tree. His dad loved figs, and when Tareq had grabbed enough from the branches, he bundled the gift in his shirt and ran back to the house.\n\n\"He was sitting on his bed, just sitting there staring straight ahead,\" Tareq recalls. The young son yelled, \"Dad! Dad!\" but Sayed kept staring. He wouldn't look at anything but some point on the wall. Tareq, scared, dropped the figs to the floor. He tried kissing his father to shake him from his trance. When that didn't work, he ran from the room and called 911. The ambulance took Sayed away in a straitjacket.\n\nSayed's mental illness became something -- like the menial jobs he and Mina worked -- that the Azim family simply dealt with. \"We grew up like, 'Hey, give Dad his medicine,'\" Tareq says.\n\nTareq found a release in football. He'd come to the sport late, starting as a kicker on the freshman team -- soccer carried ancillary benefits -- and discovered he liked hitting people more. \"I got addicted,\" he says. With his background in boxing, he had great hand-eye coordination and became a fast, aggressive outside linebacker. He dreamed of being the first Afghan-American to make the NFL. He averaged a sack a game his senior year and led the Ygnacio Valley Warriors to the Northern California sectional championship.\n\nAfter two years at a juco, Fresno State saw promise in Azim but couldn't settle on where to put him. He moved from linebacker to rushing defensive end to fullback. The Bulldogs' coaching staff said they'd return him to outside 'backer for his senior year. Just before it started, Azim ruptured disks in his spine. The surgery and recovery time consumed almost all of his season. Still, he remained optimistic: With a good pro day, Azim knew he could latch on to an NFL team.\n\nWhile Azim trained in the early months of 2004, his father had returned to Afghanistan. Large swaths of the family's ancestral acreage in Kabul, and in the Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, where Tareq's family was akin to tribal royalty, were being sold off, often to warlords, and without Sayed's blessing. He had to reclaim it.\n\nTareq loved his father; Sayed was kind and gentle. Could the aging man really stare down a warlord? Would he in his native land have another flare-up of the illness that had worsened in the States? Sayed never pressed, never even asked Tareq to join him, but the son knew he had a choice: fealty to Afghanistan or to his dreams of the NFL? The question was really the loudest refrain yet of the chorus he'd heard his whole childhood: Will you lay the bricks for others or lay them for yourself?\n\nDAYS AFTER TAREQ graduated from college, Sayed got a call from a number he didn't recognize.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Dad. It's Tareq.\"\n\nWhat's this, Sayed said? Some Skype number or something?\n\n\"No, I'm in Dubai.\"\n\nTareq was calling from a phone at the airport. \"I arrive in Kabul at 10 a.m. your time.\"\n\nHis younger brother, Yossef, had told Tareq not to go. \"It's chaos,\" he'd said. The American-led invasion in 2001 had snuffed out the members of al-Qaida who'd trained in Afghanistan but now, some two years later, with America fighting a second war in Iraq, Taliban warlords and other tribal sects had re-emerged, battling over old territories. The Afghan government was too weak to stop them. It was so unsafe in Kabul at the time, Pulitzer Prize winner Steve Coll wrote in \"Directorate S,\" a clandestine history of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, that when an SUV in a heavily armed American convoy one day accidentally struck a woman wearing a burqa, no soldier stopped to get out. No vehicle in the convoy even slowed to see if the woman was alive. If American convoys stopped, American convoys risked getting blown up. The vehicles continued to the airport, where they picked up Hillary Clinton, then a U.S. senator and vociferous champion of the rights of Afghan women.\n\nTareq Azim flew into that same airport about six months later. He had \"bad intentions,\" he says. He'd learned that some of his Afghan relatives had been the ones to secretly sell plots of his father's acreage. To get the land back, especially from the warlords whose attitude was Try to get me off it, \"I would react however they acted,\" Tareq thought. \"If they wanted to punch, I would punch. If they wanted to shoot, I would shoot.\"\n\nAfter landing on the decrepit runway, deplaning via a rickety ladder, and seeing on the 10-minute drive to his father's Kabul estate the effect of 25 years of war -- the bombed-out detritus of \"commercial\" districts, a woman who begged and held up a starving and perhaps dead baby by its ankle -- Tareq was \"extremely disgusted with myself,\" he says. How could he add to this carnage? Wasn't this place, this much-mythologized place, which had become the fourth-poorest country in the world after a war with the Communists and a second with itself and now a third featuring the Americans, wasn't this place also in need of something hopeful, something better, to return it to the esteem the Azims had held for it?\n\nTareq cried in the car.\n\nFor him, what became as vital as reclaiming the parcels of land was improving the lives of the people who lived near them. In Kabul, Tareq befriended 12- and 13-year-olds and one day took them for ice cream. The kids stopped before a certain block -- Block 12 in Tareq's nomenclature, because the city was too bombed out for street names -- and said they couldn't walk farther. A rival gang controlled that street. Cross it, and gang members might bomb your car or throw Molotov cocktails through your apartment window.\n\nAzim had a thought. The only way people listened to each other, the only way people had listened to him, as an immigrant in Concord, was through the language of sports. If he could get the kids to communicate, he could perhaps stanch the flow of blood.\n\nThat's how Azim came to set up a neighborhood soccer league, which often played its games within view of Block 12. The Block 12 kids, curious, edged closer to the field of play until, one by one, they joined in. The league spawned from there. Neighborhoods taking on other neighborhoods, girls joining the games, Azim going door to door to explain to parents -- who'd lived through the '90s and the Taliban's edicts against music, singing and women's rights -- about the benefits of a sport like soccer. Through these conversations, Tareq heard of a man named Abdul Saboor Walizada, who'd started a separate girls soccer league in Kabul. Azim teamed up with Walizada. The girls laughed at their new, obviously American coach, who didn't care about the cultural norms that stated men couldn't talk to women who weren't their wives or sisters. Azim talked with anybody, in Dari or Pashto or English, if the girls knew it. He encouraged them on the pitch, joked with them off it, and the new girls league took off, with divisions and age ranks. Suddenly neighboring provinces wanted in. Azim had planned to stay in the country a month, and here it was a year later and the work as Walizada's deputy consumed him. He traveled, he cajoled, he carried out administrative duties until it was no longer a girls league at all but a nationally sanctioned women's soccer federation. It spanned a handful of cities and 25 teams.\n\n\"I used to stand and watch soccer and think, 'Maybe in an afterlife I could play it myself,'\" says Shamila Kohestani, the first captain of the Afghan women's national team. \"It was a great thing ... to finally have a place where we were accepted as athletes.\"\n\nAnd then, in 2006, ESPN called. Girls aligned with the emerging national team had just won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. Could a few players and Azim and Walizada fly to Los Angeles, to be honored at the ESPYS?\n\nAFTER THE AWARDS ceremony and parties, and after the seven other Afghans exhausted their questions about America, Azim returned to Afghanistan. It felt increasingly like home. Yes, he'd negotiated with warlords to reclaim his father's land and, yes, violence remained as ubiquitous as the country's corruption, but Afghanistan wasn't just radical mullahs, death and bribes either. Here he could continue to change perceptions. Here he could lay bricks, and maybe build something of his own, something even more impressive than the soccer federation.\n\nHe had a second, bolder thought. If the maxim were true that empowering a woman liberated a family, what if Azim literally made Afghan women as powerful as men?\n\nWhat if he taught them to box?\n\nHis friends and extended family said it was a terrible idea. Even his mother, the one whose lay bricks mantra and strong will lived in Tareq's favorite photo -- an image of a radiant Mina, enjoying a cigarette in Kunar, next to her AK-47 -- even she thought Tareq had gone too far this time. In certain provinces, \"People don't want girls to go to school,\" she told him. \"How will you convince them to let girls box?\"\n\nStill, he couldn't let the idea go. Its bright promise lit his days. The confidence he'd had as a young boxer- -- what if women here had that? So how to convince everyone? Well, Afghanistan ran on tribal politics. Azim would simply have to paint for the largest tribal rulers a portrait of the future he saw. He isolated three leaders, the most menacing of whom was Mullah Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, a high-ranking Taliban politician and former spokesman for the regime's brutal supreme commander, Mullah Mohammed Omar. If a Taliban official endorsed Azim's idea, who could be against it?\n\nPresident Hamid Karzai's government had at one point placed Muttawakil under house arrest for the bloodshed he'd ordered or condoned, a predicament that did not necessarily limit Muttawakil's influence within the Taliban. Through Azim's growing Rolodex, he discovered Muttawakil lived now in a guarded compound on the western edge of Kabul.\n\nAzim didn't tell the American embassy about his plans, much less his family, but did agree to a request from a documentary film crew, which had learned of Tareq through the ESPYS and wanted to follow him now. One day Tareq and Peter Getzels, a producer and director from Washington, D.C., headed out to meet Muttawakil.\n\nThey drove to a mountainous nowhere-world 25 minutes outside downtown Kabul. Amid this moonscape they saw men with assault rifles guarding a small compound.\n\nWild thoughts ran through Azim's head: What if it all went wrong and he and Getzels were shot in the back? What if they were disappeared? At the same time, an equally delirious confidence buoyed him: He could do this. He'd done it before; he'd just been honored for doing the \"impossible.\"\n\nBesides, he thought, the plan had to work. The one thing he'd intentionally left in Kabul was a gun.\n\nHe and Getzels were led to a room with red carpet and love seats. Muttawakil appeared, bearded and bespectacled and soft-bodied, in flowing Afghan garb. He looked more like an imam than a hardened political killer.\n\nThey sat down. \"I played sports in America,\" Azim said in Pashto. He had given this moment a lot of thought. \"I understand community. I understand unity. I understand the power of sports. It's just not right that our kids don't have opportunities -- or [aren't] able to learn about themselves, [aren't] able to build confidence...\"\n\nMuttawakil nodded. The suspicion in his face softened just a bit. The pair traded anecdotes about Afghanistan and Islam in Dari and Pashto. One hour passed, then two. Azim's fear transformed little by little into something like hope as they moved into their third hour. Muttawakil said the Taliban, despite its reputation, wanted social progress, and so would not interfere with Azim's wishes or harm him personally. He asked only that young women follow Sharia law and dress conservatively: no sports bras in the ring. Azim agreed. Muttawakil put his hand on Azim's and said the female boxing program would be a \"symbolic\" testament to a new Afghanistan. \"Go,\" he said, his face alit.\n\nAzim opened the first gym on the grounds of Ghazi Stadium in Kabul, where the Taliban in the '90s had beheaded dissidents. He wanted \"to prove to the world that Afghanistan is ready for social change.\"\n\nWithout the aid of foreign governments or the guidance of NGOs, he worked with provincial governors and everyday Afghans to help open 36 more gyms, with around 250 girls and young women training and sparring regularly. One of them, Sadaf Rahimi, became the first female boxer in Afghanistan invited to the Olympics. \"I wanted to prove that Afghan girls could do everything, too,\" she told the international media.\n\nIt should have been a fairy-tale ending. But 10 days before the London Games, the International Boxing Association revoked Rahimi's Olympic invitation, citing a curious claim about her lack of preparedness. (Azim thought the revocation had more to do with Afghan politics and the anger from hard-lined conservatives that the boxing program had induced.) Even before the Rahimi mess, Azim saw the boxing federation fall prey to what-about-me infighting and petty corruption. \"It broke my heart,\" Azim says. \"When all that hijacking s--- began, I learned to not think that anything [in Afghanistan] was mine.\"\n\nHe realized that perhaps only in the States could his bricks build a lasting structure.\n\nWHAT STAYED WITH him when he returned to the Bay Area in 2008 was that meeting with Muttawakil. He, Tareq Azim, an American civilian, had actually met with a leader of the Taliban -- unarmed! -- and gotten the guy to bless his progressive idea. Azim had found a way to stare through his fear and accomplish something not even his mother thought possible.\n\nWhat else would people do when fear no longer bound them?\n\nHe worked in various Bay Area gyms to test this question, and little by little his client list grew until it included MMA champion Jake Shields and football players from Oakland, Raiders QBs Charlie Frye and Bruce Gradkowski. They each found that the inaugural session with Azim did not cover the proper form on bench press. It was a sit-down that went something like this:\n\nAzim said they had a \"disease of fear.\" To move past it, he told his athletes to first imagine the worst that could happen to them now, today. Invariably the athletes said they could die. Azim told them that they'd die anyway and that they needed to prepare for it, much as he had in Afghanistan. By preparing for death, they could fully realize the gift that was life, and live as fully realized people, not just myopic professional athletes. None of this would be easy. To move beyond fear, they -- tough NFL players and combat sport pros -- had to first acknowledge they were fearful, which meant allowing themselves to be vulnerable, which meant being honest with themselves and everyone who walked into the gym. And if they sought this level of truth, they could, as the Quran put it, be excellent in everything they did.\n\nGradkowski and Frye were in awe. They went back to Raiders coach Tom Cable: You gotta meet this dude. Cable did. No one in the NFL talked like this. Azim was training so much more than players' bodies. Word spread along the West Coast and ultimately reached the Seahawks coaching staff. They had a running back who was underperforming. Perhaps that guru guy in San Francisco could help.\n\nAzim had opened his own gym, Empower, and within 30 minutes of Marshawn Lynch meeting him there, Lynch pounded his chest and declared, \"My brother!\" The socially conscious Lynch already was living what Azim was preaching, so of course he would follow The Game Plan, what Azim's acolytes now called the personalized goals that emerged from that first sit-down. Over the coming seasons, the trainer who was more than a trainer helped pull out the All-Pro within Lynch. That left hook of a stiff-arm that went viral against the Niners' Patrick Willis in 2013? Born out of the boxing Lynch and Azim did in Empower.\n\nLynch's trip to Haiti in 2016, to provide relief after the country's massive earthquake? Lynch had always been charitable -- that's why he and Azim clicked -- but the trainer says, \"I try to normalize all the not-normal dreams of athletes.\" The pair got so close that Marshawn began to refer to Sayed Azim as \"my dog,\" so close that when Lynch needed hernia surgery in November 2015, Tareq dropped his holiday vacation plans and rehabbed Lynch every day for two and a half weeks, through Christmas and New Year's, to get the running back ready for the Seahawks' playoff game against the Panthers.\n\n\"Tareq wants to be the one to take on the brunt of other people's problems or issues,\" says his wife, Megan, who met Tareq in 2012, as Empower started to draw the attention of Lynch and other stars like Justin Tuck and Barry Zito. \"And Tareq also wants to be the one who alleviates any of those situations.\"\n\nOne pro would test him more than any other.\n\nWHEN AZIM \"GAME PLANNED\" Dion Jordan in the summer of 2015, \"You could tell he was broken,\" Azim says today. \"You could tell he hadn't loved himself for a long time.\" A lot of athletes hung at Empower before or after their workouts, but Azim mandated it of Jordan. \"With Dion it was an eight-hour shift,\" Azim says. Get to the gym at the start of business. Attend meetings with Azim, \"just to hear what's up: how I sell, how I work, how I build relationships.\" Then train. Get massaged and stretched. Lunch. AA. Then back to Empower for more meetings. \"The gym was like my second home,\" Jordan says. As the weeks turned into months and then into years, Jordan chose as his actual home a rented apartment just down the street from Empower.\n\n\"With Dion,\" Azim says, trying to find the words, because while he has a familial relationship with his athletes, something else developed with Jordan, \"his level of dependency and appreciation helped me feel really valuable.\" Here at last was the calling equal to Azim's ambition, equal to his desire to give and not have the results ruined by outside forces. Getting Jordan back to the field -- it was almost as if Azim had found his life's work.\n\n\u0093I try to normalize all the not-normal dreams of athletes.\u0094\n\n- Tareq Azim\n\nThe bond deepened. Azim said they had to do a good deed a day. One afternoon he and Jordan went to Subway and bought 100 sandwiches and drove all over San Francisco, delivering them to the homeless. They read a chapter of a book each day. One of their favorites was \"Purification of the Heart,\" a treatise by Islamic scholar Hamza Yusuf. \"We of the modern world,\" Yusuf wrote, \"are reluctant to ask ourselves -- when we look at the terrible things that are happening -- 'Why do they occur?' And if we ask that with all sincerity, the answer will come resoundingly: 'All of this is from your own selves.'\" Azim asked Jordan to visualize his return to the NFL, a once laughable premise -- the world outside Empower saw Jordan as perhaps the biggest bust in league history -- but it was an idea that became more rooted in reality with each passing day. \"Set the tempo and the standard for your first game back,\" Azim told him. \"What will it feel like when you get a sack?\n\n\"Everyone will know who you are.\"\n\nJordan smiled. \"It's a daily challenge to be better,\" he says. \"To be a great son, brother, boyfriend ... but I've learned that's the stuff that's worth it.\"\n\nAzim wasn't surprised when the Seahawks acquired Jordan before the 2017 season. Knee injuries derailed the defensive end's debut, but when it came, in Week 10, the venue seemed fitting: in Arizona, against the Cardinals, 30 miles from that darkened home that Jordan had once refused to leave. Midway through the fourth quarter, Jordan bull-rushed Cardinals left tackle John Wetzel and knocked him flat on his ass, then pulled down quarterback Drew Stanton for the sack.\n\n\"It has been the longest of long roads,\" NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth said on air.\n\nAfter the game, on the charter bus, Jordan took out his phone and FaceTimed Azim. The trainer could barely make out Jordan's face, the bus was so dark, but he could see Jordan's smile.\n\n\"We did it, T. We did it.\"\n\nAZIM SITS AT his desk, hunching over his laptop in the mesh shorts and T-shirt that are his business attire, when his phone chirps with another request to FaceTime from Jordan. It's Wednesday afternoon, one day after my workout with the pros and a few hours after a high school football team trained under Azim, and Marcus Peters told the panting players as they recovered to \"get uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Wassup, bro!\" Azim says now to Jordan, who on the screen is shirtless and seems to have not long ago finished his own workout in Seattle.\n\nJordan smiles. \"Sup!\" They've already talked once today, when Jordan relayed the news that the NFL had decided to no longer randomly drug test him, another sign of how far he has come since 2015.\n\nBoth men would love nothing more than to be together every hour in these last days before training camp. A month earlier, as the Seahawks wrapped their spring organized team activities, Azim floated the idea of Jordan staying in Seattle for a few weeks. \"Let them know what I know,\" he'd said. Jordan had finished 2017 on a tear-four sacks in five games-but if the Seahawks coaching staff had doubts about the sustainability of this new Dion Jordan, \"Let them fall in love with you too,\" Azim told him. \"Let them respect you. Let them believe in you.\"\n\nSo Jordan had stayed in Seattle -- but the dependency had continued. He messaged with Azim all the time. Azim loved it as much as Jordan did. Minutes before Dion FaceTimed him, Azim had said to me: \"Obviously my ego and just my desire of wanting to be around my people, I'm like, 'F---. I wish he was here.'\" He said he was looking forward to Friday, when Jordan would fly back to San Francisco to finish his summer training at Empower.\n\nOn FaceTime now, though, Jordan is anxious. There's something he wants to broach, but it takes a while to say:\n\nHe doesn't know if he should come back to Empower this weekend.\n\n\"Oh,\" Azim says.\n\nJordan backtracks. He will if T wants. It's just the tight schedule ... and then Jordan is stumbling again, unsure of himself. \"What do you think?\"\n\nThe prospect of not seeing Dion before the season stings Azim. As Jordan's consigliere, though, the question is frustrating. Jordan has to start being the CEO of his life. They've talked about this.\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" Azim asks.\n\nJordan mutters something about logistics and difficulty and then in his restless anxiety is a plea they both understand: If you want me down there, T, just say the word.\n\n\"Stay up there,\" Azim says, trying not to grimace.\n\nSince they won't see each other for a while, Azim asks if anything ails Jordan.\n\n\"My knee,\" he says. He had a minor surgery two months earlier and complains now about his \"get offs\": a 50-yard, down-and-back run used to test quickness and agility. Jordan sends Azim a video of one such run. He wants to know if, on that corner turn, his knee is \"firing\" correctly.\n\nAzim watches the video. \"Dude, you look great on film.\" After a moment: \"Is it physical or mental?\"\n\nAzim suspects it's mental.\n\n\"It's physical,\" Jordan says.\n\n\"All right,\" Azim says, not believing him, but wanting to see if Jordan can stare through this fear about his knee -- probably a proxy for his fear about remaining in Seattle this week -- and find his way to the answer, a fragment of a deeper truth that keeps alluding Jordan.\n\n\"Walk me through why it's physical.\"\n\nJordan says he feels it could be in his hips.\n\nAzim nods his head. \"Have you been doing your hip activation?\" It's a series of movements -- a workout, actually -- to get Jordan's legs moving with no wasted effort.\n\nJordan says he hasn't been doing it as often as he should.\n\n\"So it sounds like there's a lot more on your knees,\" Azim says, \"because your hips aren't cooperating with your feet.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" Jordan says, liking that answer.\n\nAzim stares at Jordan. He gives away nothing.\n\nIn the end, bricklaying is a funny business. For three years, you can stack bricks with someone you love. But as the edifice rises before you, the best you've ever built, you realize the building that will matter more is the one your friend has yet to construct, alone.\n\nAzim lets the moment drag out.\n\nJordan frowns. \"I also got to get it in my head that I'm fine.\"\n\nAzim tries to stay as calm as he can.\n\n\"OK, cool,\" Azim says at last, in a voice he hopes is level.\n\nMoments later he signs off with Jordan, and smiles.\n\nPaul KixKix is a deputy editor for ESPN The Magazine and ESPN.com.

    "raw_text": "As part of the stories of the year collection, this piece is being resurfaced along with others in the coming days as ESPN Digital and Print Media closes out the year. Check out the full list here.\n\nON THE MORNING of Jan. 17, 2014, Madison Holleran awoke in her dorm room at the University of Pennsylvania. She had spent the previous night watching the movie The Parent Trap with her good friend Ingrid Hung. Madison went to class. She took a test. She told a few friends she would meet them later that night at the dining hall. She went to the Penn bookstore and bought gifts for her family.\n\nWhile she was there, her dad called. \"Maddy, have you found a therapist down there yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, but don't worry, Daddy, I'll find one,\" she told him.\n\nBut she had no intention of finding one. In fact, she was, at that exact moment, buying the items she would leave for her family at the top of a parking garage. Godiva chocolates for her dad. Two necklaces for her mom. Gingersnaps for her grandparents, who always had those cookies in their home. Outfits for her nephew, Hayes, who had been born two weeks earlier. The Happiness Project for Ingrid, with a note scribbled inside. And a picture of herself as a young kid, holding a tennis racket. Over winter break she had told her dad that she was borrowing that picture, that she needed it for something.\n\nShe didn't say what.\n\nThen, on the evening of Jan. 17, just after dusk settled on the city, Madison took a running leap off the ninth level of a parking garage in downtown Philadelphia.\n\nShe was 19 years old.\n\nMADISON LOVED QUOTES. Sometimes she took a picture of the words, spotted in a magazine, and posted the image on social media. Other times she wrote down the quote -- in beautiful script, to be framed -- so she could revisit the sentiment anytime she wanted.\n\nShe loved to draw, write in her journal and read. She enjoyed long runs, singing in the car, sushi, and bananas with peanut butter.\n\nShe also loved her big New Jersey family. She was especially close with her dad, whom she called \"Big Jimbo.\" He was her biggest fan. He came to her soccer games and track meets, always wrapping her in a hug afterward. He believed she could do anything.\n\nFamily and friends used to joke that whenever they opened the Bergen Record, they saw a picture of Madison, another athletic feat captured in print: so many goals scored, so many track meets won.\n\nLife seemed good; life was good.\n\nThen Madison left for college. She had decided to run track at Penn, only two hours from home, but it felt like a foreign land to her. Everything seemed to change. Running had once made her feel alive, but at Penn she couldn't breathe. Her friends had once made everything better; now they just couldn't understand.\n\nEVERYONE IN MADISON'S LIFE holds a piece of her story, possesses a clue: a text message, a vacant look, a deleted Instagram post. In the days after she died, the people who knew her best converged on Allendale, New Jersey, her hometown; siblings (one brother, three sisters), parents (Jim and Stacy), high school friends, college classmates -- all offered their shattered piece to see whether they could rebuild Madison.\n\nIt was as if they hoped she might be breathed back to life. As if they might then do and say the things they hadn't known she needed.\n\nMadison was beautiful, talented, successful -- very nearly the epitome of what every young girl is supposed to hope she becomes. But she was also a perfectionist who struggled when she performed poorly. She was a deep thinker, someone who was aware of the image she presented to the world, and someone who often struggled with what that image conveyed about her, with how people superficially read who she was, what her life was like.\n\nTHE LIFE MADISON projected on her own Instagram feed was filled with shots that seemed to confirm everyone's expectations: Of course she was loving her first year of college. Of course she enjoyed running. Her mom remembers looking at a photo on her feed and saying, \"Madison, you look like you're so happy at this party.\"\n\n\"Mom,\" Madison said. \"It's just a picture.\"\n\nEveryone presents an edited version of life on social media. People share moments that reflect an ideal life, an ideal self. Hundreds of years ago, we sent letters by horseback, containing only what we wanted the recipient to read. Fifty years ago, we spoke via the telephone, sharing only the details that constructed the self we wanted reflected.\n\nWith Instagram, one thing has changed: the amount we consume of one another's edited lives. Young women growing up on Instagram are spending a significant chunk of each day absorbing others' filtered images while they walk through their own realities, unfiltered. In a recent survey conducted by the Girl Scouts, nearly 74 percent of girls agreed that other girls tried to make themselves look \"cooler than they are\" on social networking sites.\n\nNo image captures the paradoxes of Madison's Instagram account more than the one she posted just an hour before jumping off the parking garage. Holiday lights are twinkling in the trees of Rittenhouse Square, and Madison put a filter on the image that produced an ethereal quality, almost as if the night is underwater.\n\nShe seemed acutely aware that the life she was curating online was distinctly different from the one she was actually living. Yet she could not apply that same logic when she looked at the projected lives of others. Before going home for winter break, she asked Ingrid, who was also struggling at Penn, \"What are you going to say when you go home to all your friends? I feel like all my friends are having so much fun at school.\"\n\nShe and Ashley Montgomery, a friend and track teammate, followed a group of Penn upperclassmen on Instagram. They would scroll through pictures and say to each other, \"This is what college is supposed to be like; this is what we want our life to be like.\"\n\nMadison's high school friends had told her they were also struggling. Emma Sullivan was running track at Boston College and having a hard time. Another friend, Jackie Reyneke, was playing basketball at Princeton and feeling overwhelmed. They had all shared some form of their struggles with Madison, yet in her mind, the lives her friends were projecting on social media trumped the reality they were privately sharing.\n\nThis confused them, and it still does.\n\nChecking Instagram is like opening a magazine to see a fashion advertisement. Except an ad is branded as what it is: a staged image on glossy paper.\n\nInstagram is passed off as real life.\n\nYes, people filter their photos to make them prettier. People are also often encouraged to put filters on their sadness, to brighten their reality so as not to \"drag down\" those around them. The myth still exists that happiness is a choice, which perpetuates the notion of depression as weakness.\n\nLife must be Instagrammed -- in more ways than one.\n\nMADISON ONCE POSTED a picture collage of her dad on Instagram with the caption, \"Happy Father's Day to Big Jimbo, the greatest man I've ever known and ever will know. Love you with all my heart Daddio.\"\n\nEvery summer they attended the U.S. Open, the last of the tennis grand slams. Madison loved watching the best female players, occasionally wondering aloud whether she could have played tennis at the highest level.\n\n\"Of course you could,\" Jim said.\n\nThe first inkling he had that his daughter wasn't doing well at Penn was when she refused to come with him to Flushing Meadows, site of the U.S. Open, just after the start of her freshman year. She said she was too swamped with schoolwork and practice. He offered to drive down to Philly from Allendale, a four-hour round trip, just so she could get a break from what he sensed had become a high-pressure environment.\n\nBut Jim didn't press her. \"I should have just driven down there and gotten her,\" he says, letting the sentence trail off.\n\nMadison's older sister Ashley had started college at Penn State just two years before. She was unhappy, so she transferred to Alabama, where life improved. Jim and Stacy thought Madison must be going through something similar. A change of scenery was what she needed. An easy fix like that and Madison would continue her upward trajectory.\n\n\"This is normal,\" her sister Carli told her. \"People leave home, they're unhappy, they transfer -- they figure it out.\"\n\nMadison shook her head: \"It's not normal. It's not normal to feel like this.\"\n\nShe started seeing a therapist during Thanksgiving break and would continue seeing the woman through winter break. The closest Madison came to a diagnosis was \"battling anxiety.\"\n\n\"There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that happened when she was younger, growing up, that makes sense of the decision she made,\" Stacy says. \"Am I angry at her? Yes, of course I am.\"\n\nEveryone now agrees that Madison was depressed, though she had never previously exhibited symptoms. (Depression exists on Jim's side of the family.) Something had changed with her brain chemistry. She was not seeing the world in the same way she had before. She had lost weight too, had become so thin as to appear sick.\n\nThe day before Madison returned to Penn for spring semester, she had a session with her therapist that Jim also attended. She admitted to having suicidal thoughts. \"If you have suicidal thoughts, don't act them out,\" her doctor said. \"Either call me or call someone in your family.\"\n\nMadison nodded.\n\nAs a family, they had never talked about suicide. Jim never considered it a real possibility -- just the dramatic ending to someone else's story. As Carli explains: \"Other people battle depression for years. With Madison, it feels like one day she was happy, the next she was sad and the day after she was gone.\"\n\nJim feared that speaking about suicide would make its likelihood greater. He didn't raise the subject as he and Madison drove back to Philadelphia.\n\nBill Schmitz Jr., former president of the American Association of Suicidology, points out that depression does not have a one-size-fits-all prognosis. \"The course varies,\" he says. \"In a way, it's the same as cancer. For some, we might prolong life for months, for years. For others, it can be very sudden.\"\n\nJim drove Madison back to Philadelphia on Jan. 11. As they approached the exit off I-95, he offered to keep driving, to put Philly in the rearview mirror, to drive south, to the University of North Carolina or Vanderbilt University -- to somewhere, anywhere. She could enroll at a new school, start over.\n\n\"Let's just keep driving,\" he said. \"Let's enroll you somewhere else.\"\n\nShe shook her head. She had promised to meet friends at a Penn basketball game.\n\nAs he left his daughter that evening, Jim remembers looking at Madison and thinking, She's still not happy; that's not a happy kid I'm walking away from.\n\nA few days later, at the start of the spring semester, Stacy and Mackenzie, Madison's youngest sister, drove to Philadelphia to join Madison for a meeting with Steve Dolan, the head track coach at Penn. Madison had told Ingrid she was planning to quit the team.\n\nThe three Hollerans walked into Dolan's office. Madison pulled out a letter she had written outlining why she wanted to quit.\n\n\"I need to figure out if track is making me unhappy, or Penn, or if it's something else,\" she read from the letter. She also spoke of struggling with the training (at that point, she was being coached by an assistant, not Dolan) and with the dorm she was in. She talked about wanting to join a sorority.\n\nDolan listened patiently, but the news surprised him. Madison seemed to have lost perspective, was seeing through a blurred lens, like some kind of dysmorphia. She had excelled in school (GPA of 3.5) and in track during the first semester, despite her constant fears that she was failing at both. To Dolan, she had appeared happy and content.\n\n\"I support you, and I want you to be happy and healthy,\" Dolan said. \"The decision is yours. Do you not want to keep training, keep running?\"\n\nIvy League track is demanding. Madison wasn't the first runner to tell Dolan she might quit. He saw a college freshman in transition, struggling to find her place.\n\nMadison folded the letter and put it away.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she said after a pause. \"I want to keep running.\"\n\nLater that week, Madison heard that another member of the track team had quit. \"I can't believe that,\" she said longingly. \"I really can't.\"\n\nAs they walked out of Dolan's office, Stacy said, \"He is one fabulous coach.\" They walked to Ingrid's dorm room, where Madison told her friend about the meeting, her voice lighter than anyone had heard in months.\n\n\"I drove home feeling pretty good,\" Stacy says. \"I thought she was actually getting better, or starting to. She seemed better, in my mind anyway. But now I know that she was putting on an act that week.\"\n\nMADISON SPENT WINTER break at home, in Allendale.\n\nOver the holiday, she went to her friend Emma Sullivan's house. Emma was one of her best friends; the two spoke more intimately, more deeply, than they did with others, sharing the fears they had about growing up and leaving home.\n\nShe sat at the kitchen table with Emma and her mom. Snow fell heavily outside, sheets of white streaming outside the window. The three women sat there for hours.\n\n\"Why are you not as happy as you used to be?\" Emma asked.\n\n\"Tell us how you're feeling,\" Emma's mom urged.\n\nMadison was unable to identify exactly what had cast her adrift. Was it the disappointment with Penn, once her dream school? Was she homesick? Was track overwhelming her?\n\nAnd the most pressing thought of all: If she quit, wasn't she just a failure? Wouldn't that be the first in what would become a lifetime of letdowns?\n\nMadison had always struggled to handle even garden-variety failure. She chased perfection. Once, when a track result wasn't what she expected, she broke down in tears. Outsiders thought she was so gifted she could just show up and run faster than everyone, not knowing how hard she prepared and trained.\n\nMadison kept her eyes down while sitting at the kitchen table. Emma remembers feeling that her best friend was lost -- just so lost.\n\nLike everyone in Madison's life, Emma urged her to transfer from Penn.\n\n\"Yeah, it's kind of too late,\" Madison told Emma. \"I'm already at Penn.\"\n\nShe said this as if she were locked in a room, the key thrown away.\n\nThat winter break, Madison wanted to keep her circle of seven friends close. They watched movies together. They slept over at one another's houses. And on the final night of break, they got together for a potluck dinner. (Madison brought store-bought sugar cookies; typically, she would have baked.) They called the night \"The Last Supper\" because, in the morning, the first among them would leave for the start of spring semester.\n\nAs the evening ended, Madison said, \"Love you, see you soon!\" as if they'd all see one another in a few weeks, maybe over spring break, maybe sooner.\n\nLater, she sent a text message to Ingrid, a picture of the seven high school friends, arms around one another. \"These are the types of friends we need to find at Penn,\" she said.\n\nTHE NIGHT OF Jan. 17 was chilly, but not unseasonably so. Madison walked the streets of the city, wearing jeans, a sweater and a coat. She carried a shopping bag filled with the goodbye gifts for her family. For a while, she responded to friends on iMessage. Then she stopped.\n\nJust after the sun went down, Madison began walking toward the parking garage at the corner of 15th Street and Spruce.\n\n\"Madison?\" came a voice from across the street.\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Hotline\n\nAre you in crisis? Please take the first step in getting help by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255). The call is free, and you will be connected to a skilled, trained counselor at a crisis center in your area.\n\nLehigh soccer coach Eric Lambinus was standing on the street with assistant coach Amy Hough. The pair had recruited Madison out of high school, but at the last minute she chose Penn. The coaches were standing outside a restaurant. Eric waved to Madison, and she crossed the street toward them.\n\n\"How are you?\" he asked.\n\nMadison mentioned that she was cutting back on track but said otherwise everything was fine. Eric had heard through mutual friends that she was unhappy at Penn, but nothing appeared out of the ordinary.\n\n\"What's in the bag?\" he asked.\n\n\"Some presents for my family,\" she said.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Eric told Madison: \"Just know there are doors open for you still. There are opportunities.\"\n\nThe coach needed to be careful with his words. He didn't want to appear to be poaching another school's student-athlete, but he also wanted to convey to Madison that if she wanted to start the transfer process, to play soccer at Lehigh as she had considered doing out of high school, that option was available. Madison had been one of the best prep soccer players in the state, winning two state titles with Northern Highlands.\n\nMadison thanked him. The two said goodbye. She walked away, toward the parking garage. Eric immediately called his wife to tell her about running into Madison, about what a coincidence it was. Perhaps the meeting was serendipitous, he thought.\n\nA block away, Madison began climbing the nine flights of stairs. When she reached the top, she placed the bag of gifts where it would easily be found. And a few minutes later -- maybe as few as five or as many as 15 -- she hurdled the silver-colored railing. She landed in the bike lane. A woman who did not see her fall stayed with her until an ambulance arrived. The woman believed Madison had passed out, perhaps drunk. Madison did not look like she had jumped from a building. She looked like she was asleep, the only scratch on her a small one, just above her eye.\n\nWhen Eric walked out of the restaurant a little over an hour later, he heard the wail of police cars and ambulances. Something had happened down the street. He walked the other way to avoid the commotion. \"I've gone over that night probably 100 times in my mind,\" he says. \"I wish I had spent a little more time with her, but really nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\"\n\nMore than two hours after Madison jumped, at 9 p.m., Stacy received a call from the 215 area code. Even before she picked up, she felt unsettled.\n\n\"Is Madison OK?\" she said.\n\nIt was Steve Dolan. He told Stacy something was wrong with Madison and he would find out more details and get back to her. Frightened, Stacy called some of Madison's friends at Penn. First on her list was Ingrid.\n\n\"Where is Madison?\" Stacy asked. \"Have you seen her?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't, but we were supposed to eat dinner together tonight.\"\n\n\"Something is wrong,\" Stacy said.\n\nIngrid ran the quarter of a mile from her dorm room to Madison's, calling her friend's roommate on the way. The information to that point was limited: Nobody could find Madison. None of it made sense. Ingrid had just seen her friend that morning, and she had seemed the same as any other day.\n\nIngrid burst into Madison's dorm room -- her friend left the door unlocked. Every other time she'd been there, Madison's bed was unmade, clothes draped across the chair. As Ingrid looked around, alarm bells went off in her mind.\n\nMadison's bed was crisply made.\n\nWithin minutes, campus officials were in the room and Ingrid was back on the phone with her friend's mom, who had received a call from the chaplain.\n\n\"She's gone,\" Stacy said.\n\nNo one can say for sure why Madison chose that specific parking garage. Maybe it doesn't matter. Or maybe it does. Maybe comfort exists in believing there is order in the world, even when someone is making the most disorderly decision we know: running toward death instead of away from it.\n\nIn their absence, we're left trying to pin meaning to air.\n\nNine stories of air.\n\nPHILLY IS THE City of Murals. Hundreds of buildings are covered in artwork.\n\nThere is art on the parking garage from which Madison jumped. On the south side of the structure, on the wall facing Spruce, is a small installation. Quotes, fragments of thoughts, are stenciled in white against a black background, like chalk on a blackboard. The most evocative phrase reads, \"She had wings on.\"\n\nThe wall looks like the rubble, the stacked words from poems never published.\n\nShe had wings on.\n\nMadison left a suicide note that began, \"I thought how unpleasant it is to be locked out, and I thought how it is worse perhaps to be locked in.\" Previously, in her journal, she had written \"Help!\" at the top of one page, followed at the bottom by \"No, no more help.\"\n\nShe also left a copy of the young adult book Reconstructing Amelia, which tells the story of a devastated single mother who pieces together clues about the death of her daughter, who supposedly killed herself by jumping off a building at her prep school. In the book, nothing is as it seems. And at the end, the mother discovers that Amelia didn't jump; she was pushed.\n\nJim cannot bring himself to read the book.\n\n\"Sometimes it's hard to tell how fast the current's moving until you're headed over a waterfall,\" the author writes.\n\nMadison seemed to see a version of herself in Amelia, in the perfectly crafted veneer that never felt like an honest reflection of her interior life. As though she could never find validation for her struggle because how could someone so beautiful, so seemingly put together, be unhappy? This is illogical, of course. Like thinking a computer's hard drive can't malfunction simply because the screen hasn't a scratch.\n\nThe day after Madison jumped, Jim walked to the top of the parking garage. He read the phrase, She had wings on. He spoke with Madison's friends. He compiled clues.\n\nThen he stopped. He could spend his life trying, in vain, to make his child whole again, he thought. Or he could work to keep others from breaking apart.\n\nThe Hollerans are trying now to deliver a new message: It's OK to not be OK. It's OK to show people you're not OK.\n\nASHLEY MONTGOMERY IS now a sophomore at Penn, and she still runs track. When she was a freshman, she and Madison would train together; the two were also close away from the sport. For Ashley, sophomore year has gone much better than freshman year, and she often thinks to herself, If only Maddy were around to feel this, to be here.\n\nFreshman year of college can be like running an obstacle course wearing a blindfold. Nothing prepares you for how hard the workouts will be, how long they last, what each class will be like, which events are fun and which should be avoided.\n\nOnce, as she and Ashley ran through the Penn campus, Madison spotted a quote on the side of a building, part of a mural. She stopped to take a picture. Then she uploaded the image to Instagram.\n\nA few hours later, when Ashley went to Instagram to see the picture, the image was gone. Madison had deleted it.\n\nAfter Madison died, Ashley went running, hoping to find the mural that had caught the attention of her friend.\n\nShe couldn't.\n\n\"We all shared what we knew, and some things were answered,\" Ashley says. \"But we could only do so much. The puzzle will never be complete.\"\n\nTHE TOP OF the parking garage slopes upward. There is a wall, then a silver-colored railing. Because Madison landed out in the street, her friends and family are convinced she took a running leap over the side, clearing the barrier just like she once cleared hurdles on the track.\n\nAt first glance, a running leap off a nine-story building makes little sense. Why not something that seems gentler, easier? (Whatever that means.) Maybe this is because all we can think about, standing at great heights, is the moment of impact, the violence of a falling body hitting concrete. This is exactly what Jim thought of when he went to the top of the parking garage on Jan. 18, 2014, the morning after -- peering over the railing and wondering what that final moment, the impact, must have felt like for his daughter.\n\nEmma hasn't made sense of the act, or the method, but says if forced to make sense of it -- and Madison has forced her to do so -- she can maybe understand why Madison chose jumping. \"If you run and jump, it's freeing -- to just do that. You just jump and it happens. And it's over with. And you don't have to struggle. I can picture her walking up there and just setting her mind to it and knowing it could happen -- that's something I can see her doing. When she gets on that line in track, it's like, 'I'm doing this.' She was always so determined, with everything that she did. Maybe even too determined sometimes.\"\n\nIn high school, Emma and Madison talked about what life would be like as they grew older. (Most of Madison's friends said she rarely spoke of the future with them.) What it would be like to get married, have a family. Both were scared of growing up. Madison never even got her driver's license.\n\n\"We were both so fearful of what was to come,\" Emma says. \"The way her mind worked, it threw her off when she didn't know what the next step was, or what the future would hold. Knowing the end result was something she always wanted.\"\n\nBut maybe Madison had stopped projecting into the future. Maybe picturing the concrete at the base of the parking garage was as impossible as imagining herself in old age.\n\nMaybe she could only imagine the freedom of flying.\n\nEVERY YEAR, MORE than 40,000 Americans die by suicide. Among young adults, ages 10 to 24, suicide is the second-leading cause of death, with more than 4,500 young people taking their lives each year. The suicide rate among NCAA athletes is lower than the general population (0.93 per 100,000, versus 10.9). Between 2004 and 2012, 35 student-athletes took their own lives.\n\nYoung adult suicide profoundly shakes us. Such promise, gone so soon.\n\nWhat happened? Why? What did we miss?\n\nSurvivors search for answers. At first, those left behind are detectives. They are chasing clues. Over time, friends and family begin looking instead for peace, and for some kind of purpose.\n\n\"What happened?\" becomes \"What now?\"\n\nJIM STANDS IN the kitchen of the Holleran family home, looking into the backyard. He and Stacy played college tennis and still play. All their kids play the sport, or played at one time, including the two youngest, Mackenzie and Brendan, both of whom are still in high school. Mackenzie is packing a bag now, about to walk out the door for a lesson.\n\nJim makes a joke about the \"friendly\" rivalry between Mackenzie and Brendan on the tennis court. Everyone laughs.\n\nA worn soccer goal sits in the backyard. Jim gestures out the window and says, \"Madison used to run laps around the yard.\"\n\nA shrine to Madison, with a sketched portrait, a dangling cross and the card from her funeral Mass, sits on a ledge over the dining room table. The Godiva chocolates Madison left for Jim were eaten. He doesn't remember when. The gingersnaps are gone too. Jim and Stacy seem much more interested in sharing Madison's life -- a DVD of her soccer highlights, a binder of newspaper clippings, her senior yearbook filled with notes from adoring classmates -- than the items she left before ending it.\n\nOn the refrigerator is a 2013 holiday card that reads, \"Happy New Year. With love, the Holleran Family.\"\n\nMadison is in the back row. She looks happy.\n\nA week after Madison died, on Jan. 23, 2014, the family launched a Facebook page, \"In Memory of Madison Holleran,\" which has more than 52,000 likes. The site is dedicated to suicide prevention and ending the stigma attached to mental illness. Included on the page are stories of Madison, and stories from people struggling with depression, looking for a community.\n\n\"Sometimes we are all a little broken, but there is always someone to help, always someone who cares,\" one post reads.\n\n\"Please seek help,\" another reads. \"You are not alone.\"\n\nAnd there's this one, from a runner, dated Oct. 6:\n\n\"I run because it's therapeutic for me. Because every time I run outside, around my home, I am reminded of the beauty of the world, of which I often forget. Yet at the same time, I am fully aware of beauty -- it simply saddens me because of reasons I have not yet conjured up. I suppose I am sad. But at the same time I am happy; and miserable; and joyful; and stressed out; and calm, and everything in between. I am everything. Every emotion, rigged in every format, and developed through every machine. I am numb but I am not.\"\n\nA little over a year before she died, Madison posted on Instagram a snapshot of a quote from Seventeen magazine:\n\n\"Even people you think are perfect are going through something difficult.\"\n\nThe image had been put through a filter.\n\nFollow espnW on Twitter: @espnW\n\nFollow ESPN Reader on Twitter: @ESPN_Reader",

    "publish_date": null,
    "authors": [],
    "raw_text": "This story appears in the NFL Preview Issue of ESPN The Magazine. Subscribe today!\n\nBefore he was named an All-Pro cornerback, before he was punched by A.J. Green, before he was suspended for s--t-talking the media and then proceeded to s--t-talk the entire NFL, before he stood on the sideline of Jacksonville's field in a splendid shearling coat and predicted, incorrectly, that the Jaguars were going to go to the Super Bowl and \"win that bitch\" -- before any of those things happened -- Jalen Ramsey sat on a bench and cried.\n\nIt was Nov. 20, 2016, and Jacksonville was about to lose to Detroit and drop to a dismal 2-8. With less than 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the camera lingered on the rookie cornerback for what felt like an eternity. His eyes welled up and he stared into the middle distance, shaking his head like a patient who had just received a devastating prognosis. It was a raw, gutting display of vulnerability and a rare glimpse into an athlete's psyche. While Ramsey is a fount of highlight-worthy plays and oh-no-he-didn't quotes, the shot of him silently weeping during a meaningless game might've been more revealing than anything he's said over the past two years.\n\nNaturally, he was mocked on the internet. And yet: When I ask him why he cried that day in Detroit, he doesn't seem embarrassed in the slightest. \"That was a low moment,\" he says flatly before taking a slurp of his Powerade slush. It's June, and we're sitting across from each other in a Sonic Drive-In in Smyrna, Tennessee, the sleepy Nashville suburb where Ramsey grew up. \"It was like, 'This is getting old. Don't nobody care. Maybe I shouldn't care too.'\"\n\nBut of course he continued to care. Which is why, when he looks back at the experience, he isn't ashamed. He tried. He desperately wanted to win. So he cried, because he was devastated and felt no need to conceal his emotions, just as he's never felt compelled to conceal any part of himself.\n\n\"I don't really care what people think about me, to be honest,\" he says. \"At. All.\"\n\nSuch pronouncements -- You can't hurt me! -- typically draw skepticism, and rightfully so. No one drives through life with blackout windows; most of us are affected, in some way or another, by the love and hate we encounter in others. But the more time I spend with Jalen Ramsey, the more I realize he isn't like most people. If legendary cornerback Darrelle Revis was an island on the field, the 23-year-old Jaguar is an island off it, a self-governing state that refuses to engage in diplomacy with the outside world. As a player, his hermetically sealed brain elevates his game to extraordinary heights. As a person, it can make things complicated.\n\nTHE FACT THAT Ramsey is famous at all is a small miracle. He's a cornerback who plays in a tiny market; if he's in the news, it's usually because he's a reliable purveyor of juicy sound bites, often batting back reporters' queries with quotes that are perfectly tailored for aggregation and televised debate. Since he was drafted fifth in 2016, Ramsey has talked a city landfill's worth of trash, the likes of which the league hasn't seen since Steve Smith Sr. hung up his mouthguard. (As a rookie, Ramsey called the legendary wide receiver an \"old man.\")\n\nAs a result, when we meet earlier in the day, at a Logan's Roadhouse in Smyrna, I'm prepared for the second coming of Deion Sanders. But Ramsey rolls in quietly, his longtime girlfriend, Breanna Tate, in tow. I don't know what I expected -- a WWE-style entrance? A Deion-esque ensemble? -- but this isn't it: He's dressed plainly, in sweats, and he slips wordlessly into a booth. Ramsey brushes a few peanut shells off the table and regards me suspiciously, as though we're lined up across from each other on the field. When I ask him if he likes doing interviews, he scrunches his nose. \"As long as they're not boring,\" he says.\n\nHe grew up less than 10 minutes from here in a modest home where his father, a firefighter, still lives. \"It's hella country,\" he says. \"If you go five minutes any type of way, you're around cows, horses, fields, barns.\" While he talks, Tate studies the menu. She's extremely petite and extremely pregnant. (In late July, she'll give birth to their daughter, Breelyn.) \"I plan on having, like, five kids,\" Ramsey says.\n\nTate sighs. \"I wanted four, he wanted six,\" she says.\n\nRamsey grins. \"The Lord said be fruitful and multiply.\"\n\nThe two attended the same high school; like Ramsey, whose father and older brother played college football, Tate, who ran track at Ole Miss, comes from an athletic family. Her older brother is Golden Tate, a Pro Bowl wide receiver with the Lions. When I ask Ramsey if he's ever matched up against Golden, who is seven years older than he is, he shakes his head. \"Yeah, he wouldn't want that.\"\n\nWould he give you any trouble?\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\nGolden's pretty fast.\n\n\"Not fast enough.\"\n\nTate rolls her eyes and smiles gently, like someone hearing a child tell a knock-knock joke for the ninth time.\n\nRamsey was prone to roughhousing as a boy; his mother, Margie, would panic when she'd pick him up from day care and notice that his arms were covered with bruises from crashing into things. I ask him when he first thought he'd play in the NFL. \"Out the womb,\" he says, cutting into a piece of steak. I laugh. He doesn't.\n\nRamsey's 27-year-old brother, Jamal, thinks Jalen was unusually confident at a young age because he grew up tagging along with him, which forced Jalen to keep up with older boys. He was also relentlessly competitive. \"He's the biggest sore loser,\" says Jamal, a firefighter. \"If you'd beat him at a game, he'd kick you out of his room.\" Whenever Jalen was losing at Monopoly, he says, he would jumble up the paper money and insist that it was impossible to tell who was winning. Jamal laughs. \"I'm surprised he had friends.\"\n\nFew are spared. Recently, Tate tells me, Ramsey was playing basketball with his 9-year-old nephew and the kid's friends. \"He was dunking on them,\" she says. Later, Ramsey's mother stepped onto the court. He dunked on her too.\n\nBy the time Ramsey entered high school, his talent was undeniable, but he was just 5-foot-3. Surely then, I say, he didn't think he was the best player in Tennessee. \"I didn't think -- I was,\" he retorts. Aside from baseball, which he says he lacks the coordination for, he's excelled at every sport he's ever tried. He picked up lacrosse for a season and, once he figured out how to handle the stick, ran circles around the competition. (\"There's not a lot of black people who do it,\" he says, smiling.) He's never tried skating, but if he trained for six months, he says, he could probably crack the NHL.\n\nAt first I thought Ramsey was self-mythologizing. But as he recounts his athletic exploits, it becomes clear that his unshakable confidence stems from lived experience. He's cocky as hell because he's never been humbled by failure. At 5, he was the strongest, fastest kid in his neighborhood. At 10, he was the best football player in the region. At 15 ... You get the idea.\n\nAfter knee surgery and a well-timed growth spurt, Ramsey was widely recruited, ultimately landing at Florida State. He started from day one, the first Florida State cornerback to start as a true freshman since Sanders. \"I expected to, and Coach [Jeremy] Pruitt expected me to,\" he says of his defensive coordinator. \"Nobody else did.\" The obvious omission is former head coach Jimbo Fisher, now at Texas A&M. In February, when an A&M assistant tweeted a graphic touting Fisher's record with defensive backs, Ramsey clapped back online: \"He didn't teach me not one DB technique ...\"\n\nRamsey describes Fisher, with uncharacteristic brevity, as \"OK.\" I tell him I've never met the coach. \"You're not missing out,\" he replies. During Ramsey's sophomore year, Fisher once reamed him out after he pushed a blocker into quarterback Jameis Winston, kicking him out of practice. When I bring up the incident, Ramsey starts fiddling with his phone. \"Here it is -- I've got the video,\" he says. He also saved a screenshot of the SportsCenter news alert.\n\nFSU's defensive coordinator that year, Charles Kelly, now works on Pruitt's staff at Tennessee, coaching special teams and safeties. He downplays Ramsey's ejection (\"He was competing on a play -- he doesn't know but one speed\") and says Ramsey's personality was perfect for his position. \"You've got to be the most mentally tough person on the field,\" he says. \"If you make a mistake, everybody in the stands knows it.\" Great cornerbacks, Kelly says, have big egos and short memories; they possess a singular ability to block out noise.\n\nIn other words: They think like Jalen Ramsey.\n\nBY THE TIME we drive to Sonic, the humidity is stifling, but we sit outside anyway. \"This was our spot in high school after every game, every track meet,\" Ramsey says. After inhaling his slush, he orders a pony-keg-sized cookie dough milkshake for himself and some ice for Tate to chew on. When I speculate that he's consuming extra calories to support her pregnancy, he laughs. \"I'm pregnant too!\" he says.\n\nI ask Ramsey what he did to piss off A.J. Green. Last season, when the Jaguars were playing the Bengals, the cornerback buzzed around the famously soft-spoken wide receiver like a 6-1 mosquito, jawing away for the better part of the first half. Then, with less than 20 seconds left, Green snapped; after Ramsey shoved him, he whipped around and attacked the younger player, punching him in the head like an aggrieved older brother. Both players were ejected.\n\n\"I called him soft, called him a punk,\" Ramsey says. \"Talked to him. Said whatever I wanted to say. Did whatever I wanted to do.\" He snorts. \"Receivers are, like, naturally soft. So sensitive.\"\n\nOn the field, Ramsey seems driven purely by his id, but there's a method to the madness he provokes. \"It gets them out of their game, and it gets me into my game more. If I'm talking smack, I gotta back it up.\" He claims he largely avoids personal insults (in college, he used to sift through Instagram for opposition research on receivers' significant others), instead providing running commentary on the game -- mocking poorly run routes and QB preferences, sort of like a disrespectful Cris Collinsworth. \"That gets under people's skin more than anything,\" he says. \"I'm not clowning -- I'm talking facts. Yelling out their stats.\"\n\nHow do you monitor their statistics during the game?\n\n\"It's easy to keep track of, like, one catch for 6 yards,\" he says. (Later, I check the box score from the Bengals game. Green had ... one catch for 6 yards.)\n\nWhen pressed, Ramsey doles out praise as gamely as insults. He's a fan of Antonio Brown -- \"He's easily the best receiver in the NFL. Easily,\" he says -- and DeAndre Hopkins. \"He's had freaking 100 quarterbacks -- all trash,\" he says. \"I could be his quarterback. I could literally be his quarterback.\" When Ramsey says \"literally,\" his drawl seeps into the word and it expands like a sponge: \"liiiiht-er-uh-ly.\" (Hopkins returns the praise, calling Ramsey one of the best defensive players in the league. He adds, smiling: \"He's probably the most talkative cornerback in the NFL.\")\n\nIn general, Ramsey continues, fans underestimate the effect that quarterback play has on wide receivers. For example, he says, look at Danny Amendola, who just signed with Miami. \"Or is it Edelman?\" he asks out loud. He mulls it over. No -- he's thinking of Amendola. \"He just got a brand-new contract and he is terrible,\" he says. \"People think he's so great. No, he's not. Tom [Brady] made him look good. Tom could take me as a receiver and I'd be a first-team All-Pro.\"\n\nWhen I mention that the Patriots still have All-Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski, he makes a face. \"I don't think Gronk's good.\" Registering my involuntary blinking, he course-corrects. \"Let me say -- I don't think Gronk is as great as people think he is.\" Before the Patriots game, he explains, he had the Jaguars' analytics staffers pull some numbers for him. \"Any time Gronk has been matched up with a corner, he's had a very bad game -- and that corner has had a very good game.\" (Gronk has performed much better when lined up in the slot than he has on the perimeter, where he's more likely to encounter elite corners -- his catch rate drops from 71 percent to 56 percent, which is lower than that of the average NFL tight end.)\n\nI ask him what Gronk did in the AFC championship. \"Literally nothing. He may have had, like, one catch,\" he says. (Ramsey is correct, though Gronkowski left before halftime because of a concussion.)\n\nNFL players spend their Sundays trying to grind their opponents' bones into dust, but if you corner them during the week, they're typically wary of putting those adversaries on blast. The reasons for this omert\u00e0 are complex. Some don't want to risk awkward locker room encounters; every foe on the field could be a teammate next season. Others are wary of setting themselves up for public humiliation. Ramsey couldn't care less. He throws shade because it's what he believes; if it motivates a disgruntled quarterback to pass in his direction, well, that would be delightful! (At one point, I ask him what he'd like to improve about his game, and he tells me he can't identify an obvious flaw. \"If I had to pick one thing,\" he says, \"I would definitely pick, um, getting the ball more.\")\n\nFor all the hand-wringing that ensues when someone like Ramsey calls out a rival, the consequences are trivial -- unless they're provoked by friendly fire. Criticizing teammates and coaches in public is a locker room third rail, one Ramsey has touched a few times. As a rookie, he told reporters he thought Jaguars coach Gus Bradley ran an overly simplistic scheme. He sticks by that, though he says he loved Bradley, now the defensive coordinator with the Chargers. \"We were just too young and immature for him.\"\n\nAt first, Ramsey was happy to land in Jacksonville, even though he expected Dallas to take him with the No. 4 pick. (He believes that the Cowboys' coaches wanted him but that owner Jerry Jones bigfooted them and grabbed running back Ezekiel Elliott. \"I will never play for them,\" he sniffs, \"unless the Joneses leave.\") But for much of that 3-13 season, he was miserable. \"I wasn't expecting to come into the NFL and essentially be the best person on my team,\" he says. \"This is going to sound really bad, but ... I didn't like that team. They were so used to losing. It didn't affect them.\"\n\nThat offseason, Jacksonville laid the groundwork for a turnaround. The team signed defensive lineman Calais Campbell and also snagged defensive backs A.J. Bouye and Barry Church. Ramsey was thrilled. In Bouye, he says, he finally found a counterpart; the two players spent Thursday nights together at the veteran's house, watching football and exchanging tips. The Jaguars finished 10-6, winning their first division championship in 18 years. But Ramsey wasn't satisfied. \"We gotta get it this year -- because next year, we can't keep all those defensive linemen,\" he says. He tells me he was surprised the team didn't make more moves to bolster the offense. He also thinks the team should've taken a flier on a rookie quarterback.\n\nAnd there it is again: the third rail. The Jaguars, of course, already have a quarterback, the oft-disparaged Blake Bortles. (Last summer Ramsey liked an Instagram post referencing a story by SB Nation blog Big Cat Country that listed possible replacements under center, stirring up a thimble-sized controversy.) When I ask Ramsey if he believes Bortles can win a Super Bowl, he pooh-poohs the question. \"He doesn't need to,\" he says. By his estimation, the team is strong enough as a whole to go all the way. \"The Jaguars can win a Super Bowl with Blake Bortles at quarterback,\" he says.\n\nAnd besides: He likes Bortles! He just believes that, contrary to NFL orthodoxy (as it applies to players), criticism and respect aren't mutually exclusive. And while he says Bortles is a little \"too chill\" compared with the swaggering defense, he thinks that started to change last season. Ramsey points to a moment in the Bengals game when Bortles clashed with Jacksonville's coach, Doug Marrone, over whether to run a play or kneel when the team was up by three scores. \"The players liked it,\" he says, grinning.\n\nAnyone who's ever been part of a team knows there is danger in radical honesty -- that it invites not only hurt feelings but increased scrutiny. But running back Leonard Fournette, who remembers that same moment fondly, says players respect Ramsey because he's unafraid to share his opinions face-to-face. And because, well, he's really good. \"It'd be another thing if he talked trash and didn't back it up,\" Fournette says. \"He's a dog. That's who he is.\"\n\nLater in the summer, I ask Marrone how he views the cornerback's candor. He says that as with any player, he wants Ramsey to learn from his mistakes -- but that he doesn't want him to conform for conformity's sake. \"I don't like coaching that way,\" he says. Marrone also notes that trash-talk is hardly a cardinal sin -- and that Ramsey's takes are often born from preparation. \"Before every game, I'll say: 'Tell me about the receiver you're going up against,'\" he says. \"He's as thorough as anyone I've ever been around.\"\n\nIt's debatable whether Ramsey's bluntness helps or hinders his team. But it's undeniably positive for the NFL. Hollywood is littered with antiheroes, characters who are subversive, impolite and far more watchable than their bland good-guy counterparts. At one point in our conversation, Ramsey mentions that he loved \"Black Panther\" but says he couldn't relate to the main character. \"I'm Killmonger,\" he says, the movie's villain whose charismatic performance steals the show. It's a role he's come to accept, because for him it isn't a role at all. \"A lot of people are gonna hate me before they like me,\" he says. \"I'm perfectly fine with that.\"\n\nAFTER RAMSEY FINISHES his milkshake, I ask him if I can meet his father. He grabs his phone and calls Lamont, who tells us we can come over as long as we leave before his clients arrive. (He's trained a number of local stars, including Eagles pass rusher Derek Barnett.) When we pull up to the Ramseys' brick house, the garage door is already open, revealing a small collection of weight machines. The man known as Big L ambles outside. Like Jalen, he's tall and built. He's also surprisingly subdued. Based on what I had heard, I expected to meet the second coming of LaVar Ball. But Lamont just seems eager to get back to work.\n\nWe sit on benches in the garage. At first, Lamont tells me, he trained only his two sons, \"but they were better than everybody else, so everybody wanted to start doing things.\" Jalen started working out before he began elementary school, doing pushups on his twiggy arms. By the time he was a teenager, he was training three times a week -- after football practice. \"Most high schoolers don't work like that,\" Lamont says.\n\nWhile most of Ramsey's coaches would probably prefer he keep his mouth shut, they tolerate his chatter because of his talent -- and because of a work ethic that's the stuff of legend among scouts. When the doctor who performed his knee surgery told him it would take a year to recover, the high school sophomore rehabbed twice a day, skipping parties so he could get back on the field in six months. \"He still doesn't go to parties,\" Tate says. Now, instead of spending his summers in Miami or LA, Ramsey returns to this garage in Smyrna, running the nearby hills in a weighted vest.\n\n\"We've got guys who say they want to make it to college, and they don't want to do that,\" Lamont says.\n\n\u0093A lot of people are gonna hate me before they like me. I'm perfectly fine with that.\u0094\n\n- Jalen Ramsey\n\nI ask him if his son was as confident as a boy as he is as an adult. \"Yes -- and he verbally let you know it,\" he says. When Jalen was 5, he would tell Lamont how many touchdowns he'd score before every game (and usually deliver). Big L loved it. \"If you don't think you're the best, nobody else is going to think you're the best,\" he says. Ramsey, who is standing a few feet away and listening, smiles; it's obviously not the first time he's heard those words. When I ask Lamont what he thinks he is the best at, he infuses his response with a honeyed drawl that instantly reminds me of his son:\n\n\"Every-thaaaaang.\"\n\nJalen makes a face. \"Ask him if I beat him in bowling.\"\n\n\"When did you beat me in bowling?\" Lamont asks.\n\n\"Ever since I was a little kid.\"\n\nHis father snorts. He starts scrolling through the photos on his phone. \"I beat my friend so bad ... the guy at the counter gave me a trophy. He saw how bad I was beating everybody.\" He hands me the phone. I nod, affirming that a picture of the trophy exists.\n\n\"Dude, this is fake news,\" Jalen says.\n\n\"Pictures don't lie!\" Lamont screams.\n\nJalen grabs the phone and zooms in on the photo, squealing when he sees the script on the trophy. \"Thank you for celebrating your birthday at King Bowl,\" he reads.\n\n\"It was not my birthday,\" Lamont says.\n\n\"It says nothing about being good!\" yells his son.\n\nThis continues for several minutes. Jalen and Lamont go back and forth, like boxers trading jabs with no intention of hurting each other. Old softball games and cornhole matches are brought up. Family rivalries are rehashed. At one point, I close my eyes and I can't tell the difference between the two men's voices.\n\nThen, just when the debate hits a crescendo, a couple of young men in athletic gear -- Lamont's clients -- trickle into the garage. He turns to me and shakes my hand. \"It was nice meeting you,\" he says, standing up. \"Y'all don't gotta go home ... but you gotta get the hell out of here.\"\n\nWHEN RAMSEY MEETS me a few hours later at a competitive driving range (his suggestion), he has changed clothes: He's still wearing sweats, but he's got a diamond-encrusted Rolex on his wrist and animal print Nikes on his feet. He buys pizza and wings for the group, then grabs a club. \"I'm just showing off,\" he jokes, hacking at balls as they roll onto the turf. At one point he whiffs on a massive cut, then whirls around to see if anyone noticed.\n\nAlong with Ramsey's manager, girlfriend and a couple of family friends, his mother is sitting with us. A lithe, graceful woman, Margie is as soft-spoken as her son is loud; when we chat, I have to lean in to hear her above the music. \"Jalen wasn't your typical boy,\" she says while watching the cornerback perform what appears to be a Happy Gilmore impression. \"He was your typical boy times 10.\"\n\nLike most of Ramsey's loved ones, Margie is quick to point out that her son's tough exterior belies a tender spirit. \"He's so worried about me being happy,\" she whispers after he checks on us for maybe the 10th time to see if we need anything. (Ramsey's tender spirit has its limits; later that night, he posts an Instagram story of the final score that shows me finishing in last place.) \"He's always wanted to make everybody else happy.\"\n\nAmong family and friends, Margie says, Ramsey's empathy -- and sensitivity -- shines through. \"He's gonna kill me, but ... he's not afraid to show emotion,\" she says.\n\nI already know this, of course. Along with millions of football fans, I've seen Ramsey cry. I've also heard him explain why he doesn't regret those tears. At a moment when being a star means presenting a carefully manicured image to the world, Ramsey, in all of his s--t-talking, weeping, self-aggrandizing glory, allows us to see him without a filter. It's an approach that doesn't always make things easy for him or the people around him, but it's served him well on the field. \"I like to win my own way, and I like to lose my own way,\" he says. \"I believe motivation comes from within.\"\n\nFor example: When I ask if he wants revenge on the Patriots after Jacksonville blew a lead in the AFC championship last season, he scoffs. Like many Jaguars fans, Ramsey believes the refs were biased (\"It was clear as day they wanted them to win,\" he says) and Myles Jack should have been allowed to keep running after he recovered a fumble (\"He wasn't down\"). But he also thinks his team deserved to lose after softening its game plan in the second half. \"People say, 'Y'all should use that as motivation.' No, we shouldn't,\" he says. \"Why should we use it as motivation when we were up on a team and then we -- and the refs -- let them get back into the game?\"\n\nWhile Margie is taking a turn at the tee, Ramsey downs his second strawberry lemonade. He tells me that he likes the Jaguars organization and its owner, Shahid Khan. Last year Ramsey knelt alongside some of his teammates during the national anthem, hoping to call attention to racial injustice. (Throughout preseason this year, Ramsey stayed in the locker room during the anthem.) Looking back, he says, Khan, who locked arms with the standing players, treated the team with respect. \"He's the owner who's like, 'These are grown men. We're gonna let them make educated decisions,'\" he says.\n\nRamsey says he'd like to retire a Jaguar. He's building a five-bedroom house near the marsh in Jacksonville -- a home for his growing family. I ask him whether he thinks he'll be the best father in the world, and, for once, he says no. \"I'm gonna try to be,\" he says. \"I can just try.\" He says he wants to build generational wealth so that his children can do what they love, just like their dad. He doesn't see football as a job. \"Even if I wasn't being paid, I'd still want to do it,\" he explains. \"It's my dream.\"\n\nWhat do you like most about the game?\n\nHe sighs. \"Literally everything.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, he expects to retire as the best cornerback to ever play the game -- better than Sanders, he says, even if some fans refuse to acknowledge it. \"But people who know the game of football -- truly know the game of football -- they'll look back and be like: This dude,\" he says.\n\nI ask him what he expects out of this season. \"A Super Bowl,\" he replies, before bursting into laughter. Sensing my confusion, he smiles. \"You knew I was gonna say that,\" he says. Minutes later, his mother informs him that it's his turn to hit, so he leaps out of his seat and grabs a club, pointing it at the group. \"Regard the winner!\" he tells us, his grin as incandescent as the skylights behind him. One of his friends points out that the game isn't over. Ramsey doesn't really care.\n\nMina KimesKimes is a senior writer for ESPN.",

    "authors": [],
    "raw_text": "Editor's note: On the two-year anniversary of the Chapecoense tragedy, ESPN is reposting the article, along with an extended epilogue below that offers updates on what has happened to the main characters in the story during the days, weeks and months since the club, and its city, was stricken by a shocking -- and seemingly preventable -- tragedy.\n\nThere is rain in Chiquinho's pockets. Rain running down his shoulders. Rain squishing through his shoes. The rain is so loud he barely hears the music. The rain is so thick he barely sees the coffins.\n\nChiquinho tries to focus. He has a job. He is the groundskeeper. He takes care of the undersoil and the topsoil. He takes care of the field. This stadium is his home. The members of the club are his friends.\n\nOne of the goalkeepers, Danilo, used to joke with Chiquinho about the bare patch down at the end of the field. All that mowing and feeding and watering in the warm Brazilian sun, and Chiquinho still couldn't get grass to grow there. \"Where is the grass?\" Danilo would ask with a sparkle in his eyes, and Chiquinho's leathery face would crinkle.\n\nOne of the team's trainers, Anderson Paix\u00e3o, used to talk with Chiquinho about the stray dog Chiquinho found lying outside the gates one morning a few years back. The dog was hurt and whimpering -- a boy nearby said he thought it might have been hit by a car -- and Chiquinho and his crew took it in. They gave the dog dried meat and bought it medicine. They rubbed its belly and cleaned its black fur. They got it a leash and built it a tiny house out near the shed with the rakes. They named it Pitico, which is Portuguese for \"something little.\"\n\nBefore training, Paix\u00e3o would pet Pitico and wrestle Pitico and kick soccer balls for Pitico, like a game of fetch, except Pitico would skip right past the balls because he was more interested in chasing the birds swooping low near the sidewalls. Pitico would nuzzle Paix\u00e3o, and Paix\u00e3o would giggle, and Chiquinho, watching from the side, would take pictures on his phone that he could look at during his long bus ride home every night around dusk. Chiquinho took pictures of the players before each game, too.\n\nBut now Pitico is missing. And Paix\u00e3o, Chiquinho's friend, is in a box coming toward him, and Danilo is in one, too, and the water that has been running off Chiquinho's neck all day is suddenly rising through the grass on the field like a bathtub with the stopper dropped in. Big puddles are forming, and water is splashing everywhere, and Chiquinho the groundskeeper is scared.\n\nThere are tens of thousands of people watching Brazilian servicemen carry in one coffin after another. The coffins are heavy. What if a soldier carrying Danilo or Paix\u00e3o slips? What if a coffin gets covered in mud?\n\nChiquinho cannot allow this. There are 50 coffins today. Fifty. And it is Chiquinho's field. He even laid out the floral wreaths and tied the bunting through the holes in the metal fences. He doesn't know anything about flowers or colors or bunting, but he wanted to make it nice. He wanted it to be respectful. He knows the coffins must stay dry. He has to fix the flooding.\n\nAs the processional continues, he runs toward the end of the stadium. There must be a blockage. One of the drain pipes again. He bows his shoulders and slides into the concrete bunker under the stands where all the pipes snake together. It is quiet in there: Nothing is draining.\n\nChiquinho bangs on a pipe, testing to see if he can hear which valve is stopped up. He bangs on another and another, twisting and whirling around to test as many as he can. He can't figure out which one is jammed. He slams the pipes with his hand. His cheeks are wet.\n\nHe has no choice. Chiquinho takes a saw and begins hacking. He cuts through one pipe and a second and a third, destroying the drainage system. He cuts another pipe. And another. And another. His blade flails in all directions.\n\nFinally, Chiquinho cuts the right pipe. Gunky water gushes everywhere. His pants and shirt are sopping. Chiquinho stumbles out of the bunker and back onto the field. The pooling in the grass begins to ebb. He exhales.\n\nThen he straightens up and stands at attention, clutching the saw in his fist. He stares as the rest of the coffins are carried in. Everyone else in the arena watches, too. Some watch the military men. Some watch the widows or the mothers or the fathers who scream and hold each other through plastic ponchos. Some watch the children, who fidget and fuss and might or might not understand exactly why an entire city in the interior of Brazil has come together at a soccer stadium to mourn in the rain.\n\nChiquinho just watches all the feet. He cannot help it. He is praying no one slips.\n\nChampions Forever\n\nIt is Nov. 23, 2016 -- 10 days earlier. It is hot and dry. The winds are calm. The sunlight glints off the stained glass of the Santo Antonio Cathedral that sits up high on one of the hills. The rain feels far away.\n\nAs afternoon shades toward evening, the people of Chapec\u00f3 crowd the streets wearing green and white. Vendors set up carts selling water and beer. Fans park their cars and lean against the open trunks. More than 800 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro, this dusty city known for its slaughterhouses and its farmland is preparing for the most important soccer game in its history.\n\nInside the stadium, Chiquinho waters the grass constantly in temperatures that rise toward 90 degrees. Down the street, at the Hotel Bertaso, the players of Chapecoense, which everyone just shortens to Chape (CHAH-pay), compose themselves. Before every home game, the players spend the night in this hotel together in \"concentration.\" They go over tactics and scouting. They talk about formations and strategy. Then, when they are done with all that, they pass the time.\n\nThe hotel gives the team the entire second floor, and the players spread out. Danilo, the goalkeeper with the kind eyes, is chatty. Kempes, the striker with the frizzy Afro, plays his pandeiro, which is a tambourine. Tiaguinho, a young winger with a dimple, cannot put down his phone.\n\nThe mood is buoyant. The game tonight is against San Lorenzo, a team from Argentina, and it is the second leg of a two-match semifinal in the Copa Sudamericana, the South American Cup. In the first match of the aggregate series, in Buenos Aires, the teams tied 1-1. Tonight, all Chape needs to do is tie 0-0 because the tiebreaker in this tournament is goals scored in the opponent's stadium. If Chape advances, it will go to the final of one of the continent's most important tournaments. For a team from a city like Chapec\u00f3, a team that was founded in 1973 and was in the lowest division in Brazil as recently as 2009, it is fantasy.\n\nStart Your Sunday With A Story\n\nE:60 showcases the best in longform television journalism, including Setenta Sete, a one-hour documentary on the Chapecoense tragedy. The episode airs Tuesday at 9 a.m. ET and 11 p.m. ET on ESPNEWS.\n\nWant to listen to Eternal Champions on the go? Here's the audio version \u00bb\n\nThe players get ready to leave for the stadium, but Tiaguinho cannot stop texting his wife, Graziele. She is only 19, but they grew up in the same town and have been in love for years, ever since the day Tiaguinho sat next to her on a bench in grade school and showed her his arm. He had written her name on it in marker, over and over from elbow to wrist. He said, \"See how much I like you?\" and she laughed.\n\nA day earlier, not long after the players arrived at the hotel to begin concentration, Tiaguinho was sitting in the hall outside his room. Two teammates, Matheus Biteco and Caramelo, approached him. \"We have a present for you,\" they told him, and Biteco gave him a gift bag. Tiaguinho took the bag and looked up at them, wary.\n\n\"It is from a female fan who likes you,\" Biteco said, and Tiaguinho dropped the bag like it was on fire. He did not want his friends to see him interested in anyone but Graziele. \"Just open it, man,\" Caramelo said, nudging it back, and Tiaguinho grudgingly pulled out a tiny box with a shiny ribbon and card. His eyes went wide. It was from Graziele.\n\nTiaguinho furrowed his brow. He opened the card and read it slowly, tracing his finger over some of the words. Then he closed it, took a deep breath and opened it again. Biteco leaned in, hovering over his friend, and Tiaguinho shot up from the floor, shouting and dancing and hugging everyone around him. He showed them what was inside the box: tiny shoes. Then he rocked an imaginary baby in his arms while his teammates howled.\n\nSince that moment, Tiaguinho has been floating. Even now, just hours before this match against San Lorenzo, he is texting Graziele about names. They both like Maite for a girl; it means \"beloved.\" For a boy, Tiaguino pushes for Santiago, which is a family name. Finally, his teammates tell him it is time to go. He cannot resist and texts once more, telling Graziele that he loves her.\n\nThe game begins around 7. Arena Cond\u00e1 thrums. The fans chant and cheer and sing, standing together on the concrete bleachers or crowding up against the fence that separates the walkway from the team benches. In the press box, Chape's radio play-by-play announcer, Rafael Henzel, holds up his phone to take a video of the energy just before kickoff even as he narrates the action live.\n\nRafael is 43, with a flat face and thin hair and glasses. He works with several other announcers, including his partner, Renan Agnolin, but he is the team's voice. He has been coming to Chape games since he was a little boy. As a child, he would arrive at the arena with no money and wait outside the gates. Once everyone had gone in and the game started, he could find an entrance that was unattended and slip in for free. He cheered for the team when it was still playing in the amateur leagues. He became a broadcaster when he was 15. When Chape finally reached Brazil's top division in 2013, he cried in his radio booth.\n\nTonight, with a place in the final at stake, Rafael is even more dynamic than usual. The Chape players know what they have to do: just avoid conceding a goal. They do not need to score, and San Lorenzo's players are more talented anyway. San Lorenzo has three players who played in England's Premier League. It has a regular for Argentina's national team. It has players who play for Uruguay and Paraguay.\n\nChape has only the one away goal it scored in the first game that it wants to protect.\n\nAfter the first 15 minutes, the Chape players -- and the crowd -- grow more confident. Danilo dives to his left to push away a shot, and the fans erupt. Dener, a midfielder, flicks the ball over his head to elude an opponent, and the spectators shout a mocking \"oh!\" as the San Lorenzo player gives chase.\n\nChape occasionally presses forward in attack, and there is one sequence, about half an hour into the game, when Chape nearly scores. A free kick comes in, and Willian Thiego, a stout central defender, lashes the ball into the goal. He turns away to celebrate, wanting desperately to share the emotion with his teammates on the bench. He does not see the offside flag raised. When he does, he stops his gyrations midjiggle, shakes his head and runs back up the field.\n\nMostly, Chape just defends. A San Lorenzo player's header hits the post and bounces out. Danilo slides out quickly to block a shot. A long-range blast goes wide.\n\nThe minutes creep by. Seventy. Eighty. Eighty-five. Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine. It is still 0-0. The fans are frothing as it appears Chape will do it. The stadium is shaking. With seconds left in injury time, San Lorenzo gets a free kick and lofts the ball toward Chape's goal. Even with all the defenders there, it ricochets around and falls at the feet of Marcos Angeleri, an experienced Argentine. Angeleri is directly in front of the goal, 18 feet away. All he has to do is shoot the ball into the net, which is 24 feet wide, and San Lorenzo will steal the game, go to the final and keep Chape home. Danilo, the goalkeeper, looks helpless. Rafael, in the radio booth, puts his hands to his head. He fears the worst: At the last breath, Chape will lose.\n\nBut as Angeleri prepares to shoot, Danilo rises up like a lion on its back legs. And somehow, with his right foot splayed sideways, he blocks Angeleri's blast from close range. For a beat, it is as if the fans cannot fathom what has happened. But then the roar is long and loud, and Danilo thumps his chest with glee.\n\nRafael, in his radio booth, calls out Danilo's name, over and over. Except he changes it. Instead of saying \"Danilo!\" he wails, \"Deus-nilo! Deus-nilo! Deus-nilo!\" When the referee blows the whistle to end the game and officially send Chape to the final, he bellows it once more. \"Deus-nilo! Deus-nilo! Deus-nilo!\"\n\nIn Portuguese, \"Deus\" is the word for God.\n\nThe celebration begins in the hot and sticky locker room. The players form a circle and scream out the team song, the one the fans sing whenever something good happens or something bad happens or, really, anything happens: \"Ohhhhhh! Vamos-vamos-Cha-pay! Vamos-vamos-Cha-pay! Vamos-Vamos-Cha-paaaa-Aay!\"\n\nThey are delirious. Ananias, an attacking midfielder, jumps up and down on the seat in front of his cubby. Bruno Rangel, the team's leading scorer, is shirtless and claps his hands over his head. S\u00e9rgio Manoel, one of the only players still wearing his full uniform, dances through the middle of it all. Jackson Follmann, the backup goalkeeper, bangs his hands against the frame of his locker. Even the mayor of Chapec\u00f3, Luciano Buligon, holds a paper cup and shouts along.\n\nThe party moves to Spettus, a restaurant in town where the team often goes. Paix\u00e3o, the trainer, has a cavaquinho, or a four-string guitar. William Thiego has a surdo, which is a large Brazilian bass drum. Waiters circulate, cutting thick slices of sirloin from towering skewers. The players relive the match. There is a toast to Danilo for his miraculous save. The wives and girlfriends sit together and talk about how they have never seen their men like this.\n\nThe women of Chape are close. The men are always playing or training or in concentration before they play again, so genuine friendships among the women are natural. When Graziele received the results of her pregnancy test -- before she surprised Tiaguinho with the news -- she went with Geisa, who is Caramelo's wife, and Val, who is married to the defensive midfielder Gil. They had not known each other long, but when the results came back positive, the women hugged Graziele and congratulated her and told her she was so young to be having a baby.\n\nAt Spettus, the women talk about the future. About the championship game, yes, but only a little bit. They talk about Graziele's baby and about a trip that many of the families are planning to take to the Dominican Republic after the season. They talk about bathing suits and how they will go to the beach together. They talk about relaxing.\n\nAline Machado joins in but cannot stop looking at her husband, Filipe. He has never been this happy, not when he was playing in Iran or the Middle East or for other clubs in Brazil. Not even when he was making good money. \"He looks fulfilled,\" she says to one of her friends.\n\nOver the next few days, nothing changes. In the morning, Filipe leaves a love note for Aline on a napkin in the kitchen. When he begins packing for the trip to S\u00e3o Paulo, where Chape will play a Brazilian league game and then, from there, go to Medell\u00edn, Colombia, for the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final, Filipe puts their 2-year-old daughter, Antonella, up on top of the suitcase as he wheels it around the apartment.\n\nAntonella squeals and grabs her father's arms. Filipe and Aline talk about the team and the winning and the trip to the Dominican Republic and about Antonella's love of the problem-solving dogs on the TV cartoon \"Paw Patrol.\" As Filipe is about to leave, Aline kisses him and tells him, \"Go now, go and take this moment.\"\n\nAt Tiaguinho and Graziele's apartment, Tiaguinho puts his bag down by the door and caresses Graziele's belly. At their wedding, she wore a sleek white gown with a floor-length veil and a headband with crystal butterflies on it and looked like a princess. Now, she tells him she hopes she will start having strange cravings soon, like pickles or sausage, instead of just feeling nauseous all the time. He hugs her and talks to the baby, telling it he is going to teach it how to play soccer and take it onto the field with him before a big game someday. Tiaguinho nuzzles Graziele's stomach before he walks out the door and says, \"Love, take care of our little baby.\"\n\nAlan Ruschel, a left back for Chape, has a more frenetic departure. A misplaced passport leaves him and his fianc\u00e9e, Marina, scrambling, and Marina is worried it is some sort of sign, a harbinger about her fianc\u00e9's chance to play well in an important final. But the passport is found, and Alan can leave, and Marina feels an exaggerated sensation of comfort and calm come over her when she is in the shower the next morning. It is an unusual feeling for her; she likes energy and pace. She was in beauty pageants when she was younger and sometimes wears a nose ring and highlights her hair lighter or darker depending on her particular mood. She is working on designing her own clothing line and likes walking the couple's dog, even though the dog has an affinity for chewing everything from shoes to furniture.\n\nShe is not used to serenity. She tells Alan about this feeling, and he chuckles at her. \"What do you think it means?\" he asks, and she hesitates. She cannot place the sensation; she only knows it makes her feel warm. \"I think something very good is going to happen to you,\" she says finally. \"I think maybe you are going to score a goal.\"\n\nThe flight to Medell\u00edn takes off at 6:18 p.m. local time. It is delayed slightly because one of the players asks, just as the doors are closing, whether he can get his bag back from the luggage hold. He left his video-game player inside. Many jokes are made, but the bag is retrieved.\n\nIt is retrieved because this is a charter flight operated by LaMia airlines and not a regular commercial flight. LaMia is a Bolivian company that has flown many other soccer clubs to important games. Just a few weeks ago, on the same plane, it flew Lionel Messi and the Argentine national team to a World Cup qualifier. A Bolivian airline cannot legally operate a flight from Brazil to Colombia, so the Chape traveling party first takes a commercial flight from S\u00e3o Paulo (where the team loses 1-0 to Palmieras in that Brazilian league game) to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, a Bolivian town. LaMia will then take the team from there to Medell\u00edn for the first match of the Copa Sudamericana final against Atl\u00e9tico Nacional.\n\nWhile waiting for the flight, Alan Ruschel does magic tricks. He correctly guesses which card a teammate picks from the deck and makes a card disappear right in front of everyone's eyes. Danilo tries some tricks, too, but he is better as a member of the audience because he gets visibly startled when Alan suddenly makes the card appear again.\n\nEveryone is giddy. A Bolivian television crew does interviews before departure, and one of the flight crew members says to the camera, \"I think we'll return with good results.\" Kempes, the striker, gestures to the crew member and grins, saying, \"Everything is fine, because he is in charge.\" The team used LaMia for a trip earlier in the Copa Sudamericana, and Caio J\u00fanior, the head coach, tells the interviewer that traveling via Bolivia \"gives us good luck.\"\n\nOnce in the air, the players deal cards and play Samba. One of the staff members tries to teach a flight attendant Portuguese. Caio J\u00fanior sits up front with most of the coaches. Kempes sits on the right side by a window. Two rows from the back, Rafael Henzel sits in a middle seat among the other journalists. Alan sits next to Follmann, the backup goalkeeper, in the center of the plane; Alan was originally in the rear but moved up when the journalists gathered there. Follmann grabbed him and pulled him into his row.\n\nThe flight is long. Some players eat. Some doze. Some keep their headphones on the entire time. At about 9:30 p.m. local time, the plane begins its descent. A different aircraft, flying from Bogota to San Andres, has just been diverted to Medell\u00edn because of a mechanical issue, so Chape's flight is directed into a holding pattern. At 9:49 p.m., the pilot on Chape's flight requests priority to land from the air traffic controller.\n\nIn the cabin, Rafael asks a flight attendant when they will be on the ground. Ten minutes. Ten minutes, he is told. He notices the flight attendant looks worried. At 9:52 p.m., the air traffic controller tells the pilot there is another plane also holding just below them and asks whether they can wait a few more minutes for clearance.\n\nAt 9:53 p.m., one of the four engines on the British-made Avro RJ85 plane fails. Thirteen seconds later, the second engine fails. At 9:55 p.m., the third engine fails. Fourteen seconds after that, the fourth engine fails. The lights in the cabin go out, and the air circulator goes quiet. There is no turbulence or shaking; it feels instead as if the plane is floating toward the ground.\n\nUsing the standard phonetic alphabet to refer to LaMia's call letters of LMI, the pilot shouts into his radio at the female air traffic controller: \"Se\u00f1orita, Lima Mike India 2933 is in total failure!\"\n\nAbout 30 seconds later, the pilot calls again: \"Lima Mike India, vectors! Vectors, se\u00f1orita! Vectors to the runway!\"\n\nHe is asking for directions. The controller answers that the plane has disappeared from her radar. She tries to guide the pilot toward the runway anyway and asks for the plane's altitude. The pilot shouts, \"9,000 feet, se\u00f1orita. Vectors, vectors!\" The controller tells the pilot how far the plane is from the runway. There is a pause. Then the controller hears the word, \"Jesus,\" over the radio. She asks again for the pilot to call his altitude, and the radio is silent.\n\nAt 9:59 p.m. local time on Nov. 28, the Chape flight, traveling at about 150 miles per hour, crashes into Cerro Gordo, a mountain with an elevation of 8,500 feet. On impact, the plane shears into two pieces. The tail embeds on the south side of the crest. The nose shoots over the edge and finishes on the north side, nearly 500 feet away. One of the engines catches in the branches of an uprooted tree. There is no explosion, no fire at the site; only twisted metal and debris.\n\nThe temperature at Cerro Gordo is 66 degrees. There are cloudy skies and thunder in the distance. It is, by most measures, an unremarkable night in Colombia. After traveling four hours and roughly 1,800 miles, Chape's plane plunges to the ground just 11 miles from the runway at Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport outside Medell\u00edn.\n\nAline Machado is sleeping, but it is the sleep of a parent with a toddler nearby. When the phone rings in the early morning, she answers it immediately. It is her mother.\n\nAt first, Aline does not understand what her mother is saying. Then she hears the words \"airplane\" and \"Chape.\" Her head starts pounding. She sits up in bed and turns on the television. There are confusing reports about something happening.\n\nShe feels sick. She calls Antonella's nanny to come over so she won't be alone. The text-message group of Chape wives and girlfriends buzzes on her phone over and over. No one knows what is going on. No one knows what to believe. One woman says that someone from Colombia has messaged her on Facebook but that she is not sure if it is reliable. The person says there are no fatalities, that it was just an emergency landing. There is hope. The television and radio voices keep talking but not saying anything for certain. Then the reports begin mentioning \"some\" survivors, and the phone buzzes more.\n\nAline believes Filipe is alive. She believes she can feel him. She has known Filipe since they were children. On their first date, he took her to see pigs. Some of her friends thought it was strange, but she understood. The pigs were at a farm his family owned on the outskirts of Gravata\u00ed, near Porto Alegre. Filipe imagined that someday he would turn the farm into a soccer field for the community. He would build the locker rooms himself. He would put up goals and children would come and play. He would run camps and clinics. It would be his to share.\n\nSo on that first date, when they were just teenagers, Filipe was showing Aline his dream. She felt his passion, his ambition that day. She felt his enthusiasm. And now, in the middle of the night, she still feels it. When the TV says a defender is among the survivors, she is sure it is Filipe. She is sure of it. When the TV says it is Neto, she is happy, because it means one of Filipe's friends survived, too.\n\nShe goes to Rosangela's house. Rosangela is married to Cl\u00e9ber Santana, the captain of the team. Filipe and Cl\u00e9ber Santana are close; when Cl\u00e9ber Santana was substituted late in the game against S\u00e3o Paulo, Filipe took the captain's armband and finished the game as the team's leader.\n\nAline is going to pick up Rosangela, and the two of them will go to the stadium together to wait for more news with the other wives. When Aline comes into Rosangela's living room, the TV is on. Rosangela is sitting there. Aline looks at her and then looks at the TV and hears the reporter say, \"There are no more survivors.\" She stares at the TV for a beat or two or three. Then Aline wails and collapses to the ground.\n\nAfter 20 minutes, Aline and Rosangela collect themselves and go to the stadium. They sit in the locker room with wives and girlfriends and mothers and fathers. Everyone connected to the club has come to the stadium, because no one knows where else to go. Even Chiquinho is there. Graziele is hysterical. Someone says, \"Be strong, Grazi, for the baby.\" A locker room attendant begins to gather the players' clothing, putting things in bags.\n\nIn one corner is Marina. She feels torn. Jacqueline, Val, Susanna, Aline, Rosangela -- they are all crying. Marina is crying, too, but her fianc\u00e9, Alan Ruschel, is alive. The team doctor took Marina aside and told her Alan was in surgery in Colombia. She does not know the details of the surgery, but she knows Alan is alive. She tries to comfort her friends, to hold them and hug them, but they know her partner is not dead like theirs. They know she is not left alone, and, already, it is different.\n\nWhen the man collecting clothes from the lockers comes around to Alan's, Marina stops him. He seems confused. She looks around and tries to whisper. \"No,\" she says under her breath. \"No. Don't take these.\"\n\nRafael Henzel does not know what happened. He does not know where he is, exactly. But he sees lights moving and hears strange voices and tries to call out. \"I'm here!\" he shouts. \"I'm here!\"\n\nHe calls out for his radio colleague, his friend. \"Renan? Renan?\" Renan Agnolin, his partner, was sitting next to him on the plane. But Rafael cannot see him anymore. He calls Renan's name again and again, but there is no answer.\n\nSlowly, Rafael begins to realize there are trees around him. Then he sees faces. There are five or six men. There is a woman. They are talking to him and pulling at his clothes. He yells at them, \"Don't rip my shirt! Don't cut my trousers!\" He is worried he will lose the only change of clothes he has in Colombia. They tell him he is going to be OK, that they are going to help him. One keeps shouting, \"Don't go to sleep, Rafa! Don't go to sleep!\"\n\nRafael does not know he was in the back piece of the plane, the one that plugged in the soft earth on the near side of the mountain. He does not know that the elevation and the fog and the mud made it impossible for helicopters to land at the crash site, and that it took hours before rescue workers could arrive. He does not know that he will be extracted from the site in the back of a pickup truck because ambulances cannot get to him.\n\nOnce he reaches the hospital, he has a vague understanding of what has happened but knows no specifics. He knows the plane crashed, but the doctors do not tell him how many people are dead. He does not know that Alan Ruschel kept asking the doctors, \"Where are my friends?\" as he was wheeled into surgery. He does not know that Follmann, the backup goalkeeper, will have his leg amputated below the knee or that one physician will describe Neto to a television station as \"currently\" alive, because he does not want to be presumptuous. Rafael does not know that Danilo survived the crash and was rescued, only to die at the hospital.\n\nA day later, Rafael's wife arrives and traces her finger over his face, where a tree branch or a piece of wreckage has gouged a wound above his right eye. He has a swollen abdomen from his seven broken ribs and a tube down his throat and is sedated. She looks at him and says, \"I came to get you,\" and his eyes grow moist.\n\nShe wants Rafael to focus on himself, on his own recovery, so she and the doctors tell him the story in stages. Three days after the crash, Rafael learns that there are only a few survivors. No one tells him about exactly how the plane went down. No one tells him that there are so many coffins in the San Vicente funeral home in Medell\u00edn that they have to be kept in the parking garage because there is no room inside. No one tells him that two days of school have been canceled in Chapec\u00f3 and that residents are holding vigils all day at the stadium and that children have written cards and drawn pictures that are piling up outside the gates. No one tells him the city is in mourning.\n\nOn Saturday, five days after the crash, Rafael finally looks at the list, finally reads all the names. That morning, three C-130 Hercules aircraft from the Brazilian Air Force arrive in Chapec\u00f3 with all the bodies. The coffins are loaded onto several open-sided box trucks, a dozen or more in each, and driven from the airport to the stadium. Shrouded in white and wrapped in plastic because of the rain, the coffins are carried in by the soldiers.\n\nChiquinho and his men have set out the flowers and the bunting. They have also left only one set of goalposts on the field -- the one Danilo was guarding when he made the save against San Lorenzo that sent Chape to the final. Danilo's wife places a picture of Danilo in the goalmouth. The godfather of Danilo's son pounds the crossbar with Danilo's gloves. Under the tent, Danilo's mother hugs Filipe's father and whispers, \"Why did he have to make that save in the last minute?\"\n\nThe president of Brazil is there. The FIFA president is there. Nearly 100,000 people, or about half the population of the city, are inside the Arena Cond\u00e1 or directly outside. There is coverage of the memorial all over the world.\n\nThere were 77 people on the plane. Twenty-two were Chapecoense players, and three survived. Twenty-three more were coaches or team staff, and there were two team guests. There were 21 journalists, including Rafael, and there was the flight crew, all of whom perished except for one flight attendant and a maintenance technician. Of the 71 who died, there were 64 Brazilians, five Bolivians, one Venezuelan and one Paraguayan. Fifty coffins come to the memorial in Chapec\u00f3; the rest are flown elsewhere for separate services.\n\nIn the hospital, Rafael does not watch any of the ceremony on television. He does not see the stadium's exterior wrapped in a giant black ribbon. He does not listen to the speeches where the mayor likens the rain to God's tears. He can't bear any of it. It is too fresh. Instead, he just looks at the list, reading the names of his friends over and over.\n\nAline Machado goes to the airport to see Filipe's coffin come off the military plane. Then, she goes to the stadium. She feels strange. She does not want to be around people from Chape, does not want to talk about how the club must be \"for\u00e7a, for\u00e7a,\" or strong in the face of tragedy. Aline does not want to be strong. She is angry.\n\nShe has so many questions, so many things that do not make sense to her. Two stand out: Why did a Brazilian team hire a Bolivian airline to take it to Colombia? And what was the pilot thinking?\n\nFilipe's father, Osmar, is mad, too. Filipe died on Osmar's birthday, and Osmar cannot stop reading news reports about LaMia and the pilot. Within days, he reads that LaMia was a twice-failed Venezuelan airline whose name was sold to Bolivian investors and relaunched in 2015. He learns it had three planes and that only one was operational. He learns the pilot, Miguel Quiroga, was in trouble with the Bolivian air force for leaving his military service early with no explanation. And he learns that Miguel Quiroga was also one of the owners of LaMia.\n\nThis infuriates him. He tells Aline, \"The pilot is a murderer,\" as he hears more and more on television and the radio. Most crashes involve a massive fire because the fuel explodes, but investigators say all the LaMia fuel gauges found in the wreckage were \"below zero\" so there was no fire, no explosion. The official flight plan Quiroga filed is scrutinized, and investigators believe that Quiroga might have underreported the weight of the flight. Also, the maximum flying time before fuel ran out -- 4 hours, 22 minutes -- was listed as the exact same amount of time as the expected trip time, with no safety buffer for things such as circling the arrival airport to let another plane land in front of it.\n\nWhy did the plane crash? Osmar cringes when he says it: It ran out of gas.\n\nThe club makes statements about how LaMia had flown other soccer teams in South America and was reputable. There was only a day or two in between winning the semifinal and leaving for the trip, it says, so the time to make decisions about the travel plans was short. The team had flown with LaMia earlier in the tournament and had been satisfied. It liked the way LaMia put Chape's logo on the plane and on the headrests of the seats. Using a charter airline was more efficient, as well, the club says, because it meant the team could leave right after the game and get back sooner than if it had to wait for a commercial flight the next day.\n\nIt does not add up for Osmar or Aline, and Osmar seethes as he reads about a few other LaMia employees being questioned by Bolivian police. An investigation into the flight controller is underway, too. There is no official word from LaMia yet, but to Osmar it feels so simple: It was about money. Chape flew with LaMia, he tells his family, because it was a little bit cheaper than chartering with Gol or another Brazilian commercial airline. And Quiroga did not stop to refuel when he should have, Osmar says, because it would have taken money out of his own pocket. Quiroga tried to push it to save a little, and so Filipe is dead.\n\nAline talks to a lawyer. There are discussions about lawsuits, about legal action. There are meetings. Some other wives and family members are interested, but many just want to move on, to try to figure out how to put their lives back together without their husband or son or brother.\n\nAline wants to move on, too, but every time she leaves the room, Antonella tenses up. Every time she goes to the store, Antonella cries nervously. At the \"Paw Patrol\" birthday party, Aline will be alone. And at Filipe's farm, the locker room isn't finished, and the grass needs cutting, and the field still needs lines. Every time Aline goes there, to let Antonella run around or to simply look out over the countryside, she feels as if she is looking at a story that ends in the middle of a sentence.\n\nThat is why Aline cannot just move on. And so she keeps talking to the lawyer, keeps asking questions, even though there are no answers. Whenever she tries to ask anyone at the club about what happened, she is told that all the directors at Chape who made the decision to use LaMia were on the plane. She is told that all the directors who made the decision are dead.\n\nFifty-four days after the crash, Rafael Henzel walks back into his radio booth. It is Jan. 21, 2017, and he is wearing a light shirt and hat with a green lanyard holding his credential around his neck. His seven broken ribs are still healing, but his lungs are strong. Before he puts on his headset, he sits in his seat and pauses; he thinks of Renan Agnolin, who was next to him on the plane.\n\nThere is a game today. It is a preseason match, Chape against Palmeiras, the reigning national champions, at Arena Cond\u00e1. The stadium is full. Chiquinho has spent hours on the field, determined to make it a palace. It feels strange -- a new team, a new time -- but Chiquinho wants to make it nice, even if he doesn't know these players. Pitico is missing and hasn't been seen since the tragedy, and Chiquinho wonders whether it is because the dog does not recognize the new players, either.\n\nBefore the match, there is a ceremony. Alan Ruschel and Neto and Follmann come out onto the field. Neto has a scar on the back of his head, his hair shaved away in a patch. Follmann is in a wheelchair, his right stump wrapped in beige dressing. He wears a black neck brace. Alan puts one hand on the back of Follmann's chair and walks gingerly, still stiff and sore after spinal surgery.\n\nThe fans sing and wave paper origami flowers with the club's crest on it. The surviving players join members of their teammates' families in the middle of the field. Atl\u00e9tico Nacional conceded the Copa Sudamericana final to Chape, so the Chape players are now \"campe\u00f5es eternos\" -- eternal champions.\n\nWinners' medals are draped over the necks of widows and children. Many of the wives wear their husband's jersey backward, so that the name is on the front. From his chair, Follmann lifts the trophy through tears. When Barbara, the wife of Ananias, receives his medal, she cries out and raises her hands and points with two fingers to the sky.\n\nThe new players walk out of the tunnel and onto the field. Chape's board has been reconstituted, and a new president has been elected. A new coach, V\u00e1gner Mancini, has been recruited. A new front office is in place, and in six weeks the team has been reconstructed: 25 players signed, a group of coaches brought in and a support staff hired.\n\nSome teams lend players to Chape to help. Some players who played for the team earlier in their careers feel a pull to return. T\u00falio de Melo, a renowned forward, had played briefly for Chape in 2015 and is supposed to play for a team in Qatar in 2017. The salary is big and the destination intriguing. Then he receives a message from his friend Neto while Neto is still in the hospital after the crash. It says, \"The club needs you,\" and T\u00falio de Melo comes to Chape instead.\n\nThe game begins. The fans behind the goal brandish their flags as usual. It feels good to cheer. Palmeiras scores the first goal, but then Chape bends in a free kick, and the ball is nodded across the goalmouth, and Douglas Grolli, a player who grew up in Chape's youth academy and has come back to help it rebuild, nudges it over the line.\n\nThere is a whoosh of energy, as if the whole stadium has welled up together. Some fans scream. Others cry. Many in the stands are wearing tiny earpieces so they can hear Rafael describe what is happening right in front of them. In his booth, Rafael's eyes go wide and he bellows, \"Gooooooooooal!\"\n\nHe takes a breath. \"My heart overflows! My heart overflows!\" he shouts. \"Chapecoense! The team of our heart is reborn with a goal from its past!\"",

A towel with a similar sentiment was also stolen off a fan during the match, in which Taiwan's Lee Yang and Wang Chi-Lin beat China's Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang to win gold.\n\nThe Badminton World Federation did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the situation.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams cited the 1981 agreement for Taiwan to participate as Chinese Taipei when asked about the incident.\n\n\"There are very clear rules,\" Adams said at the daily IOC news conference in Paris. \"Banners are not allowed. You can see how this can lead into: 'If that's allowed then why not this?'\" That is why the rules are quite strict. We have to try to bring 206 national Olympic committees together in one place. It is quite a tough ask.\"\n\nChina claims Taiwan as its own territory to be annexed by force if necessary and rejects all manifestations of the island's independent identity. Chinese students and undercover officers living abroad are frequently deployed to disrupt support for Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet and the traditionally Muslim northwestern region of Xinjiang, according to Taiwan's de-facto ambassador to France, Wu Chih-chung.\n\nChina constantly subjects Taiwan to political isolation and military threats, and the island is only allowed to participate in the Olympics and other international competitions under the name Chinese Taipei. It cannot fly its own flag or play its national anthem.\n\nDespite that, Taiwanese fans at the match sang the anthem during the medal ceremony, drawing a huge wave of support online and in local media.",

I remember running as hard as I could, and my dad knew I needed his approval, and I think my father wouldn't give it to me because he kept pushing me and kept pushing me and kept pushing me. Every time my dad pushed me, I got better and stronger.\" ---Beyonc\u00e9, \"Life is but a Dream,\" 2013\n\nIn the era of my teenage girlhood, Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles was very familiar to me. Driven by an athletic prowess cultivated in us by our fathers, we were on the same team -- Southern, black girls, who would never be as thin as Maria Sharapova but who were determined to be strong-spirited, to be the best at whatever we did.\n\nLike Beyonc\u00e9, when the humidity thickened into the heaviest heat of the summer, I knew it was time to run. I would sprint, with my team, up and down the bleachers of a school gym equipped with large industrial fans that rarely caused the damp air to budge. I would run around a buckled track that had dandelions and wild grasses growing at its edges. Eventually, I'd return to those laps in my adult life as the stakes rose with my own success.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 started out in a harsher climate in Houston, a city with heat thicker than that of my hometown, Louisville, Kentucky. Her coach was her father. The members of Destiny's Child were her team. She learned to cycle through the athlete's seasons, and this fundamental training would sharpen her into the greatest performer of my \"millennial\" lifetime.\n\nWhat she did on stage said every loud thing to me. She was never too glamorous to break a sweat. She was curvy but fit, and when she talked, her voice came out in a low drawl that swallowed the ends of her words and released them in declarations of power.\n\nPerhaps this tenacity is why first lady Michelle Obama, herself an advocate for physical fitness, thought it was best to choose Queen B for the White House's nationwide initiative against childhood obesity, and why FLOTUS has even joked, on multiple occasions, about wanting to be Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nArtistic craft and athleticism aren't that different. Beyonc\u00e9 approaches her work with principles similar to those champions live by: You see her same attitude in the proactive hustle of Serena Williams' enterprising plays, the precision of Gabby Douglas' routines. The best moments in sports are the result of the same gorgeously crafted technique that makes for inspiring art. Think Michael Jordan's iconic flight from the free throw line and the drama of Steph Curry's 400th 3-pointer.\n\nYonc\u00e9 has always been the shooter that stays alone in the gym when there is no one left to rebound. As a result of this work ethic, she will frequently perform a physical feat that spurs our collective heart into adrenaline-fueled rapture. For example, she transformed a near-fall into a graceful jump squat, live and in heels, before syncing right back into her signature high-energy choreography during her Super Bowl 50 halftime show appearance. Another time, she danced and sang a span of four octaves while five months pregnant, again live and in heels, at the 2011 MTV Video Music awards.\n\nMy father belongs to the generation that stubbornly refuses to offer its approval for anything us younger folks do. Nothing is done the way it used to be. We just aren't made the same. Usain Bolt isn't worth the salt in Carl Lewis' sweat. Bruno Mars couldn't shine Prince's shoes. But in her Super Bowl show, which exceeded the length of an NBA quarter at 13 minutes, Beyonc\u00e9's coordination and stamina were incomparable, and even my father had to admit that she was \"the greatest performer since Michael Jackson.\"\n\nAs I've watched her accumulate victories and secure independence, Beyonc\u00e9 has been a model for me. Her system has been a scale by which to measure my own work ethic. In sweet, recent time, I have witnessed her bring images of our black-girl, thick-fit, voluptuous-muscular bodies to the foreground. It took a couple of decades. It took agility, energy, drive, strategy, running the plays over and over again, in heels, but here we are on enormous screens, on the most-watched television events in America. Here are Serena Williams and Beyonc\u00e9 on the courts of their sports, blurring the lines between athlete and artist. Here we are. Look at what we do in these bodies. Look at where we come from.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 the athlete goes home to her childhood house, to that park in her mind, to remember the vision, to triumph over whatever heat-heavy fear, whatever thing is trying to silence her, to see the distance she has come. I go back to a blacktop that shares space with the wild, to a big country city in the middle of nowhere, thick with honeysuckle and bees.\n\nJoy Priest is a writer living in Newark, New Jersey.

    "raw_text": "India's top badminton stars PV Sindhu and Lakshya Sen will return to BWF Tour action after almost a month at the Japan Masters Super 500 starting Tuesday.\n\nWhile the Super 500 is not the biggest tournament in the badminton calendar, it's important in the context of the Indians' recent form. Both Sindhu and Lakshya are looking to rebuild some momentum in the second half of the season, after a disappointing Olympics (for differing reasons) in August, a recovery break and an indifferent comeback in October at the European swing.\n\nThe upcoming weeks - the Japan Masters followed by a Super 750 in China and the Syed Modi Super 300 at home - offers both singles players a chance to end their challenging season on a positive note. Indeed, both Sindhu and Lakshya reached Japan early to prepare better for the tournament (and were absent from Kidambi Srikanth's weeding over the weekend).\n\nIn Sindhu's case, she's also working with a whole new coaching team (Anup Sridhar and Lee Syun Il) post the Olympics and looking for a complete reset as she contends with not being the consistent top 10 player she was before. \"I'm in good shape, physically and mentally fit. We've been working on different aspects, like speed and defence. I hope to perform well in Japan and China with their guidance,\" she said. Their current contract is only till the end of this year and these tournaments will be a test for both the player and coaches ahead of the next season.\n\nThe 29-year-old is not seeded at tournaments anymore and will start her campaign against eighth-seeded Thai Busanan Ongbamrungphan. But this may be a clash where ranking is irrelevant as Sindhu leads the Thai 18-1 in their head-to-head. And while her shock first-round exit to Canada's Michelle Li in Finland may have been a dent in her H2H equations, Sindhu will be confident of this opener.\n\nIncidentally, a win could set up a rematch with Li (who plays Natsuki Nidaira), which gives Sindhu incentive. If she manages to get past both her old rivals, the quarterfinal opponent will likely be Chinese top seed Wang Zhi Yi (H2H 2-2).\n\nThe good news for Sindhu is that this is a comparatively good draw for her. If she can shake off the rust she showed initially in Europe and settle in like at the Denmark Open, she can get some good reps in on court and build good momentum.\n\nAt the other end is Lakshya Sen, who had a win-less run in the two European tournaments after the Olympics where he reached the bronze medal match beating higher ranked players.\n\nThere is no doubt that Lakshya has the game and physicality to challenge the best, but his mental blocks seem to have become an even bigger issue after the fourth-place finish in Paris. Indeed, he lost to Chou Tien Chen from a game up in Finland, after playing one of his career's best matches to beat him at the Olympics.\n\nThe only way out is to get into challenging matches and coming out with a win, and Japan and China may give him just the chance.\n\nHe starts against Malaysia's Leong Jun Hao, whom he leads 3-1 and should be confident of beating. The second round will be a potential match against eighth seed Anthony Ginting, who Lakshya has never lost to in 3 meetings. Their contrasting game styles means the Indian has an opportunity to get a confidence boosting win if his defence clicks. However, he is in a tricky quarter with the unseeded challengers like Lu Guang Zu and Toma Junior Popov along with second seed Kodai Naraoka, so he will need his A game to make a deep run.\n\nThe only Indian representation in doubles will be Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand, who are also looking for a deep run of their own that can bring back consistency to a now-erratic combination. They face Chinese Taipei's Hsu Yin-Hui and Lin Jhih Yun in their opening match, against whom they have a 2-0 record. But the second round will be against Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning, which could be a big challenge.\n\nThe Japan Masters begins with qualification on Tuesday and the Indian players will start their campaign on Wednesday.",

There's recovery, videos, game, recovery, videos, game, for 40 days ... We'll need to rotate to have the players ready. We'll need the entire squad at this stage of the season.\"\n\nAfter the Espanyol game, Madrid face Legan\u00e9s in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals, before a derby with Atletico Madrid in LaLiga.\n\nThey will then play the first leg of their Champions League playoff, before visiting Osasuna in the league, the Champions League second leg, and then another LaLiga game at Girona, followed by a possible Copa del Rey semifinal.\n\n\"Nothing changes,\" Ancelotti said, when asked how the two extra playoff games had affected his planning. \"In a perfect world, we wouldn't play them, but we weren't able to get into the top eight, and that's OK. Playing two more or fewer games doesn't matter ... we have the resources to deal with it.\"\n\nMadrid forward Rodrygo was the latest player to attract interest from the Saudi Pro League this week, with Al Hilal making contact with the Brazil international's representatives.\n\nRodrygo has been a key player for Madrid in recent weeks, scoring seven goals in January including two Champions League braces against Salzburg and Brest.\n\n\"It's hard to talk about the future of players, because they're personal decisions,\" Ancelotti said, when asked about Rodrygo. \"What I see is that the players here are happy to be here and want to stay here, they want to win trophies. After that, what each thinks, I don't know ... There are a lot of players who want to be in Rodrygo's or Vin\u00edcius' place, and wear this shirt.\"\n\nAncelotti wouldn't confirm that Madrid will not add to their squad before the Spanish transfer window closes on Monday, and welcomed the return to the team of Vin\u00edcius after his two-game ban in LaLiga.\n\n\"He's aware of what he has to do on the pitch,\" Ancelotti said, when asked if Vin\u00edcius should try harder to avoid being booked. \"He's a mature person, and we're delighted he can come back. He's trained well, he's fresh and can bring a lot to the team tomorrow.\"",

His reasons are complicated, and he's reluctant to express them.\n\n\"I'm afraid, I'm afraid,\" he says in stilted English. \"In Syria now, if you talk, somebody will kill you -- for what you talk, for what you think. Not for what you do. They will kill you for what you think.\"\n\nKhatib is bearded and runty, with curly brown hair and kind eyes. He has earned millions playing professionally in Kuwait. The mall's posh setting offers a glimpse into his comfortable life here -- yachts bobbing on scalloped blue water, robed men and women drawing flavored tobacco from tableside water pipes. But Khatib seems nearly crushed by the weight of his dilemma, which he discusses over two days of interviews. \"Every day before I sleep, maybe one hour, two hours, just thinking about this decision.\"\n\nStart Your Sunday With A Story\n\nE:60 showcases the best in longform television journalism, including a full-length feature on the Syrian soccer team this week, at 9 a.m. ET Sunday on ESPN. Listen to reporter Steve Fainaru and producer Greg Amante's podcast about this story.\n\nKhatib pulls out his phone to show his Facebook page, which receives a hundred messages a day. Even some of his closest friends are ready to turn on him. One player he grew up with, Nihad Saadeddine, says if Khatib returns to Syria he'll be relegated to \"the garbage bin of history along with everyone who supports the criminal Bashar al-Assad.\" Saadeddine vows never to speak to Khatib again.\n\nSometime within the next 36 days, when Syria plays its next match, Khatib must choose between two great evils that plague the modern world.\n\nIf he rejoins Syria, he will be team captain and the most important player in his country's quest to make the World Cup for the first time. He will also represent a government that -- along with nerve gas, torture, rape, starvation and the bombing of civilians -- has used soccer as a weapon to promote its murderous rule.\n\nIf he continues his boycott, he'll be aligned with a complicated movement that began with peaceful demonstrations and has since splintered to include al-Qaida and ISIS. ISIS has used soccer as a backdrop for some of its most heinous crimes, including the 2015 bombings at the Stade de France and a 2016 bombing at a youth soccer match in Iraq that killed 29 children.\n\n\"Now, in Syria, many killers, not just one or two,\" Khatib says. \"And I hate all of them.\"\n\nHe's at a loss.\n\n\"Whatever happen, 12 million Syrians will love me,\" he says. \"Other 12 million will want to kill me.\"\n\nEmbedded inside Syria's civil war is a civil war in miniature: a wrenching and sometimes bloody fight for the soul of the national sport.\n\nSyria's improbable World Cup bid has pitted player against player, coach against coach -- divisions that mirror the conflict that is remaking much of the world. During six years of civil war, at least 470,000 Syrians have died, and life expectancy in the country has dropped from 70 years to 55. Representing a nation with more than 12 million displaced people -- roughly half the population -- the national soccer team is yet another battleground between the followers and opponents of Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe Syrian government contends that soccer is the one place where Syrians of all sides can come together in peace. Soccer is \"a dream that brings people together. It gives people a smile and helps them forget the smell of destruction and death,\" says Bashar Mohammad, the Syrian national team's spokesman.\n\nIn reality, the Assad regime -- backed by FIFA's tacit support -- has woven soccer into its grisly campaign of state-sponsored oppression, a seven-month investigation by Outside the Lines and ESPN The Magazine shows.\n\nThe Syrian government has shot, bombed or tortured to death at least 38 players from the top two divisions of the Syrian professional leagues and dozens more from lower divisions, according to information compiled by Anas Ammo, a former sports writer from Aleppo who tracks human rights abuses involving Syrian athletes. At least 13 players are missing. Although opposition forces have killed soccer players on a smaller scale -- Ammo attributes four such deaths to ISIS -- the Syrian Network for Human Rights concluded that the Assad government has \"used athletes and sporting activities to support ... its brutal oppressive practices.\" Soccer stadiums have been used as military bases to launch attacks on civilians. From the beginning of the war, according to players, teams were essentially forced to march in support of Assad, sometimes carrying banners and wearing T-shirts with the president's image. \"Assad was keen to show people that athletes and artists were strongly supporting him because those are the people with the most influence in the street,\" Ammo says. \"The marches were obligatory.\"\n\nThe ESPN investigation drew upon interviews with current and former players, current and former Syrian soccer officials, and friends and relatives of victims, as well as reviews of case studies and publicly available videos confirmed by human rights monitors. The interviews took place between September 2016 and March 2017 in Malaysia, Germany, Turkey, Sweden, Kuwait and South Korea.\n\nAllegations that Syria is in violation of FIFA's rules prohibiting political interference in matters related to soccer were delivered to FIFA's doorstep in 2015. FIFA has cited those rules 20 times over the past decade to suspend countries from international play. But in the case of the Syria allegations, which were contained in a 20-page document titled \"War Crimes against Syrian Football Players,\" FIFA responded that the \"tragic circumstances ... go far beyond the domain of sporting matters\" and concluded that the issue was beyond its control. FIFA officials declined to be interviewed by ESPN but issued a statement saying the organization is limited in its jurisdiction and its \"capacity to verify any allegations in such a complex setting.\"\n\n\"There is a contradiction between FIFA's decisions and its rules,\" says Ayman Kasheet, a former Syrian player who hand-delivered the allegations to FIFA's headquarters in Zurich. \"They issue a directive to freeze a federation because of political interference, while at the same time there is all-out war occurring in a country where stadiums are being used to store military equipment, where children and soccer players under 18 years of age are dying, where soccer players are being thrown in prison. All this is taking place and there is abundant proof, but where is the decision? This is hypocrisy.\"\n\nMark Afeeva, a London attorney who specializes in sports law and has studied FIFA's independence statutes, agrees that Syria represents \"a clear case of systemic state interference in domestic and international football, and yet FIFA has chosen not to act. Simply put, it doesn't have the balls to get involved in what is clearly a very nefarious affair.\"\n\nFadi Dabbas, the vice president of the Syrian Football Association and the head of delegation for the national team, dismisses the accounts as \"not true at all\" and says they were made up by exiled players who oppose Assad. \"The regime protects the Syrian people, and their problem is they are outside of Syria and represent only themselves,\" Dabbas says.\n\nSyria's presence on the World Cup scene has created a moral conflict not only for FIFA but also for players and fans. Hundreds of Syrian players have fled to neighboring countries and Europe. They include players who, like Firas al-Khatib, have refused to represent the regime. One, defender Firas al-Ali, made a dramatic predawn escape from the national team during training camp and fled the country, shortly after learning that his 13-year-old cousin had been killed in a government attack.\n\nAli now lives in a tent with his wife and three children at the Karkamis Refugee Camp in southern Turkey. In an interview with ESPN, he called playing for the national team \"a dishonor. It was something I just could not do. I felt like I was betraying all the sons of our nation who had been killed by the tyranny and oppression. Those players, they are carrying the flag of death.\"\n\nSeremban, Malaysia\n\nOn a steamy September afternoon, with rain threatening, the players from Syria's national team, clad in white jerseys, are sprawled in the lobby of the Royale Bintang Resort & Spa, waiting for the bus to take them to practice. This is their home for Round 3 of World Cup qualifying, which began in September 2016 and runs through this September.\n\nTeam Syria is like an abandoned child, bouncing from one foster home to another. Syria normally plays its home games in Damascus and Aleppo, but FIFA won't allow it because it cannot guarantee the safety of players and fans. After spending Round 2 of the Asian qualifiers in Oman, Syria was unable to find a Round 3 host in the entire Middle East. Days before the first match, Macau offered to host, then backed out. On the verge of forfeiting, the team settled for Seremban, an industrial city separated from Syria by 4,700 miles and the Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysia's Independence Day has just passed, and the lobby is covered with patriotic slogans and dozens of red, white and blue flags, which hover ironically over the Syrians. I AM A CHILD OF MALAYSIA, one slogan reads. The players are exhausted, bewildered over how they ended up here. The qualifying round started three days earlier in Uzbekistan with a 1-0 loss. After waiting to find out its new home, the team traveled 20 hours -- from Tashkent to Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur -- before busing 40 miles to Seremban. \"We heard that our home was going to be Qatar, then Lebanon or Macau,\" says the team captain, Abdulrazak al-Hussein. \"I don't know what happened exactly. There shouldn't be all these rejections and non-acceptances.\"\n\nSyria's national soccer team\n\nSyria is scheduled to play South Korea two nights later. A decade ago, a qualifier against the same team drew 35,000 people in Syria. As they wait, the players debate how many fans might show up this time: \"Hopefully three!\" one says, laughing.\n\nGiven the challenges, Syria's success thus far has been shocking. In addition to the logistics challenges and the defections of key players, the team is largely broke. FIFA was forced to freeze development money for Syria because of sanctions imposed on the country by the United States and the European Union. In Seremban, the team is practicing at a scruffy local pitch to avoid paying a $3,500 stadium fee, says Kouteiba al-Refai, the team's harried general secretary. Refai himself is unpaid.\n\nSyria advanced out of Round 2 by finishing second behind Japan. It's the closest Syria has come to making the World Cup in 31 years. FIFA has celebrated the scrappy team as the ultimate overachiever, posting stories on FIFA.com about the team's heroic struggle to make the World Cup against all odds. \"What Syria have achieved ... seems nothing short of a miracle,\" read one article last February.\n\nThe stories leave out one detail: Team Syria represents a government accused of committing war crimes against its own people.\n\nFIFA has essentially adopted the position of the Assad regime, which maintains that Syria's national team is politically neutral. Dabbas, the Syrian businessman who serves as head of the delegation, says the team's primary goal, beyond qualifying for the World Cup, is \"to bring all Syrians together\" and \"prove to the world that Syria is fine, that Syria has a pulse.\" The team represents \"all of Syria.\"\n\nBut Dabbas makes it clear that Syria is playing for \"our president\" and is loyal to Assad. \"Any Syrian inside Syria represents President Bashar Assad, and His Excellency President Dr. Bashar Assad represents us. We are proud of our president. We are proud of what he's achieved. And we want to send him our regards and thanks for what he has done for Syria, and we are behind him and under his leadership.\"\n\nAssad, according to Dabbas, watches every game and is \"following the most minute details of the team.\"\n\nThere are numerous signs, in fact, that the Syrian national team represents not a unified vision of Syria but the benign face of a ruthless dictatorship. In November 2015 in Singapore, the head coach, a player and the team spokesman showed up to a prematch news conference wearing T-shirts bearing Assad's photo. In comments widely circulated among Syrian refugees, the coach, Fajer Ebrahim, used the World Cup platform to proclaim Assad the \"best man in the world.\"\n\nEbrahim, who is not coaching the team in the third round of World Cup qualifying, began an interview with ESPN in Kuala Lumpur by launching into an impromptu speech in praise of Assad. \"We know our president is the right man, and a very, very great man,\" he said. \"Without our president, Syria is destroyed.\"\n\nAsked about the appropriateness of using World Cup competition to make political statements, Ebrahim replied: \"Everything is linked now. Everything's related.\"\n\nGiven the pressures inside Syria, where thousands of people have been tortured and killed for opposing Assad, it's difficult to assess the candor of those affiliated with the team and what their allegiances are. Anas Ammo, the well-connected former sports writer who has documented human rights crimes against Syrian athletes, works as a sports agent in Mersin, Turkey. He says some players on the national team have family members who were detained or killed by the regime. \"They are basically forced to play, otherwise they may kill their relatives,\" says Ammo, requesting that the players' names remain private to protect them and their families. Ammo says he knows of two national team members who play out of fear that the government, which controls their travel documents, will withhold their passports, making it impossible for them to play abroad. Other players, Ammo says, are loyal to Assad.\n\nAmmo believes that if players were granted control over their passports, a large number would defect.\n\nWeary and jet-lagged, the Syrians take the field at Seremban's Tuanku Abdul Rahman Stadium on a muggy September night. Admission is free, but there are fewer than 5,000 people in the 45,000-seat stadium. A hundred or so Syrians, mostly students down from Kuala Lumpur, cheer at midfield on the far sideline. South Korea, a perennial Asian power, threatens often but can't score, and soon Syria is battling to hang on for a scoreless tie that would give the team its first point. Every minute or so, a Syrian player flops to the grass, trying to run out the clock.\n\nWith time running down, the Syrian fans unfurl a huge banner. It's a picture of Assad, stretching 20 rows. The crowd jumps up and down, stomps its feet and chants: \"Syria! Syria!\" Within seconds, Malaysian security guards rush to the section and force the Syrians to put the banner away.\n\nWhen the whistle blows on the 0-0 tie, a Syrian coach turns a cartwheel and the players storm the field.\n\n\"Today's result, it's not an achievement but rather a miracle,\" says team captain Hussein during the sweaty aftermath. \"Today the Syrian team proved that it is a team of heroes, not just players.\"\n\nBerlin\n\nOn the other side of the world is an alternate reality.\n\nOne freezing, rainy afternoon in February, two dozen Syrian refugees cram into the visitors locker room of SV Buchholz, an amateur sports club that plays on a lower rung of German soccer called the Bezirksliga. The one-story building, narrow and gray, is tucked into a residential side street in northeast Berlin. Behind it is the soccer field. One by one, the Syrians fish their green jerseys out of a rumpled paper bag. Syria's revolutionary flag -- three red stars superimposed over green, white and black horizontal bands -- is taped over the window.\n\nAt least two of these \"Free Syria\" teams have competed in exhibition matches in Turkey and Germany. The teams, which include veterans of the Syrian Premier League, are part of a Syrian refugee population that has swelled to nearly 6 million -- roughly the population of Massachusetts. The team in Germany represents \"the people who have been oppressed by the regime,\" including \"martyred athletes who gave their lives for the country,\" says the coach, Nihad Saadeddine. \"This team, God willing, will be the official representative of Free Syria.\"\n\nThe players from SV Buchholz arrive one by one, nonchalant and carefree. Electronic music pulsates from their locker room, making it feel as if the entire building has a heartbeat. They are mostly blond and fit, as if they emerged from a German travel brochure. The Syrians, even in their new uniforms, seem disheveled and broken, a collection of game individuals who have come together for a cause. \"The players who are here, there are a large number who were injured or detained,\" Saadeddine says. The coach is 35 but looks 10 years older, with thinning dark hair and haunted eyes. A longtime midfielder in Syria, he can no longer play. During the government's siege of Homs, Saadeddine says he was shot in the knee by a sniper, then essentially crushed when a mortar struck behind a wall as he was evacuating women and children from an apartment building. When he arrived in Austria, where he lives now, doctors discovered five cracked vertebrae.\n\nSaadeddine gives his locker room pep talk: \"Guys, we have a cause, and I hope everyone will be up to the task -- to demonstrate to people the criminality of this regime, what they have done to athletes and the detainees; It's our obligation to talk about them. ... We need to have our voices heard, that we stand together to expose this regime to the world, that there is a revolution and that there are free athletes. When you say you are on the team of Free Syria, you are representing millions.\"\n\nSyria's Civil War\n\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad's scorched-earth authoritarian response to protests in 2011 triggered a civil war that has displaced millions of people and killed more than 470,000. It continues today.\n\nOne of the Free Syria players, Jaber al-Kurdi, was detained by the regime in 2013 in the city of Hama, where he played for a team called Taliya. Kurdi says he supported the opposition but never fired a gun. \"Do you think these hands could carry a weapon?\" he says, turning up pink palms. \"A girl's hand is bigger than mine.\" Kurdi says he attended protests and provided clothing and shelter for the displaced: \"I don't like blood or bloodshed, but when I saw people arriving in Hama and sleeping outside in the parks and streets, I couldn't just stand and watch.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch has described Assad's vast prison network as \"a torture archipelago.\" Kurdi says he was held for nine months without trial, shuttled between detention centers in Hama, Homs and Damascus. At the \"Palestine\" branch of the Military Intelligence Directorate in Damascus, guards repeatedly beat the soles of his feet with a rubber hose and shocked him through electric wires attached to his skull. For a week, he says, he was confined in a narrow ceramic pen, unable to sit and barely able to move. \"It's cold, and they would come in and throw water on me and leave,\" Kurdi says. He says he was let out for five minutes a day to relieve himself and that he occasionally received pieces of stale bread pushed through the door.\n\nThe 25-year-old has soft features, a three-day beard and dark shadows beneath his eyes. At the end of his incarceration, he says, he was brought before a military judge, who ordered him released. As the guard handed him his belongings -- an empty wallet -- he grabbed Kurdi's hand and sliced his index finger with a knife.\n\n\"That's so you'll remember us,\" the guard told him, says Kurdi, holding up a thin scar.\n\nSince arriving in Germany, Kurdi says he's been treated for recurring nightmares in which he sees Syrian security agents chasing him through the bombed-out streets of Hama.\n\n\"My heart aches, I swear to God,\" he says, breaking down during an interview. \"I'm not happy here. The German government took us in and gave us safety and security. We appreciate that, but psychologically, we're not happy. Our people are being slaughtered.\"\n\nAnother Free Syria player, Basel Hawa, says he was caught plotting his defection from the Syrian army after concluding: \"We're killing our own people.\" He says he was held for two months in a small cell with 12 detainees who had to defecate in a hole in the floor. Hawa says he was released after Assad granted a limited amnesty in 2014. He eventually fled to Germany.\n\nOne player comes up in nearly every conversation with the Free Syria team, but he is not here in Berlin. Jihad Qassab was a retired midfielder in his early 40s who starred for Karama, the professional team in Homs. Why Qassab was arrested, on Aug. 19, 2014, is not clear. There's never been a trial.\n\nQassab's family and friends believe he was taken to Sednaya Military Prison, the heart of darkness of Assad's torture archipelago. One former detainee told Amnesty International that guards segregate weaker prisoners and force larger ones to rape them. There were constant beatings with pipes, shredded tank treads and hooked cables designed to tear away flesh. Sednaya contains an underground execution chamber consisting of two platforms and dozens of nooses, according to Amnesty International, which called Sednaya \"a human slaughterhouse.\" Amnesty estimates that up to 13,000 Syrians were subjected to a policy of \"extermination\" over a four-year period at the prison.\n\nLast September, more than two years after Qassab disappeared, it was announced that he was dead. The mosques in Homs were the first to report the news, then social media, the Syrian Network for Human Rights and news wires around the world. There were no other details.\n\n\"If Jihad lived in another country, he would have been honored and rewarded for his long history of achievements in sports,\" says Mohamed Hameed, a former Karama player and a close friend of Qassab's. \"In Syria, under Assad, he gets detained and tortured.\"\n\nQassab's body was never recovered, according to his friends, and some are convinced he might be alive. Rashad Shamma, an old friend, held a small ceremony for Qassab in front of his candy shop in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt's a measure of Syria's twisted reality that a star like Qassab can disappear, be pronounced dead and have a service held for him yet Shamma can still say matter-of-factly: \"He might be dead or alive. Who knows?\"\n\nFadi Dabbas, the vice president of the Syrian Football Association, first told ESPN that he knew nothing about Qassab's fate and had never heard of him: \"I do not know of this name at all,\" Dabbas said. When it was pointed out that Qassab played in the Syrian Premier League for over a decade, he said: \"I don't know where he went after he left Karama. I don't know what happened. I have no information about this subject.\"\n\nDespite the symbolism, Free Syria's match against SV Buchholz ends in a 5-2 defeat for the Syrians, under a cold and steady rain, in front of a few dozen Germans who straggle in on a Sunday afternoon to watch their friends and relatives play a curious exhibition.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the match is both heroic and uncomfortable to watch. The Syrians score first on a beautiful cross. But by the second half, the Germans -- better conditioned and blessed with normal lives that allow them to practice regularly (the Syrians came together for the first time the day before) -- blast away at the goal. One hard shot hits a Syrian defender square in the face, leaving him motionless on the ground for several minutes before he walks off gingerly.\n\nThe Free Syrians present themselves as an alternative to the national team sponsored by Assad. But more than anything, the exhibition against SV Buchholz shows that it isn't that -- not even close. There is only one Team Syria, and the players who are good enough to make it must decide for themselves what it represents.\n\nKarkamis Refugee Camp, Turkey\n\nIn July 2012, when Firas al-Khatib announced he would no longer play for Syria, his hometown, Homs, was in flames. The west-central city, once Syria's third largest, is known as the \"capital of the revolution.\" The previous year, when peaceful protests against Assad's authoritarian government spread across the country, thousands of Homs residents took to the streets. As he did in other cities, Assad responded with overwhelming force. The government's response to the nationwide protests triggered a civil war that now features a bizarre cauldron of global superpowers, foreign terrorists, warlords, militias and freedom fighters.\n\nAssad's scorched-earth campaign in Homs included rape and starvation -- some residents ate grass to survive, according to witnesses and opposition activists. Massacres were reported in which witnesses saw Assad forces round up and kill civilians.\n\nKhatib is one of Homs' most prominent citizens and one of Syria's most famous athletes -- a national star since his teens. He left the country in the early 2000s to play professionally in Belgium, China and, for more than a decade, Kuwait, where he broke the league's career scoring record. Khatib used his soccer earnings to help build a street in Homs -- Al Khatib Street -- complete with a soccer field and a mosque that also bears the family name. Despite the millions he earned playing abroad, he always came home to represent Syria. \"To play for national team, it's 24 million watch you, 24 million support you to win,\" he says.\n\nKhatib's boycott, announced at a rally in Kuwait City, was a blow to Assad. Draped in a sash with the revolution colors, Khatib told the screaming crowd: \"Here in front of the media, I want to say that I will never play for the Syrian national team as long as there are bombs falling anywhere in Syria.\"\n\nOne man lifted Khatib onto his shoulders. The crowd addressed him as Abu Hamza, an affectionate nickname meaning \"Father of Hamza,\" his oldest son.\n\n\"God bless you, Abu Hamza! God bless you!\"\n\nKhatib plays for Kuwait Sporting Club, his fourth team in Kuwait. Standing on the sideline of his home stadium one afternoon in February, he struggles to explain how he could think about representing Syria again, given his previous stance and the atrocities the government continues to inflict on the civilian population.\n\n\"What happened is very complicated,\" he says. \"I can't talk more about these things. Sorry, sorry, I'm very sorry. Better for me, better for my country, better for my family, better for everybody if I not talk about that.\"\n\nBut he offers clues.\n\nKhatib says he has not set foot on Al Khatib Street in six years. He has not seen his father, who can't leave the country because of illness. \"It's the hardest time in my life,\" he says. \"I don't want to come back because I play for a national team or because I support a government or not support the government. I want to come back to Syria like one person from Syria. I want to see my parents finally, and my brothers.\" Khatib says he still dreams of returning to Homs as president of Karama, the local team.\n\nAt the time Khatib announced his boycott, many believed Assad would fall. \"In that time is really good revolution -- want the country grow up, the country more strong, the people want to live better,\" he says. Now Assad is entrenched. The government controls not only Homs but also, as of December, Aleppo, once the most populous city. The Syrian professional league, which had been confined to two cities -- Damascus and Latakia -- is competing again in other parts of the country. In late January, Ittihad and Hurriyah, Aleppo's main rivals, played their first game in the city since 2012, an event heralded by the government as a sign that Syria is returning to normal.\n\n\"I [said] I will not play until this killing, this dying, stop,\" Khatib says. \"Now, you ask me about why you change. I change for just a football decision, not a politics decision. We want to be happy. We want something to make us happy. Everything now in Syria makes us sad.\"\n\nHe has five weeks to decide whether to join Syria for its next match. Since tying South Korea in Malaysia, the team has beaten China and tied Iran, the group leader. Syria's first appearance in the World Cup is within reach.\n\nKhatib is asked how he can consider representing a government that continues to bomb civilians, that tortures and murders \"people you love, teammates of yours.\"\n\n\"Very, very, very difficult question,\" Khatib says, smiling plaintively. \"I can't talk, really. I want to talk. But I can't.\"\n\nThe beautiful game against ugly reality\n\nFor other players, representing Assad is an unthinkable betrayal.\n\nOne is Firas al-Ali.\n\n\"I saw Syria as paradise on earth,\" says Ali, a former defender on the national team.\n\nBut he's no longer in Syria, and this isn't paradise.\n\nThe Karkamis Refugee Camp resembles a low-slung prison. Perched on Turkey's southern border with Syria, the camp is surrounded by gray walls and barbed wire and is controlled by the Turkish government. The 6,886 occupants (including 1,963 children) are free to leave, if only they had somewhere to go and the means to get there.\n\nAli once owned three houses. Now all his belongings are stuffed into a large white tent, one of hundreds erected symmetrically on the sun-baked earth. Ali's tent is no bigger or smaller than his neighbors', but inside it's immaculate and formal. White lace curtains line the canvas walls, and an Oriental rug covers the wood foundation. Floral-patterned cushions form a U-shaped sitting area. A small silver teapot rests atop a hot plate, and there's even a 13-inch TV and a mini fridge. Ali, 31, his wife and three children have lived at Karkamis for three years. His young daughter, Aysha, was born here.\n\nAli has dark hair that sweeps across his forehead and the willowy grace of a pro athlete. For close observers of Syrian soccer, his predicament is difficult to comprehend, a star athlete left to live among his fans in tent housing. Ali played for Shorta, one of the top teams in Damascus, earning $125,000 a season, a fortune in Syria. More important, he represented Syria. \"From 23 million people, I was one of the 20 best players in my country,\" he says. \"I was famous and recognized wherever I went. My material situation was excellent. I had a good family and a good reputation. I never thought of even taking a step outside my country.\"\n\nNow he's a refugee, his family's needs met by the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority.\n\nAli says he would rather live in a refugee camp than play for Syria. In 2011, when Assad's forces attacked Hama, his hometown, Ali's 19-year-old cousin Abdullah, a college geography student, was shot and killed during a protest. \"The bullet struck his eye and came out of his head,\" Ali says. Later, a barrel bomb -- a gas-filled oil drum the regime has heaved from helicopters by the thousands -- fell through the roof of a house and incinerated his niece as she stood in her kitchen. Ali says he arrived a few minutes later. \"To see a human being cut to pieces, it's a nightmare,\" he says. \"She was almost 200 pounds; she was heavily built. We couldn't find her.\" Ali joined the protests, covering his face because he was so recognizable. He felt he was leading a double life: challenging Assad in the streets and representing him on the field.\n\nOne morning Ali showed up for practice at Abbasiyyin Stadium in Damascus and found that it had been converted into a military base. \"We had half of the stadium, and the 4th Division [of the Syrian Army] had the other half. This I saw with my own eyes! There was artillery in places meant for athletes. They would go out to suppress the demonstrations from the stadium that I was practicing in. I'd hear gunfire from inside the stadium. And the demonstrators still didn't have weapons. The only ones who carried weapons at that time were the regime.\"\n\nThe national team's head coach was Fajer Ebrahim, the Assad loyalist who later wore a T-shirt with the president's picture before a World Cup qualifying match. Ebrahim spoke openly about the need to crush the protests, Ali says. By winning games, Ebrahim told the players, Syria would show the world that the uprising was having little effect. The players were divided: \"We were destroying ourselves,\" Ali says. He felt increasingly demoralized, his effort on the field diminished \"because I was so distracted. Friends were dying, relatives were dying.\"\n\nAli sometimes stayed at the Blue Tower Hotel, a four-star hotel on Hamra Street in Damascus. One sleepless night, he says, he watched in horror from his eighth-floor window as the government shelled civilian neighborhoods around the city. \"It was as though I was watching an action movie on television,\" he says. \"It was terrifying.\"\n\nAnother night, while the national team was training for a tournament in India, Ali got a call that his 13-year-old cousin, Alaa, had been killed during a government attack in a village outside Hama. Thirty minutes later, he joined the national team for dinner. When one of his teammates mocked the protesters, Ali says he hurled a spoon at him before teammates pulled them apart. Ali returned to his room and called his family.\n\n\"I'm done,\" he told his sister.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she responded.\n\n\"I don't want to play for them, ever,\" he replied.\n\nHe arranged for two of his brothers to pick him up at 5:30 the following morning. From there, Ali sped off to rebel-held territories, waved through at checkpoints, he says, by soldiers who recognized him as a famous athlete but were unaware he was fleeing the regime. He crossed the border into Turkey with his young family. Ali was free, but suddenly he had new challenges. \"I had money in the bank, and after I defected, the regime took it,\" he says. \"I had three houses, and they were destroyed. ... I had a plot of land, it's gone. ... It was just like all my money went.\"\n\nAs he describes his transformation, Ali sits in what passes for a mall at Karkamis: a row of plywood stalls that sells everything from food to canned goods to cookware to generators. One of the vendors brings over platters of grilled meats, and Ali ducks inside one of the stalls -- a cramped hardware store -- to avoid the flies that descend on the food. His days revolve around teaching soccer to children, who flock to him like a camp celebrity. In the late morning, as the sun cuts through the desert haze, Ali and three dozen kids gather on a concrete slab strewn with broken glass to stretch, run laps and scrimmage. Occasionally the ball finds its way to Ali, who manipulates it with the practiced dexterity of his former life.\n\n\"It's hard, but I don't regret anything at all,\" he says. \"How would one feel who is playing under this flag and carrying a picture of the person who is the sole reason for the killing and the death and the expulsion of more than 7 million Syrians?\"\n\nMersin, Turkey\n\nThe central question -- for Khatib, for Ali, for millions of fans -- is what soccer inside Syria represents as the country continues to be torn apart. Can the national team really serve as a peaceful oasis, a place for Syrians to come together? Or is it another weapon for Assad to project normalcy and legitimize his authority?\n\nAnas Ammo has pondered this question at length. His answer was to begin building a sports human rights case against the Syrian government. Ammo saw the project as his way to serve the opposition. He began five years ago, when he realized that athletes were among the most prominent victims of Assad's brutality and that the government was using soccer, Ammo's lifelong passion, as a propaganda tool. With dozens of athletes dead and thousands more living as refugees, Ammo believes that \"a whole generation of football in Syria has disappeared.\"\n\nIn Mersin, Ammo operates out of a sparsely furnished two-room office with a distant view of the Mediterranean. He fled here from Aleppo, where he worked as a sports writer for Syria's Al-Watan newspaper and as a volunteer public relations official with Ittihad, the city's premier soccer club. He was working with Ittihad in 2011, he says, when the government began to compel players to attend pro-Assad demonstrations. Former players told ESPN that such orders were common. \"The players were very angry at them for forcing them to go out,\" Ammo says. \"I really felt sad when I saw sports used like this.\"\n\nAs the civil war escalated, the military began to use stadiums in Damascus, Aleppo, Hama, Homs and other cities as bases and detention facilities, according to former players, human rights monitors and videos taken by activists. Two videos, for example, appear to show rockets being fired from the field at Abbasiyyin Stadium in Damascus, the same facility that Firas al-Ali said players were forced to share with the Syrian Army.\n\nFadi Dabbas, the vice president of the Syrian Football Association and head of delegation for the national team, described the allegations as false, telling ESPN that stadiums were \"never used for military reasons.\" He blamed Western media, which he called biased.\n\nFIFA's statutes, which govern organizations such as the Syrian Football Association, states that \"each member shall manage its affairs independently and with no influence from third parties.\" FIFA has invoked the independence clause at least 24 times over the past decade, resulting in 20 suspensions from international play, in response to activity the organization perceived as government interference. In 2009, for example, FIFA suspended Iraq after learning that the government had disbanded the Iraqi Football Association and sent security agents to take control of its headquarters. In 2014, FIFA suspended Nigeria after the government dissolved the leadership of the Nigerian Football Federation after the World Cup team's disappointing finish in Brazil.\n\nAmmo believed that the violence against players, the exploitation of teams for propaganda purposes and the use of stadiums for military purposes constituted a violation of FIFA statutes. By failing to act against Syria, Ammo believed, FIFA was \"an accomplice to all the crimes that have been committed against the football players and the damage that has been inflicted on the stadiums and sports facilities.\"\n\nAmmo emailed the information to a former player named Ayman Kasheet. A veteran of the Premier League, Kasheet was living in Sweden, where he had been granted residency, and was in close proximity to FIFA's headquarters in Zurich.\n\nKasheet traveled to Zurich to confront FIFA in August 2014. Turned away at the entrance, he decided that to have any influence he needed to assemble a full report. He took a course offered by Amnesty International on how to document human rights violations. The result was a 20-page \"complaint\" that built on Ammo's work, filed on behalf of \"more than 2,000 athletes ... separated from the Syrian Football Federation.\"\n\nKasheet wrote the complaint in English, one of FIFA's four official languages. The document is both ungrammatical and to the point. He cites \"war crimes committed by government forces in Syria against the football players and football stadiums, and the silence of the Syrian Football Federation about these crimes ... .\" The complaint includes a table of 10 players believed to be in government detention and provides photos for nine. Other tables list 11 under-18 players and 20 over-18 players allegedly killed by government forces. Another section shows photos and videos of stadiums occupied by Syrian forces.\n\nMore From Doubletruck\n\nDoubletruck is the home for ESPN storytelling, a place to find great features, investigations and character portraits. Doubletruck home \u00bb\n\nKasheet says he tried to email the information to FIFA but received no response. He returned to Zurich and dropped off the document at the front desk, but again he heard nothing.\n\nIn August 2015, Kasheet returned to FIFA headquarters, this time with an interpreter who helped him film the encounter. After haggling with a receptionist, Kasheet ultimately spoke with Alexander Koch, FIFA's corporate communications manager.\n\n\"He says it would be so much appreciated if FIFA would follow up with the document because the only way to [apply] pressure is through FIFA because FIFA is the umbrella of this federation,\" the interpreter tells Koch in the video.\n\nKoch looks mildly perturbed.\n\n\"The problem that I see is that this is nothing against ... football,\" Koch says.\n\nKoch tells Kasheet that he should file his complaint with the Syrian Football Association, which can then lodge a complaint with FIFA. Kasheet tries to make Koch understand that his complaint is against the Syrian Football Association, which is supported by the Assad government.\n\n\"How can you ask the football federation to submit an official complaint when the case is being made against the Syrian Football Federation?\" Kasheet later tells ESPN. \"It is clear and obvious that the Syrian Football Federation is part of the government. No one would believe otherwise.\"\n\nOne month later, Kasheet received an email from FIFA deputy secretary general Markus Kattner, reiterating that the matter is beyond FIFA's control.\n\n\"FIFA fully supports any effort aiming to ensure that all athletes are able to enjoy practicing the game of football in a violence-free environment and we thank you for your initiative,\" wrote Kattner, who would end up fired for financial misconduct while serving as FIFA's finance director. Kattner added that the circumstances described in the report go \"far beyond\" sports.\n\nKasheet was crushed. \"Shame on FIFA,\" he says during a tearful interview with ESPN in Helsingborg. \"I wasn't asking FIFA to make a decision immediately. I was asking FIFA to investigate. If it's not accurate, they can ignore the information and just say no.\"\n\nESPN sought to interview FIFA officials about Syria and its national team, but FIFA declined the request. A spokesman sent a statement similar to the one sent to Kasheet: \"Over recent years, FIFA has been made aware of allegations by several parties -- often contradicting information according to different sources -- concerning violence that has affected the practice of football in the country. While we fully understand the tragic circumstances surrounding those events, as a sport governing body we also realize that these alleged actions go far beyond the domain of sporting matters in a situation where the whole country is mired in civil war.\"\n\nFIFA is prevented from acting because of \"the limits of our jurisdiction and capacity to verify any allegations in such a complex setting,\" according to the statement.\n\nMark Afeeva, the London-based sports attorney who has written about how FIFA applies its independence statutes, said the evidence against Syria far surpasses other cases, including Nigeria, that have led FIFA to act. \"In any other context, FIFA would be almost eager to get involved,\" Afeeva says.\n\nAfeeva says FIFA \"has clearly taken the view that it's in its interests to not get involved\" in a political crisis that involves world powers, including the United States and Russia, the host of next year's World Cup. Taking action against Syria would require more institutional courage than FIFA has previously demonstrated, he says.\n\nSeoul, South Korea\n\nOn a cold night in March, the players from South Korea and Syria march single file into Seoul's World Cup Stadium, built before South Korea hosted the tournament in 2002. The 66,704-seat stadium puts to shame Syria's makeshift \"home\" in Malaysia. It features, among other amenities, a glowing roof designed to resemble a Korean paper kite. To support the home team -- nicknamed the Red Devils -- many fans wear blinking red horns. The Syrians are dressed in their familiar red warm-ups, only there's a major change: Firas al-Khatib's boycott is over. He returned a week earlier against Uzbekistan and is suited up again for a pivotal match against South Korea.\n\nKhatib and Syrian officials downplay the change. Khatib suggests that it was not his decision: \"Last time, they did not invite me to play,\" he says. Fadi Dabbas, the head of the delegation, says Khatib was \"welcome with the team at any time\" but \"his situation would not allow him to come.\"\n\nRegardless, it is clear that the striker is under a new master. The day before the match, after Khatib agrees to an interview with ESPN, Syrian officials hustle him into an elevator. It takes heated negotiations between ESPN and Syrian officials in the hotel lobby to finally produce the player.\n\n\"No politics,\" demands the team spokesman, Bashar Mohammad, who receives no guarantees.\n\nKhatib gives the impression that he has given up politics. \"We take the politics out and we talk about sport, just football,\" he says. \"I come back for a football decision, not politics.\"\n\nThe national team, he says, is \"for all the people, for all Syria,\" not just for the government. Continuing to sit back is no longer an option, he says: \"We can't stay and wait for how we die. No, we can't stay at home and look TV and wait what happened in this war. No, we must do something for our family, for our country, for our friends, for ourself.\"\n\nNot everyone buys it. The response on social media is mixed. Khatib says that 80 to 90 percent of Syrian fans are in favor of his coming back, but the messages on his Facebook page reveal deep reservoirs of betrayal:\n\n\"How does it feel exactly when you betray your country and your people? How does it feel when you betray Homs, whose people are fleeing horrific conditions, while you decided to go and stand by the regime? The least one can say about you is that you're a traitor.\"\n\n\"God damn you, you're not even worth an old shoe. I don't know why most of those who claim to be celebrities and actors in Syria are the dirtiest people on earth. You will pay in life before you pay in the afterlife. I spit on your honor, you dogs.\"\n\n\"What a shame, Firas. Your word is as good as that of a little boy. I spit on you, you liar.\"\n\nOthers are more forgiving. Mohammed al-Homsi, a media activist reached in the besieged neighborhood of Al Waer inside Homs, says he continues to follow the national team because \"generally speaking, sports is the only thing connecting us with the past. I won't say the Syrian team represents the entire Syrian spectrum, but it represents the beautiful past. Sports should be kept separate from conflict.\"\n\nKhatib, still acclimating to a team he has not led in five years, starts the game on the bench. South Korea takes a 1-0 lead in the fourth minute. The Syrians spend the rest of the night trying to claw their way back.\n\nKhatib enters early in the second half. Almost immediately, the pace of the game picks up as Syria goes on the attack. The stadium is about half full. The crowd, previously buoyant, is reduced to a nervous murmur as the Syrians repeatedly threaten.\n\nAs the clock ticks down, the ball, poetically, finds Khatib to the left of the net, alone. From a distance of about 10 feet, he blasts a left footer straight at the goalkeeper's head. The keeper, Sun-Tae Kwoun, manages to get his hands in front of his face at the last second and swats the ball away.\n\nIn stoppage time, with the crowd now screaming, Khatib gets one more chance. Alone again, in almost the exact same spot, he shoots another rocket, this time aiming higher. The ball thumps against the crossbar so hard the sound can be heard halfway up the stands. But it ricochets away.\n\nKhatib says he came back to try to lift Syria, if for only a moment, out of its unending hell. \"Finally I take the right decision,\" he says. \"I hope I can let the Syrian people [be] happy.\"\n\nBut not tonight. The 1-0 loss puts Syria four points out of third place with three games left, its World Cup hopes all but over.\n\nA week later, there is more news out of Syria, and it's indirectly related to Khatib's long-ago vow not to play as long Assad was killing civilians. This time the government has bombed the rebel-held village of Khan Sheikhoun with sarin, a chemical weapon. The images are horrific: Catatonic victims foam at the mouth, their pupils constricted to the size of pinpricks. Half-naked children lie helplessly in puddles, gasping for air.\n\nThe bombs kill at least 85 people.\n\nProducer Greg Amante of ESPN's Enterprise and Investigative Unit and correspondents Hwaida Saad, Ahmad Ajouz, Naseer Mehdawi, Kholoud Hassan, Hussain al-Qattari and Shahira Issa, and researcher Anthony Olivieri contributed to this report.\n\nSteve FainaruFainaru is a senior writer for ESPN Digital and Print Media.

    "raw_text": "Real Madrid's sprawling campus, called Ciudad Real Madrid, sits about 14 miles north of the city. On a Monday morning, the only people walking the property are security officers; the grounds are so quiet you can hear lawn mowers rumbling over distant soccer fields. The organization, famed for its privacy, shields its athletes from the outside world like hothouse flowers. Its players rarely give interviews before they turn 18.\n\nAfter practice, Doncic emerges from the gym in sweats and Jordans, tailed by Alyson, his American publicist, and Julio, a communications staffer from Real Madrid. In street clothes, his build is surprisingly dense; if Doncic had been born in Birmingham, Alabama, instead of Ljubljana, Slovenia, he might've played football. He shaved off his stubble in the days since his last game, and he looks apple-cheeked and angelic, like a boy in a Renaissance painting. When I point out the change in his appearance, Doncic, who speaks a fair amount of English (his Spanish is flawless), blushes.\n\n\"I seem like a baby without the beard,\" he says.\n\nJulio, dressed in a suit jacket with a tiny scarf knotted tight around his neck, a paperback copy of Winston Churchill's The Second World War in one hand, scurries to keep up with his charge. Doncic leads us to his car, an electric blue Porsche Panamera (\"the most beautiful car in the world,\" he jokes) with custom black rims. Before he turned 18, the legal driving age in Spain, his mother used to pick him up from practice.\n\nAfter stopping at a gas station -- Doncic ducks into the convenience store and pops out with an armload of Snickers bars for us -- we drive into Madrid. As Doncic careens around a turn, Julio shudders and rubs his glasses. Doncic glances at him and grins; like most teenagers, he has a gift for trolling the adults in his presence. \"I'm gonna switch to racing,\" he deadpans. He swipes through a few rap stations until he finds one playing reggaeton, then cranks it up. \"Why are you torturing us?\" Julio says. A few minutes later, Doncic sings a few unprintable lyrics from Migos' \"Bad and Boujee.\" And when Julio sighs, Doncic smiles sweetly, gesturing toward me. \"I listen with the American people,\" he says.\n\nTraffic slows as we cruise through the center of the city, and some of the pedestrians stare at Doncic's car. He points out a Five Guys, the American fast-food chain. \"It's amazing,\" he says. Two summers ago, Doncic spent two weeks in Santa Barbara, California, at P3, a sports science and workout facility that draws many NBA stars. The town reminded him of a Spanish village, he says. On the weekends, he took trips to Los Angeles with his mother and his girlfriend, who had flown in from Slovenia, visiting Hollywood Boulevard, Rodeo Drive (he was impressed by the giant Nike store nearby) and Six Flags. \"LA is amazing for me. I especially like the amazing cars,\" he says. \"I was at Venice Beach for ... what was the serial there, Baywatch? And it was amazing.\"\n\nAside from that trip, his only exposure to the States has been through American television. After watching all 10 seasons of Friends last summer, he's working his way through How I Met Your Mother and is keen on visiting New York. \"Central Park!\" he says. \"Drink coffee!\" He knows a couple of New York Knicks: Porzingis and Willy Hernangomez, who used to play for Real Madrid (in February, he'd be traded to Charlotte). Doncic says he mostly communicates with Hernangomez while playing the video game Call of Duty.\n\n\"I tried to play Call of Duty, and I got killed in one minute,\" Julio says.\n\nI ask Doncic whether he plans on adopting a nickname like Porzingis' Three Six Latvia, and he smiles mischievously. \"Swaggy L,\" he says.\n\nBoth Julio and Alyson groan.\n\n\"Swaggy ... LD,\" he suggests.\n\nDoncic parks his car in a garage, then leads us to one of his favorite restaurants in Madrid: the Hard Rock Cafe. He folds his massive frame into a seat in the corner, across from a rack of televisions playing Kiss videos. Julio and Alyson sit across from him, and his Spanish agent, a former Real Madrid player named Quique Villalobos, sits at a nearby table. A waiter approaches, wearing suspenders sagging under the weight of a dozen buttons. Doncic, speaking in Spanish, orders the Famous Fajitas (they're amazing, he tells me) and a plate of nachos. \"Con doble queso,\" he says.\n\nAfter his food arrives, I ask Doncic if he ever hears from NBA fans on social media. He nods, blushing again. \"Some of them write 'Tank for Luka,'\" he says. \"I don't know. I just laugh.\" When he looks at their handles, he can tell they're from cities like Chicago, Orlando, Phoenix, Dallas -- places he's never seen, much less pondered as part of his adult life. He's reluctant to talk about his future. Real Madrid's season is only halfway over, and some of the team's fans still believe he'll stay another year. \"You never know what can happen in the future,\" Doncic says, stealing a glance at Julio, who is staring at his phone. \"I want to concentrate on where I am.\"\n\nWhile Doncic is exceptionally vibrant on the court -- his games are punctuated by raucous celebrations and passionate fits, one of which recently resulted in an expulsion -- he betrays little emotion off of it, especially when pressed to discuss his own accomplishments. He's quick to deflect serious inquiries with dry humor.\n\nVillalobos describes him to me as guarded, the polar opposite, he says, of Dragic (the players use the same agency). I ask him how they're dissimilar.\n\n\"I'm prettier,\" Doncic interrupts.\n\nVillalobos rolls his eyes. \"He's much more private,\" he says. \"Goran? He shows love immediately. Luka needs to know you for five years.\"\n\nWhile we're talking, Alyson calls Dragic, who has stayed in touch with Doncic since EuroBasket, mentoring him as he prepares for the NBA. Seconds later, his beaming face appears on her phone. She hands it to Doncic, who prompts his friend to take off his hat and show him his new haircut. They chat in Slovenian for a minute, and Doncic bursts into laughter. After he hangs up, I ask him what Dragic told him.\n\n\"He said, 'We're losing in Miami, so you can come,'\" he says.\n\nThe first draft pick to go straight from Eastern Europe to the NBA was a Bulgarian named Georgi Glouchkov, a hulking forward known as the Balkan Banger who flamed out of the league after one season, 1985-86. For years afterward, the stereotype of European basketball players as slow and weak persisted, even as Toni Kukoc, Drazen Petrovic and Vlade Divac thrived in the NBA. Then in the early 2000s, the success of Mavericks draft pick Dirk Nowitzki spurred a run on foreign recruits: In 2003, NBA teams drafted a then-record 21 international prospects. At the time, league executives now concede, they were casting around blindly; many teams lacked the infrastructure to evaluate foreign players, as well as the savvy to help them ease into life in the States. While some of the players who came over became genuine stars, like Manu Ginobili and Pau Gasol, the botched draft picks cast an oversized shadow. Kwame Brown's failure doesn't hang over American prospects the way Milicic's story lingers for Eastern Europeans.\n\nYears passed. Prospects improved. In 2013, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert entered the league; a year later, Dario Saric, Jusuf Nurkic and Clint Capela were drafted. The recent surge in European imports is no accident, according to Maurizio Gherardini, a former assistant GM in Toronto who is now the GM of Fenerbahce, Turkey's EuroLeague team. \"It reflects a progressive change in approach -- NBA clubs are ready to absorb the talent coming in,\" he says.\n\nOthers point to an evolution in the NBA itself. \"I think it helped that along the way, the rules changed,\" Nowitzki says. After the league outlawed aggressive, physical play, the NBA's focus moved from power to finesse, shifting closer to the international game. \"All of that obviously plays into the hands of some Europeans,\" he says.\n\nEven so, some teams are still apprehensive about picking Europeans near the top of the draft. While few would admit to typecasting foreigners, it's undeniable that they're more familiar with college stars. One executive speculates that his peers are more afraid of picking a European bust than an American one, simply because people will make a bigger deal out of it. Another says it can be hard to persuade owners, who are quick to bring up names like Bargnani. \"It's like not seeing a movie because you saw one five years ago that sucked -- and you haven't seen one since,\" the executive says. \"If they follow college basketball, they're so much more comfortable with the known.\"\n\nIronically, Doncic might be the most known quantity in basketball. \"He's been seen, studied, evaluated by everyone,\" says Gherardini, who jokes, \"I was aware of him since he was born!\" Given his age, Doncic's production is almost unprecedented; rotations in the EuroLeague run deeper than they do in the NBA, which makes it hard for young players to tally meaningful minutes. (Several executives told me that the typical EuroLeague team would crush collegiate competition.) According to ESPN's Kevin Pelton, Doncic has the highest wins above replacement player (WARP) projection of any European prospect since 2006, when data became available. Based on Pelton's calculations, which take into account age and how other European prospects' statistics have translated to NBA production, Doncic's WARP projection isn't just higher than Ricky Rubio's and Nikola Jokic's -- it's also the highest projection on record, even besting that of a young Anthony Davis.\n\nBy the numbers alone, Doncic is practically a sure thing.\n\nBut among league insiders, the question isn't whether the Slovenian teenager will bust -- almost no one thinks that. Rather, it's whether his ceiling is high enough to justify drafting him above the likes of Deandre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III. While Doncic is hardly plodding, he isn't exceptionally quick or strong. \"His body is physically mature, so you worry about how much more it can change -- how much upside he can have,\" says one front office staffer. When teams have sent their best athletes to stop him, he's struggled at times to break free. On the other side of the ball, he's a diligent defender, but he isn't agile enough to keep up with nimble guards.\n\nAnd yet, when NBA insiders criticize Doncic's game, they're quick to add that they're nitpicking. He might be limited on defense, but he can still play multiple spots on the floor, sliding seamlessly into the league's amorphous lineups. When Doncic has the ball, it feels like he's been given a flashlight while everyone else on the court is fumbling in the dark; he sees passing angles before they materialize, making him deadly in the pick-and-roll. \"His game is much older than his age,\" explains one front office higher-up. \"All of the stupid clich\u00e9s you're gonna hear? It's because they're all true.\" Doncic's shooting percentages have declined over the course of the long season -- 31 percent from 3, 47 percent overall through April 5 -- but his mechanics are sound, suggesting fatigue and shot selection might be undermining his natural ability.\n\nIn December, during a EuroLeague game against Belgrade's Crvena Zvezda, Doncic doesn't seem tired, but his lack of speed shows up at times. When he hustles back on defense, he lumbers a bit, footsteps thudding on the floor. It would be absurd to call him unathletic, but he isn't graceful; he uses his body to carve out space like a person butting into a conversation.\n\nThen, just when one is tempted to make too much of this apparent lack of finesse, something clicks. Real Madrid weaves together a series of screens and Doncic cuts inside, then sinks a jumper. A couple of possessions after that, he disrupts a shot and sprints across the court, dunking off a lob and dangling from the rim for a moment like a fish wriggling on a hook. (\"He likes doing that,\" murmurs his agent, Bill Duffy, who is sitting to my left.) Seconds later, he shakes a defender and hits a step-back 3, then a pair of free throws, then one more 3-pointer.\n\nIn five minutes, Doncic has scored 12 points.\n\nWhen the second quarter begins, Doncic's scoring slows, and the howling in the arena subsides -- until he pulls off a move so astonishing, I didn't realize what actually happened until I returned to the States and re-watched the tape. A few minutes in, he dribbles behind the arc, where he's double-teamed by a pair of Serbian team defenders. They close in on him, raising their arms like children pretending to be mummies. When Doncic tries to elude them, he falls backward and, in the process of tumbling, lobs the ball more than 25 feet to an open teammate in the low post, setting him up to score.\n\nThe announcer giggles. There isn't much to say.",

    "raw_text": "The inaugural Women's Hockey India League saw just four teams and 13 matches over two weeks period, but there's hardly any doubt that it was a step in the right direction. For years, the Indian women hockey players deserved a league of the highest quality, they didn't get it the first time the HIL happened between 2013 and 2017, and then had to wait for eight more years to get a shot at it. It has been a long wait but now the hope is that it becomes a permanent fixture for many years.\n\nHere's why the league matters and what more can be done in the upcoming years:\n\nYoungsters playing under pressure and performing\n\nOn Sunday, Odisha Warriors' 22-year-old Rutuja Pisal, who is yet to make her senior India debut, was the star of the final, scoring twice against JSW Soorma Hockey Club, in helping her team win the trophy. If anything, it's validation of why this league matters. She would've never gotten a chance to perform under pressure until she featured for the Indian team in an important tournament. That fact that she got the opportunity to play in such high pressure and then score such big goals will certainly boost her confidence.\n\nWhile Rutuja stood out for her heroics in the final, there are other youngsters who would've benefitted massively by playing in high pressure and such a high-quality final. Hina Bano, Sakshi Rana, Sonam, et al, might not make it to the national squad in the near future, but when they do, they will be more prepared to play at that level than some of their predecessors were.\n\nGood start but WHIL needs to expand\n\nThe issue was very much on the cards since the announcement was made. Four teams and 12 matches are too short. The good news is that Hockey India is committed to increase the number of teams. While eight may be a touch too many, six teams will work for the players, and will also serve to preserve the quality of hockey.\n\nIdeally, more foreign players and Indian talent should make their way to the league. Even players from countries like China and Japan will help in improving the standards along with the traditional powerhouse like the Netherlands and Australia.\n\nNow the question is if the league is increasing the number of teams, will there be another megaauction? If not, the new teams will start from a disadvantageous position because the top players have already been picked by the existing teams.\n\nAlso, the auction purse for each team should be higher. It's understandable that Hockey India wanted to keep the costs low in the first year but the salary paid to the foreign players should be attractive enough for them to want to play in the league.\n\nMore teams, more matches but less training?\n\nAfter the final on Sunday, Janneke Schopman said the flip side of playing more matches is having less training time with players. \"It was tough with the travel and games so condensed. Like I said to someone, it's nice if Indian players have more training time in theory, so they can learn from foreign players more. We had two rest days before the final, I was happy with that.\"\n\nShe clarified that she's not against more stadia hosting the league...\"but you also need rest. We traveled six hours to Rourkela and had to play the next day. It's tough on the body for the girls. The road isn't great, and the trains were sometimes delayed. It's not the easiest travel. When you take that into account...\"\n\nSchopman has a point. No coach will be happy with fewer training sessions, with rest and recovery being important aspects in between a tournament. A one-month window means the schedule will be packed for all teams. If in the future, Hockey India decide on a home and away format, then it will be a tougher challenge. Hockey India needs to start working on a plan right away and the details need to be worked in a way in the best interests of all the stakeholders.\n\nWhat about Indian dragflickers and goalkeepers?\n\nPenalty corners have been an issue with Indian women's hockey for quite sometime now. The hope was to find decent dragflick options apart from Deepika but that didn't happen. Even Deepika was ordinary with her dragflick conversions, scoring just one goal for Delhi SG Pipers.\n\nThen there was also question of Indian goalkeepers making a mark in the league. After Savita, there's Bichu Devi, but other than these two, there are not many quality options. While it's good news for India as long as Savita continues to play, they need more options.\n\nIn the whole tournament, only Savita and Bichu Devi got to play consistently. Considering it was a short league with just six matches per team, it was difficult for other young Indian goalkeepers to get any playing time.",

    "raw_text": "Editor's note: This story was originally published on Nov. 14, 2018. Watch the Chiefs and Rams' 2018 classic Monday at 8 p.m. ET on ESPN.\n\nI went to the bottom of the internet trying to understand what it's like to have an arm like Patrick Mahomes'. I found a throw so rare that it technically doesn't exist, erased on account of a holding penalty. November 2014. Mahomes is a 19-year-old true freshman at Texas Tech, facing Oklahoma, in only his second start. It's third-and-10 at the Sooners' 39-yard line. He's been coached to look at a pair of receivers in sequence and, if they're both covered, make a play. One, two, go. He takes the snap and is under immediate pressure -- \"one, go\" -- and he scampers left, not fast but elusive, away from the rush but into a trap. He's within a yard of the sideline and all four Sooners defensive linemen are closing fast ... until, with his weight moving left and a rusher's helmet at his chin, Mahomes snaps his arm -- in that instant, it's his only body part in motion, as if isolated for maximum effect -- and the ball assumes a trajectory that seems impossible without more of a windup, the physical expression of a metaphysical quality, a radical confidence known only by a blessed few. The ball hisses; it spirals fast and tight; it seems to alter the physics and change the possibilities of a football field -- hovering low as it sails across and deep -- until it sticks to a receiver's chest in the end zone as Mahomes hits the ground. I watched that throw 20 times. I saw improvisatory football genius and sheer stones. I saw a man making calculations and assessing risks I couldn't compute. I watched the throw until I was certain of what I was looking at.\n\nAnd then I sat down with him and raved about passes like it. And he took the compliments with a dull stare, as if none of what I attributed to it ever occurred to him. It was just a throw. A throw he always makes -- and has made since he first held a ball.\n\nIn any given generation, there are only a handful of truly transcendent arms. These guys are born, not made. If you don't have it, you still can be a good NFL quarterback if not paid like a great one. If you have it and waste it, you'll be a 30 for 30. But if you have it and don't waste it, and combine it with an Academic All-American's mind and a craftsman's work ethic -- well, that's what I want to explore with Mahomes.\n\nOn an October afternoon in an office at the Chiefs' facility, Mahomes doesn't look like he wants to be explored. He looks explored out, polite but also maybe existentially exhausted from having his life change forever this season. He is 23 years old, without even 16 games under his belt, and he has a game-worn jersey in the Hall of Fame and leads the league (through Week 9) in touchdowns and yards and is second in passer rating. It's been a year. Most impressive, he has normalized the impossible, making throws each week that defy reason and kinesiology.\n\nThe other day, in Mahomes' apartment in the Country Club Plaza neighborhood of Kansas City, his grandfather asked him, \"What's it like to be famous?\" For one thing, it means he eats less ketchup. He spent most of his life putting ketchup on everything. He would get bottles of it for his birthday. But now that everyone is watching every move he makes, he is sheepish about ordering ketchup. At a restaurant recently, his mom, Randi, recognized an unfilled desire as he dove into a steak. \"Just ask for it,\" Randi said. \"I know you want it.\" Patrick wouldn't. So she asked for the ketchup and slipped it to him.\n\nBut the intersection of fame and ketchup is a story for another time. We're here to talk about his arm, so I ask him a question I know better than to ask an obsessive technician like Tom Brady, for example.\n\n\"Have you ever had to think about throwing?\"\n\nMahomes normally talks fast, and sounds rehearsed, praising his coaches and teammates, but he pauses now, as if this is the first time he's thought about thinking about how much he thinks about his gifts, and says:\n\n\"Not a lot.\"\n\nI'm standing with John Elway as we watch Mahomes warm up at Arrowhead Stadium before the Chiefs play the Broncos in late October. Mahomes rolls left and throws deep right, then rolls right and throws deep left. He tosses it 60 yards without a strain or grunt. He looks like he's goofing around -- even checks his phone between reps -- but this is actual practice. In games, he makes those throws. A few Broncos coaches watch Mahomes, seduced by the spectacle of it all. He has skills at his command that are the envy of anyone who's ever played quarterback, and if you've ever thrown a ball well enough to have an idea of how hard it is to do what he does, it's even more fascinating and thrilling and full of lovely subtleties, like the angle at which the nose rises and falls, how the ball seems to gain speed with distance rather than lose it, violent yet catchable. These passes change more than a game's momentum. They suspend time, forcing you to look up from your phone and making you wonder what it feels like to unleash such force. Elway knows.\n\nI ask Elway, \"When your arm was its strongest, what was it like to throw?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he says. He chews on it for a second and gives me a football version of the \"I could always just play\" scene in \"Good Will Hunting.\" \"You just feel like you can do anything.\"\n\nTo succeed in the NFL, most players have to come to terms with their limits. You learn to work within and against them. But if you are born with an arm like Mahomes' or Elway's, it allows you the blessing of never having to reconsider yourself -- unless, of course, a few painful postseason losses force you to reconsider everything.\n\nMahomes might not think a lot about his own throwing, but many close to him have spent a lot of time thinking of ways to get him to slow down. His father, Pat, was a pitcher for 11 years in the majors, and the family often lived in apartments and hotel rooms in cities where he played. As a toddler, Patrick would go to the ballpark with his dad for batting practice and then come home, watch the game on TV and throw during commercial breaks. It was fun and exhausting. Randi would toss a ball into a corner or down the hall, hoping to buy herself a few moments of peace. \"I thought, 'I can read one more paragraph of this book until he gets the ball,' \" she says.\n\nWhen Randi and Pat signed Patrick up for T-ball in their hometown of Tyler, Texas, the 4-year-old was so advanced he was traded for two players -- Texas sports, man -- and moved up to play coach-pitch with older kids. At the first practice, he scooped a ground ball at shortstop and fired to first, hitting the first baseman between the eyes and shattering his glasses. \"I thought everybody could catch,\" Mahomes says now, laughing.\n\nThe challenge of Mahomes' childhood was the challenge of the gifted. How best to teach him? Should you even try? Pat tried to build his son's arm strength through an array of baseball drills, beginning with long tosses and moving toward throws from different platforms, with both feet parallel or one foot planted the wrong way, hoping to help Patrick find his most powerful release point. Turns out, every release point was powerful. He not only intuitively threw at varying angles -- could throw classically, or at three-quarters, or from his hip -- he intuitively saw varying angles and the best way for a ball to reach its target. \"It turned out to be a perfect storm,\" Pat says. When Patrick was nearing middle school, he started to play football in the backyard with friends. One day, he threw as hard as he could to his dad. It's a throw Pat still remembers a decade later, not only because of its force but because it was a declaration of sorts. His son would chart his own path.\n\n\"It felt like the nose of the football went through my hands,\" Pat says.\n\nMahomes has the type of arm that can lead to assumptions. When he was a kid, he entered a summer football camp wearing a baseball hat turned backward. Adam Cook, the camp's quarterbacks coach and later Patrick's head coach at Whitehouse High and now one of his best friends, decided to test him. He had heard of Patrick's arm strength and low release point -- coaches tend to see a three-quarter release as the knee-steering of throwing motions, careless and too cool -- and thought most kids with that resume were spoiled know-it-alls. Cook approached him and said, \"Hey, turn your hat around so I can talk to you.\"\n\nPatrick turned around his hat, no questions asked. Although his talent has always meant the game has come easily to him, at heart he's a conformist who is grounded and eager to work. \"Dad, I just want to be coached,\" he would tell Pat.\n\nIn middle school, he worked with a coach named Reno Moore, who would ask Patrick to lie on the ground next to a football and, when Moore gave the word, jump up and throw to one of three holes on a stand-up net to quicken his release. \"His pure arm strength was phenomenal,\" Moore says. \"He'd make you pull out your hair trying to get him to be exact on his footwork and timing, but finally we just said he's good enough to do some things that are special.\"\n\n\u0093His pure arm strength was phenomenal. God didn't give out many arms like that.\u0094\n\n- Adam Cook, Mahomes' high school coach\n\nAt Whitehouse High, Adam Cook and his brother, Brad, the offensive coordinator, called a lot of quick screens and marveled at how fast the ball came out of Mahomes' hand. Years later, Brad analyzed all of Mahomes' quick screens and found that he released the ball in 0.58 of a second, compared with an average of 0.67 for all Whitehouse quarterbacks since. Adam Cook's son, Sam, was a ball boy during Mahomes' years, and he idolized Patrick -- not just because Patrick went out of his way to make him feel part of the team, or because Patrick would remember teammates' birthdays and ask coaches to announce them at practice, but because he wondered what it was like to have that arm. \"You watch him make plays and think, 'Maybe I could do something like that,' \" Sam says.\n\nBut of course, he couldn't. Nobody could. \"God didn't give out many arms like that,\" Adam Cook says.\n\nThe arm has given Mahomes the blessing or curse of never having to be desperate. All of the future Hall of Fame quarterbacks today have faced a moment in their lives when football could have moved on without them. The closest Mahomes came to that was during an Elite 11 contest in high school. He was tired and raw; he had pitched five innings the day before. He failed to qualify. Cook was angry. Pat Sr. was really angry. Was Patrick angry? Was that his signature scar, a moment -- like Tom Brady's draft slide or Drew Brees' shoulder injury or Aaron Rodgers' failure to get a single Division I offer out of high school -- that becomes lore in retrospect? No. \"East Texas isn't known for producing quarterbacks,\" he shrugs. \"I was never really on the football circuit. I wasn't the type of guy that put my name out there.\"\n\nHis arm gave him confidence that it would all work out. During his senior football season, in 2013, he threw for 50 touchdowns and ran for 15 more. Baseball chased him, but he was bored with the game and told teams he would play only for a $2.5 million bonus, a figure he later told The Kansas City Star he had invented just to dissuade them. Football gave him a platform, a blank canvas on every play. He loves \"the daily grind of dissecting and learning about defenses. Just having a new challenge every week.\" In a playoff game against Poteet High, Mahomes spun away from linebacker Malik Jefferson, who now plays for the Bengals, and launched a deep pass down the right sideline for a touchdown. Pat Sr. later called it the most memorable play of his son's career -- and noted it's the type of play Patrick has made \"his whole life.\" Watch Mahomes roll away from the Patriots' rush and launch a 67-yard touchdown to Kareem Hunt and you know what he means.\n\nKliff Kingsbury sits at the head of a large conference table on an October Thursday. We're in the Texas Tech football building. A framed Mahomes jersey hangs on one wall in his office, and a Mahomes painting leans against another. Few people in America know quarterbacks like the Red Raiders' head coach. He was a star at Texas Tech, studied behind Brady and Brees in the NFL, and coached Case Keenum and Johnny Manziel in college. NFL coaches shamelessly steal from his playbook. Andy Reid recently told Sports Illustrated he was a \"genius.\"\n\n\"He's just being nice,\" Kingsbury says. \"He feels grateful to me for making sure Patrick is alive and didn't die in college.\"\n\nHe turns on video of Mahomes in college, looking very alive, offering a familiar display of the spectacular. Mahomes rolls right and throws 30 yards like he's skipping a stone. \"Most humans can't do that,\" Kingsbury says. Mahomes wings a deep out like he's throwing a Frisbee forehanded. \"The rest of us strain to throw the balls he throws,\" he says. \"I never saw him strain, ever. Didn't matter how far downfield.\"\n\nI press Kingsbury for an evolution in Mahomes' release, arguing that it has to have changed. I mean, Brady and Rodgers have reinvented their motions, if not themselves, over the years. Kingsbury coached Mahomes to carry the ball higher, but that was it. \"There was a purity to it,\" Kingsbury says. In three years in Lubbock, Mahomes never had a bad day throwing. He was never off.\n\nSo maybe it's no surprise that Mahomes grew bored with Mahomes. Maybe that's how it goes when you set an NCAA record with 819 yards of total offense in a single game, or when you routinely launch 85-yard passes in pregame warm-ups. Kingsbury had to be creative to keep coaching him. A few days each week, he would set up nets with three targets and join Mahomes and Tech's backup quarterback, Nic Shimonek, in a quarterback version of H-O-R-S-E. The games got heated and insane, with the quarterbacks bouncing footballs off the goalposts or over the crossbar. Kingsbury ended up winning a lot -- he had the best touch -- but one day, for kicks, they mixed in left-handed throws. Soon it became part of the routine. Kingsbury and Shimonek were the only people in America not falling off their couches when Mahomes, running left and with Von Miller at his ankles against the Broncos in Week 4, transferred the ball from his right to his left hand and tossed it to Tyreek Hill for a first down. \"It was practiced,\" Kingsbury says.\n\nHe is trying to tell me that there was an evolution. I'm just looking for it in the wrong place. Most quarterbacks go to college to learn how to play in the NFL. Mahomes went to learn how to throw left-handed.\n\nAt the beginning of each year, Mike Sheppard, a former college head coach and assistant under Bill Belichick and Mike Holmgren, drives a short distance from his house in the San Clemente hills to the Exos facility in Carlsbad to join another coach and friend of his, Bill Cunerty, to prepare quarterbacks for the draft. For six weeks in 2017, Mahomes was a client. Sheppard has known Andy Reid since the late '70s, when he saw him at Glendale Community College and brought him to BYU, where Reid ended up meeting his wife, Tammy, and launching his coaching career.\n\nOne day between the 2017 NFL combine and the draft, Reid called Sheppard to ask about Mahomes. \"I'm just doing some due diligence,\" he said. \"I won't keep you long.\"\n\nSheppard had a binder full of Mahomes notes. He had listed 11 items as \"Improvements,\" from \"snap count\" to \"drawing TTU protections\" to \"two hands on the ball.\" But it was revelatory for what it lacked: There was almost nothing in his notes about Mahomes' release. Quarterback coaches love to credit themselves for cleaning up the motions of top prospects during draft season, but Sheppard instead told Reid, \"There are a lot of strong arms but not as accurate.\"\n\nReid tried to mask his enthusiasm. How was Patrick to coach? Did he listen? Does the material transfer easily? Sheppard had his own theory to gauge a quarterback's intelligence. If a quarterback has great grades, Sheppard knows he's a grinder. Patrick was an Academic All-American, Big 12 scholar-athlete of the year and a regular on the dean's and president's lists. \"He's a good student and hard worker,\" he said.\n\nCalls like this usually last about 15 minutes. This one lasted 45. \"It took some time to get through the checklist,\" Reid says now, straight-faced.\n\n\"Andy was excited about him,\" Sheppard says, \"but he didn't want anyone to know.\"\n\nMahomes suspected it. Before the draft, Reid interviewed Mahomes in Kansas City. It was a six-hour meeting. \"We tried to bury him\" in football minutiae, Reid would say later. He knows better than most that it's possible to produce an outstanding coaching career with good quarterbacks but almost impossible to win a Super Bowl without a transcendent one. In the end, the fit between them felt right. Despite the draft-day groupthink by many other teams -- Mahomes was too raw, his ungodly statistics in Texas Tech's offense were untrustworthy, Mitch Trubisky was the superior prospect -- the Chiefs climbed 17 picks to select him 10th overall.\n\nOnce Mahomes was a Chief, Reid learned that the strength in his arm didn't come just from his arm. It also came from his wrist. \"He just kinda flicks it,\" Reid says. When Patrick was learning how to throw, Pat Sr. always told him to \"get his wrists involved.\" Pat wanted his son's fastballs to have the sensation of rising -- \"His wrists just got stronger,\" he says -- but he had no idea that it would come together in moments like it did in the third quarter against the Jaguars in Week 5. Mahomes scooted up in the pocket, but his cleats caught on the turf. He threw with his feet shoulder-width apart, without a windup or follow-through, like he threw a dart. The ball hit tight end Travis Kelce in stride 25 yards downfield -- a throw that forces you to wonder, with sincere hyperbolism, if a generational quarterback doesn't stop himself, can he be unstoppable?\n\nMahomes is standing at his locker after the late-October Broncos game, pulling on a white sweater. He has only one locker right now, rather than the customary two for superstars -- we all need things to strive for -- but he looks comfortable and at home around the guys after a win, just like visiting his dad in a big league clubhouse. He threw four touchdown passes but left plenty of plays on the field, including one when he rolled right and had Hill open on a post, running across and away, a throw the Chiefs would've never called for Alex Smith. But Mahomes saw Hill too late. Around the corner is a private party the Chiefs host for friends and family after every home game, and Patrick is in a hurry to see his folks. It all reminds me a little of Tom Brady in 2001, the mystical embryonic stage of something special. Pat and Randi have the adrenalized exhaustion Tom Sr. and Galynn Brady had back then, flying across the country every weekend, on a ride they had to soak up because nobody knew when it would end. \"I might skip Cleveland,\" Pat Sr. said the night before the Broncos game of the Chiefs' upcoming opponent, before thinking better of it. \"Nah, I'll go to Cleveland.\"\n\nNobody knows where Kansas City's season will end, but it's well-known that for the Chiefs and for Reid over the past two decades, it has ended early. Mahomes is a limitless quarterback leading a historically limited team. The Chiefs have been careful with him publicly, at once allowing him to be celebrated but trying to limit the toll, not wanting the hype to short-circuit what could be their year. Right now, at least, Mahomes is immune to the doubt that creeps into teams that always come up short -- that even crept into Elway in the years after he learned a wondrous arm alone gets a team only so far. Fear is his biggest enemy. In the Kansas City offices, I ask Mahomes whether there's some highlight he goes back to when he needs a lift.\n\n\"I never really watch anything that helps me get a confidence boost,\" he says. \"I pretty much just keep it moving and keep it rolling. I feel like even if something goes wrong, I have confidence in myself and my team that we'll fix it. Our team thing is, Let's Roll. Whatever happens, I'll bounce back.\"\n\nImagine living that way, perpetually liberated. Maybe someday later in his career Mahomes will have to try to recapture that feeling, when some inevitability of the NFL sets in. Or maybe not. Maybe a rare arm allows for an even rarer mind.\n\nIn the fourth quarter against the Broncos, the Chiefs were up 10, but Denver was slowly creeping back into the game. Mahomes started to scramble but threw to Kelce high and hard and into the arms of Broncos safety Justin Simmons. Mahomes headed to the bench, irritated but not crushed. Four plays later, the Chiefs forced a Keenum fumble, and Mahomes leapt off the bench, hugged a few defensive players and yelled, \"Thanks for picking me up!\" Then he snatched the ball from them and started warming up, his release fluid and clean and on point, all that is required of him and all that he has ever required of himself.\n\nMahomes never told me what it feels like to make extraordinary throws, only intimating that those throws don't feel extraordinary to him. That's the gap between him and 99 percent of the men and boys who will drop back into a pocket this fall.\n\nBut the 99 percent can have a taste. In mid-October, Sam Cook made a throw he'll remember for the rest of his life. The ball boy is now a freshman-team quarterback at Whitehouse High, playing on the same field his hero did, and in a game against Jacksonville, he danced left and saw a receiver running to the right. It's the throw -- late and over the middle -- quarterbacks are told never to try. But Sam couldn't resist the chance, not just to hit a pass but to hit a Mahomes pass, with all its danger and glory. He threw like Patrick, a quick three-quarter release, and hit his man for a big gain as the crowd exploded. A current shot through him like lightning. \"Nothing like that feeling,\" Sam told me later, still buzzing.\n\nDoes Mahomes know that feeling, or is he unaffected by the rush? He had to leave the office in the Chiefs' facility before I could ask. But my bet is that he knows. And that the game for him now is to never stop to think about it.\n\nMore Stories",

    "raw_text": "The 2025 WNBA offseason has arrived and there will be a number of trades and free-agent signings that impact the league. These moves also have an effect on fantasy women's basketball rosters.\n\nThe flurry of activity began with the blockbuster deal that sent Jewell Loyd to the Las Vegas Aces and Kelsey Plum to the Los Angeles Sparks, followed by Alyssa Thomas being traded from the Connecticut Sun to the Phoenix Mercury and former Mercury center Brittney Griner signing with the Atlanta Dream, all in a three-day span.\n\nWhile there's still plenty of time before the WNBA draft in April, our fantasy analysts will break down the biggest offseason moves right here. Check back often for the latest analysis, as well our initial fantasy women's basketball rankings for the 2025 season.\n\nBrittney Griner agrees to one-year deal with Atlanta Dream\n\nMoody: Griner was one of two players to average 15.0 points per game while shooting at least 50% from the field and 40% from 3-point range last season (albeit on only 18 attempts from deep). The 34-year-old, 10-time All-Star remains an impactful player, leaving Phoenix as the franchise career leader in blocks (812), rebounds (2,322) and field goal percentage (56.2%).\n\nGriner averaged 17.8 PPG, 6.6 RPG and 1.5 BPG for the Mercury in 2024. She also averaged 14.0 field goal attempts per game, the seventh-highest mark in the league and shot a league-best 71% in the paint. Griner should provide a huge boost to a Dream offense that shot just 51% in the paint last season, the second-worst mark of any team.\n\nExpect Griner to be an immediate contributor in Atlanta, playing alongside Rhyne Howard -- a two-time All-Star and the 2022 Rookie of the Year -- and veteran guard Allisha Gray. Atlanta should rely more on post play this season with Griner in the frontcourt, as she led the league with 357 post-ups last year, per Second Spectrum.\n\nGriner remains a top-35 fantasy player and one of the best centers, ranking just behind A'ja Wilson, Jonquel Jones, Aliyah Boston, Nneka Ogwumike and Ezi Magbegor.\n\nTrade: Alyssa Thomas, Tyasha Harris to Mercury, Natasha Cloud, Rebecca Allen to Sun\n\nMoody: The Phoenix Mercury acquire five-time All-Star forward Thomas from the Connecticut Sun. The trade also sends Cloud, Allen and the No. 12 pick in the 2025 draft to Connecticut with Harris headed to Phoenix.\n\nThomas has spent her entire 10-year career with the Sun and averaged 10.6 PPG, 8.4 RPG and 7.9 APG last season. She leaves Connecticut as the most accomplished player in franchise history, holding records for the most games played, assists, rebounds and steals, while ranking second in scoring behind Nykesha Sales. Thomas also leads the WNBA in career triple-doubles. The No. 4 overall pick in the 2014 draft finished top 5 in MVP voting in each of the past two seasons.\n\nThomas is widely regarded as one of the league's most complete players and a top-tier defender, earning six All-WNBA Defensive Team selections. She led the league last season with 876 passes that created shot attempts, making her a highly effective facilitator. This skill set will greatly benefit the Mercury, who averaged just 66.1 passes per game leading to a shot attempt -- the fourth fewest in the league. Thomas will elevate Phoenix's ball movement and offensive efficiency.\n\nShe is an ideal fit for head coach Nate Tibbetts' spread offense, a system that prioritizes spacing, fast tempo and quick ball movement. This style creates driving lanes and open perimeter shots, exploiting mismatches and putting defenses on their heels. While Thomas isn't known for elite scoring, she has the ability to elevate her teammates, which now includes Kahleah Copper and Sophie Cunningham, and her presence should strengthen the Mercury on both ends of the court.\n\nAs for the Sun, Thomas' departure pushes Connecticut into a rebuilding phase. Former head coach Stephanie White left for the Indiana Fever, and the Sun had just four players under contract for 2025 before adding Cloud and Allen in the deal. With Thomas gone, it's unlikely veterans like DeWanna Bonner and Brionna Jones will stick around.\n\nHowever, one player that stands to benefit from all the change is Marina Mabrey, who averaged 14.9 PPG, 3.5 RPG and 3.4 APG last season and could emerge as a key contributor for the Sun in 2025.\n\nKelsey Plum joins Sparks, Jewell Loyd joins Aces in blockbuster trade\n\nSnellings: Plum's fantasy value goes through the roof with this trade. The Sparks are a team that has exciting young talent in the frontcourt, but that had huge holes in the backcourt. They were last in the WNBA in team offensive rating last season, 10th in team assists (19.7 APG), 11th in turnovers (15.0 TO) and 10th in 3-point percentage (32.0 3P%). Plum brings them one of the best backcourt offense-generators in the WNBA, and on top of that comes from a team overcrowded with creators to one where she should get all of the touches and opportunities she can handle.\n\nWith the Aces, Plum was tenth in the WNBA in scoring (17.8 PPG) while playing next to the leading scorer in the league in A'ja Wilson (26.9 PPG). She was 13th in the league in assists (4.2 APG) while playing with two other teammates in the top 10 in (Jackie Young 5.3 APG, Chelsea Gray 4.9 APG). Plum's usage should be much higher this season, with the likelihood of new career-highs in scoring (current career-high 20.2 PPG), assists (5.1 APG) and 3-pointers (3.1 3PG) all on deck.\n\nI had Plum ranked 21st in my Way Too Early rankings last fall, but with this trade she moves up to the back of the top-10.\n\nCourtney Vandersloot expected to return to the Chicago Sky\n\nMoody: Vandersloot will make her Chicago homecoming after spending the past two seasons with the New York Liberty, where she helped them win their first WNBA title in 2024.\n\nThe veteran guard spent 12 seasons with the Sky after being drafted third overall, helping them secure their first and only championship in 2021 alongside Candace Parker and Allie Quigley. Vandersloot is a five-time WNBA All-Star and a five-time All-WNBA selection and remains the Sky's all-time leader in assists.\n\nLast season, she came off the bench for the Liberty, averaging 6.4 PPG and 4.8 APG in just 22.3 MPG. Looking for a team that values her contributions, Vandersloot will have the opportunity to maximize the years she has left in the league with Chicago. She's likely to step into a starting role and help launch a new era of Sky basketball alongside young stars Angel Reese and Kamilla Cardoso.\n\nFrom a fantasy perspective, Vandersloot provides points and assists, and is just 385 assists away from surpassing Sue Bird as the WNBA's all-time leader. However, she is not a reliable three-point shooter, which remains a key area the Sky must address this offseason.\n\nVandersloot ranks just inside the top 50 and is best drafted as a second or third guard, depending on roster construction.",

    "raw_text": "India beat Thailand 13-0 in the women's Asian Champions Trophy in Rajgir, Bihar to qualify for the semifinals, after an impressive attacking display.\n\nDeepika scored five goals, including two dragflicks from penalty corners. There was a brace each for Preeti Dubey, Lalremsiami and Manisha Chauhan, and also goals for Beauty Dungdung and Navneet Kaur, as Harendra Singh's team piled on the goals against a Thailand side who had conceded 15 goals to China earlier in the competition.\n\nIndia got off to the perfect start in the first quarter with a fierce reverse hit from Deepika in the third minute to give them the lead. Preeti and Lalremsiami added to that tally in the first 15 minutes, with finishes from close range, as the game already seemed to be beyond Thailand at the halfway point of the first half.\n\nIndia scored two more in the second quarter. First, Deepika scored her second goal of the evening, with a lovely finish after having her back to goal. She somehow spun and lashed the ball into the top corner. Right at the end of the half, Udita's slap from a penalty corner led to a big goalmouth scramble, before Beauty eventually poked the ball home from close range.\n\nIn the second half, India scored four times from penalty corners, with Deepika converting two powerful dragflicks, and Manisha Chauhan adding one of her own. Lalremsiami also scored her second goal with a clever deflection from Udita's slap.\n\nPreeti's second goal of the evening came after a lovely through ball from Vaishnavi Phalke, which allowed her to round the goalkeeper and then roll home into an empty net. Manisha scored a second goal which she mishit after going through one-on-one with the goalkeeper.\n\nNavneet too got on the scoresheet with a powerful reverse hit that gave the Thai keeper no chance.\n\nIndia will now face two stiff tests before the semifinals, with games against China and Japan, but this now seems to be a team riding high on confidence. Harendra would be most pleased with their finishing and their penalty corner conversions, which enabled them to score 13 goals even without their main goalscorer Sangita Kumari getting on the scoresheet.\n\nYou can relive the match right here:",

    "raw_text": "The second decade of the Pro Kabaddi League begins on the 18th of October, signalling the maturing of the league into arguably the most popular franchise sport in India after the IPL. PKL 11 brings with it a whole host of changes, including revamped squads following the player auctions in August, and a few format changes as well.\n\nWith the squads newly refreshed, there are murmurs that we could witness one of the most competitive seasons of Pro Kabaddi yet, and this bodes well after Puneri Paltan's dominant road to the title last year.\n\nHere's what to look forward to in PKL 11.\n\nKabaddi home | PKL 11: Full coverage\n\nWhat's new?\n\nWe'll get to the squads later, but the headline change is a shift from the 12-city caravan format and return to a three-legged affair. The first leg begins in Hyderabad (October 18 to November 9), then moves on to Noida (November 10 to December 2) and then finishes up in Pune (December 3 to 24), after which the playoffs and the final take place in a venue to be announced later. With two games taking place almost every day, we will witness 137 games of kabaddi over the next three months.\n\nRight, what happened in the auctions?\n\nA major shift away from the veterans - all 12 of the teams have exceeded their New Young Player (NYP) quota, with the likes of Rahul Chaudhari going unsold, and Pardeep Narwhal only fetching \u20b970 lakh. Taking a cue from defending champions Puneri Paltan, who need not have even come to the auction having retained almost all of their championship team thanks to the NYP rule with their academy products, many other franchises have focused on youth.\n\nThat said, large amounts were still spent, with Tamil Thalaivas makings Sachin Tanwar the most expensive signing at \u20b92.15 Cr, closely followed by Guman Singh, who went to the Gujarat Giants for \u20b91.97 Cr. Haryana Steelers, last year's beaten finalists, swooped to sign their Iranian star, Mohammedreza Shadloui Chiyaneh for a whopping \u20b92.07 Cr.\n\nSo, who's going to win?\n\nIt's hard to look beyond last season's finalists. Puneri Paltan may have lost Shadloui, but in captain and league MVP Aslam Inamdar, Mohit Goyat, Akash Shinde, Pankaj Mohite, Abinesh Nadarajan, Gaurav Khatri, Sanket Sawant, Aditya Shinde and new raider Ajith Kumar they have nine starters (from the required seven) already.\n\nThe league's most impressive attacking lineup, that revolutionised the league with having all-round raiders who spread raiding duties amongst themselves and were equally adept in defence, are a well-oiled machine - where Shadloui was an important cog - but one wouldn't put it past the team to overcome his loss. Do so, and Puneri Paltan could become only the second team ever to defend their title and coach BC Ramesh could go on to win his fourth PKL trophy.\n\nHaryana Steelers, who had little answer to Puneri Paltan in last season's final, have shored up what they were best at last season, adding Shadloui to an already impressive defence. With coach Manpreet Singh effectively implementing the footballing equivalent of one-nil-ling his way to victory, the problem for the Steelers remains that 'one'. However, Shadloui could provide a boost in their raiding prowess as well, supporting Vinay and Shivan Patare in attack. Balance could be the key as the Steelers aim to go one better.\n\nAny new forces to keep an eye on?\n\nTamil Thalaivas spent big in the auction and could spring a surprise, especially with the unique concept of Udaya Kumar as head coach and Dharamaraj Cheralathan as a strategy coach. In Sachin, they have a do-or-die raid specialist who could do wonders under Cheralathan as raiding responsibilities get shared with Narender. The only worry is the lack of all-rounders apart from new signing Moeen Safaghi and it places undue pressure on the Iranian in his debut PKL season. The Thalaivas have an impressive, balanced starting lineup, and should they be injury-free, could surprise many and walk away with the title.\n\nBengal Warriorz had the best raiding unit in PKL 10 and the lowest tackle points. They've gone the simple route in solving their problems - retaining Maninder Singh on the attacking side and bringing in Fazel Atrachali in defence. The Iranian is a stellar captain and can guide a youthful defence alongside former UP Yoddhas captain Nitesh Kumar. However, the lack of all-rounders in their squad and few options in depth mean things have to go very right for new coach Prashant Surve to lift the title.\n\nGujarat Giants signed 15 players at the auction, and under the guidance of PKL stalwart Ram Mehar Singh, Guman Singh will lead their raiding outfit. The squad is a bit youthful, and the likes of all-rounder Mohammad Nabibakhsh will be needed to aid a defence that looks a bit thin on paper. However, should their raft of new signings gel well, this could be an outfit that surprises many.\n\nAre Telugu Titans going to be the league's punching again?\n\nThey released Pawan Sehrawat and used the FBM card (Final Bid Match) at the auction to retain him for a lower price, and then added PKL season 8 winning coach, Krishan Kumar Hooda as well as the second-best defender from last season, Krishan Dhull. The Titans were quite active in the auction, with an emphasis on all-rounders and they definitely look on course to avoid a last-place finish for the fourth consecutive season. Should Pawan also receive support in raiding duties, a playoff spot looks likely.\n\nWith Telugu Titans likely to compete well this season, it's hard to predict who will struggle this season, especially given the rest of the league has also assembled balanced squads. Even the likes of Dabang Delhi and Patna Pirates weren't too active in the auction but retained most of their squad. Injuries and squad harmony could be key as the fight for the playoff spots might be the tightest we have witnessed, especially with Jaipur Pink Panthers, U Mumba and UP Yodhhas now boasting of very balanced squads.\n\nAll this talk about youth, what about the league's old guard?\n\nPardeep Narwal is fighting for relevance, and heads to play under the coach who gave him his debut, Randhir Singh Sehrawat with the Bengaluru Bulls. They've also added Ajinkya Pawar and Jai Bhagwan to their raiding lineup, but the team's fortunes all revolve around how the veteran performs. Poor fitness and form saw him have a very middling PKL 10 with the UP Yoddhas, only scoring 122 points. He's claimed to have put in the effort ahead of this season to up his fitness and is aiming for 200 points, but the question marks are ever-present for the veteran.\n\nPawan Sehrawat cannot stat-pad with raiding points alone anymore, as evidenced by him opting to be listed as an all-rounder in the PKL 11 auction. He can be handy in defence, but if the Telugu Titans are going to achieve anything this season, they'll need their superstar to provide in other aspects of the game as well.\n\nThe writing is on the wall for many of the old guard - the league expects more, and as Rahul Chaudhari found out - there's no room for sentiment.\n\nHow will PKL 11 be different?\n\nThe emphasis on young players with a different level of athleticism and professionalism could see tighter contests than before. The league has also recognised that specialist raiders have had their day and are aiming to emulate Puneri Paltan in having raiders shoulder plenty of the defensive burden as well.\n\nWith a league-wide emphasis on defence, and an improvement in general athleticism, we could witness even more impressive feats of ingenuity as raiders fight to score against well drilled defences. It's all set to be a thrilling season of kabaddi.",

    "raw_text": "NEW YORK -- Dick Button was more than the most accomplished men's figure skater in history. He was one of his sport's great innovators and promoters, the man responsible for not only inventing the flying camel spin but also for describing it to generations of fans.\n\nHe was an athlete and actor, a broadcaster and entrepreneur.\n\n\"Dick was one of the most important figures in our sport,\" said Scott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic champion. \"There wasn't a skater after Dick who wasn't helped by him in some way.\"\n\nThe winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world championships, Button died Thursday in North Salem, New York, at age 95. His death was confirmed by his son, Edward, who did not provide a cause, though Button had been in declining health.\n\n\"The two-time Olympic champion's pioneering style and award-winning television commentary revolutionized figure skating,\" U.S. Figure Skating said. \"His legacy will live on forever. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones.\n\nHis death further shook a tight-knight figure skating community already reeling from Wednesday night's crash of an American Airlines flight and an Army helicopter outside Washington, D.C., that killed everyone on board. Two teenage skaters, their mothers and two former world champions who were coaching at the Skating Club of Boston -- where Button also skated and which he remained close to the rest of his life -- were among the 14 people killed from the skating community.\n\nThe trophy room at the Skating Club of Boston is named in Button's honor, and the club has hosted the Dick Button Artistic Figure Skating Showcase, which is designed to promote the beauty and innovation of skating as an artform.\n\nButton's impact on figure skating began after World War II. He was the first U.S. men's champion -- and his country's youngest at the time at age 16 -- when the competition returned in 1946. Two years later, he took gold at the St. Moritz Olympics, back when the competitions were staged outdoors. He performed the first double axel in any competition and became the first American to win the men's event, paving the way for future champions such as Hamilton, Brian Boitano and Nathan Chen.\n\n\"By the way, that jump had a cheat on it,\" Button once said. \"But listen, I did it and that was what counted.\"\n\nThat first Olympic title began his dominance of international skating, and U.S. amateur sports in general. He was the first figure skater to win the prestigious Sullivan Award in 1949 -- no other figure skater won it until Michelle Kwan in 2001.\n\nIn 1952, while still a student at Harvard, Button won a second gold at the Oslo Games, making more history with the first triple jump (a loop) in competition. Soon after, he won a fifth world title, then gave up his eligibility as an amateur to perform in shows; all Olympic sports were subject to an amateur-professional division at the time.\n\n\"I had achieved everything I could have dreamed of doing as a skater,\" said Button, who had earned a law degree from Harvard in 1956. \"I was able to enjoy the Ice Capades and keep my hand in skating, and that was very important to me.\"\n\nWith a frank and often brutally honest style, Button became an Emmy Award-winning TV analyst, helping viewers learn not only the basics but also the nuances of a sport unfamiliar to most casual fans. He became as much a fixture on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" as Jim McKay and the hapless ski jumper that went tumbling down the slope.\n\n\"Dick Button is the custodian of the history of figure skating and its quintessential voice,\" Boitano, the 1988 Olympic champion, said in Button's autobiography. \"He made the words 'lutz' and 'salchow' part of our everyday vocabulary.\"\n\nAfter the 1961 plane crash that killed the entire U.S. figure skating team on the way to the world championships, which then were canceled, Button persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event on \"Wide World.\" That's when he joined the network as a commentator, and took figure skating to a mainstream television audience.\n\nButton later ran professional events that provided skaters an avenue to profit from their ability once their competitive careers were over. The World Professional Figure Skating Championships, the Challenge of Champions and others provided Hamilton, the dance team of Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, Kurt Browning, Katarina Witt and others a new platform to perform.\n\nButton even tried his hand at acting, performing in such shows and films as \"The Young Doctors\" and \"The Bad News Bears Go to Japan.\" His studio, Candid Productions, helped to produce made-for-TV programs such as \"Battle of the Network Stars.\"\n\n\"Dick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits,\" said Johnny Weir, the three-time U.S. champion and current NBC Sports figure skating analyst. \"He told it like it was, even when his opinion wasn't a popular one. His zingers were always in my mind when I would perform for him, and I wanted to make him as happy and proud as I would my coaches.\n\n\"That is something very special about commentating figure skating,\" Weir said. \"As an athlete, we rarely have an opportunity to speak, and we rely on the TV voices to tell our story for us. Nobody could do it like Mr. Button.\"\n\nButton is survived by his longtime partner, Dennis Grimaldi, and his two children, Edward and Emily.",

    "raw_text": "Lakshya Sen's debut Olympics journey came to an end in the most heartbreaking of places - finishing fourth after losing the bronze medal match. This also brought an end to Indian badminton's streak of Olympic medals stretching back to London 2012.\n\nThe 22-year-old Indian went down 21-13, 16-21, 11-21 to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in the bronze medal match, squandering a lead of a game and five points. It was a breakdown under pressure as he visibly unravelled against an opponent on whom he held a positive 4-1 record.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nAfter a path-breaking campaign in Paris, where Lakshya knocked out higher-ranked opponents as an unseeded player and was a win away from a historic medal, to end up with nothing is an unimaginably difficult position to be in.\n\nMake that two losses on consecutive days from advantageous positions after coming so close and it tells of a fundamental problem.\n\nThis isn't the first time he has been let down by his instinct and mentality under the pump. But this also gives him an opportunity to build for the future.\n\nAs eventual gold medallist Viktor Axelsen said after their semifinal, Lakshya has the potential to be a genuine contender for the next Olympics gold -- once he gets enough experience of being in such situations.\n\n\"He has shown in this Olympics that he is a very, very strong competitor and I am sure in four years from now, he will be one of the favourites to win the gold,\" Axelsen. \"Lakshya thought a lot about it. It was a big thing for him obviously, I know what the rings does to your mind.\"\n\nThat pressure is evidently what got to Lakshya.\n\nThe Indian was still processing the result when he spoke right after the match, his eyes almost glazed over as in the final stages of the match against Lee where the pressure of the situation got to him.\n\nOn the face of it, there are very few positives to take home from these two days.\n\nHe had three game points and a lead of 7-0 against the best player in the world. He had the first game and a 5-point advantage against a player he has lost only once to before. He lost both when the enormity of the situation kicked in. In the same spot before, he had raised his game on a court he had spent the most time in. This time, he lost his bearings and made several line misjudgements and unforced errors.\n\nBut there are some positives from the matches before.\n\nHe came out of the group that has third seed Jonatan Christie, he beat compatriot HS Prannoy and won a tough quarterfinal against Chou Tien Chen playing one of the highest quality matches he has in his young career.\n\nHe exhibited the same quality at the start of his next two matches, but he couldn't close out when things mattered, and this will be the thought that will haunt him for a while to come.\n\nWhere does he go from here? How does he look back on his Paris sojourn?\n\nThere is the white, the black and the grey. The ability to be among the best, the absolute collapse under pressure and the grey matter needed to get over that obvious weakness.\n\nFirst, he has to regroup and then comes the introspection and the mental work. Physically, he is at the peak of his game but it's the intangibles of emotions that he has to work on.\n\nLakshya is not a stranger to turning around from rock-bottom confidence. Around this time last year, he went through a rough patch which continued till the start of this years. He lost to virtual unknowns on the national circuit and had seven-straight first-round exits on the BWF Tour. His childhood coach Vimal Kumar said it was a purely mental crisis as he was physically fit. He had to pull himself out of the depths of his confidence crisis.\n\nHe split from his coach Anup Sridhar, got Vimal back on the road, along with mentor Prakash Padukone, and incredibly turned around a corner to qualify for the Olympics in one of the final legs of the Race to Paris. With some help from mental coach Paddy Upton, who famously was with the Indian cricket team during the 2011 World Cup win.\n\nLakshya will have to now go back to that template, perhaps get more sessions with Upton, who is currently with the Indian hockey team in Paris, and form scar tissue over the very fresh wound.\n\nBadminton is a sport that happens week in and week out, which gives him plenty of time to get in the match time and recover from this. Lakshya has never lacked talent but it's the temperament that is missing. And that will only come in with more consistency on the BWF Tour.\n\nHe needs to put himself in big finals again, and win them. He has plenty of big wins - over almost every top player - in his short career but it's the titles he should target next. The Commonwealth gold and India Open as a Super 500 can't be his biggest wins as he goes into the next Olympic cycle.\n\nIf he can do that, then with his potential and physicality, he can fulfil two-time reigning Olympic champion Axelsen's prophecy and be one to watch out for at Los Angeles 2028.",

    "raw_text": "If I promise to only do it once, then perhaps you'll pardon me stealing a song line from the Sound of Music to ask: \"How Do You Solve A Problem Like Ronald Ara\u00fajo?\" Because anyone who thought Barcelona put their difficulties with the Uruguay international to bed after the announcement that the defender had renewed his contract until 2031 needs to wake up and smell the coffee.\n\nAra\u00fajo wasn't dropped for the weekend's 7-1 thrashing of Valencia to rest or protect him for the tough test against Atalanta on Wednesday: he was dropped for two key reasons.\n\nFirstly, even ahead of some comical decisions by Wojciech Szczesny while Bar\u00e7a were winning 5-4 at Benfica in the Champions League last week, Ara\u00fajo was by far the No. 1 reason for his team looking ludicrously easy to breach. He broke the offside line (badly and repeatedly), his passing out of defence was either risk-averse or easily pressed, his positional choices were often downright wrong, and he scored a silly own goal. Benfica were looking at him like wolves regard sheep: voraciously.\n\nThe second reason needs to be understood in light of how fast Barcelona acted in order to renew the 25-year-old's contract, specifically because his decision to join Juventus in this transfer market was the second time in two seasons he's flirted very openly with a big European rival. (Bayern Munich was last year.) But with I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez injured and a run of crucial games ahead, the strength of Juve's intention to move for him galvanised Bar\u00e7a into ensuring he didn't insist on an exit.\n\nThey were probably right in that logic: fine. But once the club business was done, team manager Hansi Flick immediately reminded Ara\u00fajo not to imagine that a renewed contract automatically meant he was occupying what business negotiators call the \"power seat.\" It was a shot across the bow to say: \"We want to keep you, you've parlayed up Juve's interest into a better contract and the club's board moved with electric speed to retain you, but don't imagine that means you're the boss around here. Don't think you're my only option ... don't imagine you can coast!\"\n\nIt was a sound idea from the German coach, a reminder that Flick isn't satisfied with the centre-back's playing level, decision-making or concentration level.\n\nAra\u00fajo comes from a football-obsessed family where both grandmothers and his mum dedicatedly played organized soccer in Brazil and Uruguay. He's lived and breathed competitive sport from the moment he could walk until today, with Barcelona, Bayern and Juventus spending much of the past 12 months squabbling over him.\n\nThe trouble with Ara\u00fajo is that although he is a genuine \"strength\" in his club's arsenal, it's one of those \"pound for pound\" strengths -- the kind of adjective that comes with an asterisk attached. He's a terrific athlete; he's extremely competitive; his aerial ability is more a product of his leap than his height; he's a ferocious tackler, quick and, given that he was a striker as a kid, he's even a useful threat up at the attacking end of the pitch.\n\nBut technique has never quite been his thing. Neither his first touch nor his ability to pass under pressure, in the Barcelona \"playing out from the back\" ideology have been positive elements in his scouting report.\n\nIn the fly-on-the-wall documentary I executive-produced during Luis Enrique's first season in charge of Paris Saint-Germain, the Spanish coach shared his tactical preparation for what would become his side's 4-1 demolition of Barcelona at Montjuic in last season's Champions League quarterfinal. Luis Enrique told us: \"There's no doubt. 'If we press them [Bar\u00e7a], they'll kick it long. Down the right, we let Ara\u00fajo come out with the ball. Whenever he does that we isolate him, and we press him.\"\n\nThen, in the prematch tactical video session, he told the PSG players: \"This gentleman is Ara\u00fajo. A top-level footballer, no question, but the Bar\u00e7a player with the most problems. Every time the ball goes towards him, we must already be closing off his passing line and then pressing him.\"\n\nInevitably, as you've by now guessed, Paris follow their coach's instructions, Bradley Barcola presses Ara\u00fajo, the defender kicks possession away and as PSG erupt into an immediate counter-attack Barcola is fed the ball only for the Uruguayan to commit a \"last-man\" foul and get sent off. From leading 4-2 on aggregate, that was game over for Barcelona, and they're duly knocked out of the competition, 4-1 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate.\n\nWhat last week in Lisbon showed is that things have got even tougher for Ara\u00fajo now that Flick is in charge. Their high-risk, occasionally high-reward, very advanced defensive line (on average their back four are 50 metres from their own goal-line) needs to be applied impeccably. None of the defenders nor the keeper can make a mistake, and split-second drop-offs in concentration can cost you a goal, a penalty, a red card or, indeed, calamitous defeat.\n\nSome sympathy is owed to the big, wholehearted 25-year-old because the demands placed by Flick also scared the living daylights out of Ara\u00fajo's teammates (while he was injured) when the new German coach first announced them on the club's U.S. tour last summer. But they all had time to learn, practice and assimilate the huge new challenges. Meanwhile, Ara\u00fajo was undergoing a long rehab process and fighting back to fitness.\n\nIt turns out Ara\u00fajo isn't a guy who can watch, understand and then apply the hugely complicated system without lots of practical, \"in-game\" trial-and-error. His errors came against Benfica when the poor kid looked bewildered, overwhelmed and struggling to make sense of the mayhem around him.\n\nThe last time I interviewed Ara\u00fajo, long before this offside-trap system was Barcelona's modus operandi, he explained his general outlook.\n\n\"Barcelona has a very different philosophy from everyone else,\" he said. \"Even when I managed to understand, it was like the ball was coming at me at almost 200 km/h! \"I tried to control it ... I'd fail and I'd go home feeling frustrated and thinking 'I don't deserve to be here if I'm not able to control the ball!' But I'd tell myself 'What I need to do is learn!'\"\n\nAra\u00fajo did learn, the balance of his importance and worth tilted in his favour, and temporarily he even became a special weapon in El Cl\u00e1sico, man-marking Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior before, in due course, becoming part of Barcelona's five-man captaincy group.\n\nRight now, while Ara\u00fajo is being drilled on the basics by the coaching staff and studies video tapes long into the night, he will have to accept that Flick will often choose the Pau Cubars\u00ed-Mart\u00ednez partnership ahead of him, he'll occasionally have to accept deputising for Jules Kound\u00e9 at right-back, and he's got to get used to feeling like a novice again -- something that might well be tested by Atalanta's terrifically clever, non-stop pass-and-move style in the Champions League on Wednesday.",

    "raw_text": "This is one of four cover stories for ESPN The Magazine's June 8 World Fame issue. Subscribe today!\n\nIt is easy to find the most private superstar in the world.\n\nSeriously, it is. You just put Hogar de Messi -- hogar is Spanish for \"home\" -- into Google Maps, and up pops an address in Castelldefels, a gorgeous, windswept village carved into a mountain on the outskirts of Barcelona. Occasionally, the listing disappears for a spell (such is the Internet), but it always returns, and there are even \"reviews\" of Lionel Messi's place available from other Google users to help prepare you for your visit: One offers a five-star rating and the helpful description Aqui vive Dios. God lives here.\n\nNow, if it seems unusual that walking up to the house of a five-time Ballon d'Or winner is about as easy as finding a diner, that's because it is. Plenty of global icons awash in fame live in elaborate compounds built on swanky islands (Tiger Woods) or in villas constructed on privately owned roads with U.N.-level security gates (Cristiano Ronaldo). Messi's home, though, is on a regular street.\n\nThe avenue has withered trees, a crumbling sidewalk or two and a Continental feel. There are uneven curbs and cars parked at unusual angles. Occasionally, the postman mixes up whose mail goes in which box and one of Messi's neighbors accidentally gets an electric bill that runs about $1,200 per month.\n\nStanding at the house, even behind the typical European fence, you can crane your neck to see the miniature soccer field Messi installed, complete with floodlights, for his kids. You can see the balcony looking over the Mediterranean. You can see the light smoke wafting from the tapered chimney.\n\nYou can see the driveway and the pool and the balconies, if you want. You can hear the occasional woofs of Messi's dog, Hulk, a gigantic French mastiff. You can be so close that it's possible, just for a second, to believe that the figure up the street -- the one with a ball cap pulled low and the purposeful saunter and the leash in his hand -- is Messi himself.\n\nIt isn't, you know. It never is. The sheer geography of Messi's home allows for a sense of intimacy, a sense of familiarity maybe. But it is an illusion: Even around here, Messi is a ghost.\n\nLeBron James once bought cupcakes for his entire neighborhood in Ohio as a way to apologize for the TV trucks and fans that clotted the area, but Messi -- while unfailingly pleasant on the rare moments he appears -- is known only for waving back at those who live here. Messi never waves first.\n\nIn some ways, that fits with the paradox that is the concrete slab on which Messi's greatness is built. He does not run like a gazelle, does not jump as if on springs, does not possess the brute strength or power of a colossus. At 5-foot-7 and (maybe) 150 pounds, with shoulders that look to be made of papier-mache, Messi could disappear behind a door frame if he wanted. His old nickname, La Pulga, or The Flea, is generous.\n\nYet despite that, he dribbles through entire teams. He whips in shots that crackle like a summer storm. He dazzles so totally and consistently that he has created a career routinely described as \"the best there ever was.\" So given that particular brand of wizardry, it shouldn't be surprising that Messi has conjured a way to live among the people and still hide in plain sight.\n\nThe real question is: Does Messi's reclusion matter?\n\nThis is Messi's choice, understand, his personal methodology. Most legendary sports figures wrap us in a multisensory experience, a litany of things we can see -- dunks, goals, shots, runs or throws -- but also a cacophony of sounds, an audio uniquely theirs.\n\nMuhammad Ali spun poetry and stung like a bee. Michael Jordan trash-talked and hit nothing but net. LeBron said he'll never shut up and dribble, then shot buzzer-beating daggers. And it's not as if Messi is following some football code of silence either. Ronaldo suggested the reason people hate him is that he's just too good, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic compared himself to, among other things, a great white shark, Benjamin Button and Jesus Christ.\n\nAll of them crafted personalities and, in most cases, messages they were interested in conveying. They spoke to us.\n\nMessi, whose global presence rivals any athlete's, does not. His soundtrack, such as it is, comes from a mixture of screams and shouts, gasps and gulps, all of which emanate not from him but rather from the millions upon millions who are mesmerized by the sweet magic pouring from his feet like cake batter.\n\nThis is how Messi has chosen to confront his fame.\n\nHe is the quietest superstar.\n\nLionel Messi is standing on a box. A few feet in front of him, a photographer lies on the ground, camera pointing upward. Behind the photographer, a man tosses a soccer ball toward Messi, who leaps off the box and taps the ball with his foot, legs extended as though he is ripping a shot into the net.\n\nIt is a beautiful cover shot for this magazine -- or at least it would be, except it is all wrong. The tosses are too high or too low. Messi is not timing his leap correctly. When he does leap, he extends the wrong foot. The pictures do not look right, and everyone is uneasy about how long Messi and his handlers will allow it all to go on.\n\nThis sort of tension is not unusual during the few days Messi does commercials or sits for interviews. Being the quietest superstar may seem like a simple endeavor, but it is not only about a low volume or a lack of quotes; it is a state of mind for Messi, an overarching approach to, well, pretty much everything that does not somehow connect to soccer, his family or his close circle of friends. Also, Messi does not hide his feelings about such extraneous concerns; in these moments, the unease slathered across his face is thicker than his beard.\n\nBecause of Messi's general disinterest in all business matters, as well as his demanding schedule with Barcelona and Argentina (through May 14, Messi had scored 34 goals in 35 La Liga games this season), his advisers generally try to schedule no more than one morning a month with time dedicated to promotion or media. During one such day in March, I ask a person close to Messi if this type of scheduling is effective for a player in such demand. \"It is the only way he will do it,\" the person says through a tight smile.\n\nThis morning has been tricky. Adidas has taken over a small stadium just outside Barcelona to work with its biggest client, and the setup is elaborate: tents, lights, wardrobe, makeup, the works. Hours before Messi jumps on that box -- hours before he even arrives -- lighting techs linger over Iberico ham at the breakfast table while men carrying cameras of varying sizes shimmy past security guards both real and fake. (One of the spots being filmed apparently involves a police chase.)\n\nThe mood is relaxed enough until Messi lands on-site; then the pressure ratchets up. Everything is catered to make this easy for Messi -- there is a tent of his own to relax in and even a body double (really more of a freaky doppelganger) who has the same shaggy facial hair and ornate tattoos as Messi, bouncing around to help stage shots before the actual Messi steps in for filming. Yet everyone knows that Messi's tolerance is short. He is never rude to the producers or directors or camera people or crew; he is, by all accounts, polite and well-mannered. He is just ... distant, half-listening to what is said around him but rarely speaking himself.\n\nIn an attempt to streamline the process, the photographer has set up a large piece of cardboard covered with photos. This is to allow Messi to see clearly the poses and images that the crew hopes to get from him. Thanks to Messi's body double and a lengthy session a day earlier, Messi can literally look at (a version of) himself and just copy what he sees.\n\nMessi glances at the cardboard. Two stylists spend roughly 20 seconds adjusting the drape of his jersey. Then he gestures to his body double, who twice expertly jumps from the box. Messi nods and steps onto the box.\n\nNone of the first few attempts is even close to what the shot requires. Messi looks twisted, and his jumps are disjointed. He is not kicking back with his trail leg at all, so he resembles a stiff flamingo. This is bad.\n\n\"No problem, let's try it again,\" the photographer says kindly from the floor, but the results do not improve. The photographer starts sweating. Messi begins to look exasperated. He has been in this makeshift studio beneath the grandstand for less than three minutes, but even the body double looks nervous.\n\nMessi kicks another one wrong. Then a toss goes awry. The photographer's voice is a little sharper as he talks to Messi's adviser now. No one wants a flamingo on this cover.\n\nStanding on the box, Messi pauses for a moment, as if he has just noticed the mood around him. Then he lifts his head at the thrower and, when the ball is in the air, leaps out -- still doing it wrong -- and taps the ball with his foot so that it arcs gracefully in a smooth parabola and lands near the prone photographer's groin. The photographer recoils (understandably). Everyone else laughs (understandably). Messi's face is blank.\n\nWas it an accident? A purposeful icebreaker? An indication of Messi's feelings about this entire circumstance? Here is what I know about Messi's control of a soccer ball: He routinely shoots one into the top corner of a goal from 20 yards away without much trouble.\n\nAlso, two tosses later, Messi nails the picture out of nowhere, his leg kicking back like a thoroughbred. Then he nails it again. There is a cheer from those assembled.\n\nThe photographer quickly moves on to a few portraits. The stylists add a warm-up jacket, the photographer takes a few more portraits and suddenly Messi is leaving. He shakes hands with the photographer, nods to the others and walks out the door without looking back. The body double (and everyone else) exhales. Messi's entourage disappears into the hall.\n\nIt is over. Messi was on set for eight minutes.\n\nLest there be any confusion, it must be said: He does talk sometimes.\n\nNot a lot, certainly. Messi doesn't do news conferences before games like most other big-name players, doesn't often stop in mixed zones afterward. He doesn't even speak in most of his commercials.\n\nInterviews with unfamiliar reporters or outlets too are rare. For this story, Messi initially agreed to a face-to-face conversation but called it off a few weeks later, without explanation, sending word that he would answer questions only if they were emailed to an associate. (Even then, he answered only certain questions, and several of the ones sent were simply ignored.) Messi and I did meet, very briefly, shaking hands the day of the photo shoot: I said \"Hello.\" He replied \"Gracias.\" It was lovely.\n\nStill, there are moments. As he has gotten older (he'll turn 31 during the World Cup), Messi has put himself in certain situations in which he cracks the door.\n\nEarlier this year, he spent nearly half an hour being interviewed for an Argentine television show and speaking at length, for him, on subjects that ranged from his children (he loves them) to how a diet filled with chocolate and carbonated beverages led to frequent bouts of on-field vomiting earlier in his career (he eats healthier now).\n\nMessi also gave his take on the feeling that this summer will be his final chance to claim the biggest prize that has eluded him -- a World Cup title -- and make amends for the four major final defeats he has been part of with Argentina (he would like this to happen).\n\nSometimes he even gets remarkably candid. For example, last year he appeared on a Uruguayan television show with his close friend and Barca teammate Luis Suarez, the star of Uruguay's national team. For much of the interview, Messi was happy to be something of a sidekick, but he became more animated while participating in a discussion on the age-old question of whether it is preferable for men to sit or stand while urinating (he sits). When the host of the show expressed surprise and concern about the men soaking the toilet seat (Suarez said he pees sitting down as well), Messi calmly explained, \"You just point it down,\" while making a helpful hand gesture.\n\nSo clearly, he does speak (even about the most personal of subjects). He concedes, in the email, that \"over the years you become less timid. I now do things I never imagined I would.\"\n\nBut then, speaking isn't the same thing as having a voice, is it?\n\n\u0093Today, everyone wants to see things in the way that suits them. I prefer not to play this game.\u0094\n\n- Lionel Messi\n\nAmong Messi's true contemporaries -- those whose fame crosses continents and cultures instead of just cities or countries -- many, if not most, choose to say something, to do something, to show something that is greater than the sum of their physical accomplishments. I don't mean philanthropy (Messi, like many athletes, invests time and money in a variety of genuinely admirable ways), but rather an engagement with the considerable platform that his preternatural ability has provided.\n\nAli used his fame to advocate for civil rights and protest the Vietnam War. The U.N. made Pele an ambassador for ecology and the environment. LeBron James has seized upon social justice. Messi, while seemingly doing plenty of good with his charitable foundation and his relationship with UNICEF, appears to have little interest in connecting on anything greater. Perhaps a Messi-themed amusement park, to open in China in 2020, will provide enough of his illusory presence to satisfy his ravenous fans. As Messi said at its introductory announcement: \"Hopefully, they will feel that I am around when visiting the park.\"\n\nThose in Spain know that proximity does not equal openness. After nearly 20 years living in Barcelona, Messi is almost never heard speaking in Catalan (it qualified as stunning news when he posted a video on social media showing his son singing a Catalan nursery rhyme), and he has never said anything substantive about Catalan independence -- by far the biggest issue facing his adopted home. How much does Messi want to avoid the subject? When I asked him directly about his opinion via email, he -- or his people -- just deleted the question.\n\nIt is the same with Argentina. Messi has pointedly chosen not to offer support for any particular changes he wants to see in the country -- which has struggled to combat poverty and crime -- nor has he told his legions of followers what he believes needs to be done to revitalize his homeland.\n\nThis is his pattern. On issues of substance, Messi is a monster's shadow: easy to see but impossible to hear. Yet despite his personal restraint, it is clear that, one way or another, regular people still feel a kinship with Messi, even in the absence of anything other than his sheer excellence.\n\nGiven, then, what Messi means to the most popular sport in the world, is his silence novel? Delightful? A throwback to a simpler time? Or is it an abdication?\n\n\"Nobody is going to say he is not a good player -- it's about a lack of identity,\" says Cecilia Guardati, an Argentine journalist who covered Messi when he moved to Barcelona. \"The Argentinian character -- Messi doesn't have it. He does not have a strong personality like Diego Maradona.\"\n\nShe pauses, then says, \"With Maradona, you can hate him and what he says, but everyone likes that he shouts. Messi never, ever shouts.\"\n\nThe Maradona comparison is one Messi cannot shake, but it is also complicated; the two men are so different despite both being Argentines and inarguably among the greatest soccer players ever. Unlike Messi, Maradona is the quintessential Argentine: brash, brilliant and occasionally belligerent, a combination that overshadows the fact that he is also a womanizer and has battled drug addiction. Of course, he did lead Argentina to a World Cup title in 1986, while Messi has lost one World Cup final and three Copa America finals.\n\nMore important, Maradona embraced his role as a likable, if overly animated, villain, an erratically enigmatic legend who was entertaining even if he was absurd. Messi, by contrast, seems to have no particular interest in being either hero or villain, preferring simply to exist as a looping highlight video -- remarkable but with no particular context.\n\nAsked about this approach over email, Messi said, according to his PR team, that \"today, there are people with a lot of interests and everyone wants to see things in the way that suits them. I prefer not to play this game.\" The chosen trope, repeated often by those around Messi, is that soccer is the way Messi likes to express himself. And sure, fine, fair enough. Maybe there is some charm in that. Maybe there is sincerity that someone who is so skilled that on multiple occasions police have busted drug traffickers and seized bricks of cocaine that the dealers named after him (because, naturally, it was the best) wants to limit himself to sport and nothing more.\n\nMaybe there is some simplicity in wanting to go through public life engaging only with that which is beautiful. But is that admirable? Or is it just weak?\n\nAt a minimum, we can say this: It isn't an act. Those who knew Messi as a boy in Argentina say he has been reticent since childhood, that he was, in so many words, a quiet runt. They say that he was so innocent that all an old coach had to do to inspire him was offer an alfajor, or Argentine cookie, in exchange for each goal. (For goals scored with his head, Messi received two cookies, and to maximize his treats, he once famously dribbled through the entire opposing team, flicked the ball up in the air as he neared the goal line and headed it in.)\n\nIn Barcelona, it is the same. Messi's first coach at Barcelona's youth academy, Xavier Llorens, says he knew right away that Messi was special because of the way the ball stuck to his foot when he ran -- almost as if it was connected to his shoelaces -- but also, he adds, \"he was special because of his shyness.\" In the dressing room, sometimes the coaches and players had to double-check that Messi was even there.\n\nMessi did his first significant television interview in November 2003 at age 16, shortly after earning a professional contract following a season in which he scored 36 goals for his youth team. The video is remarkable if only because Messi's center-part hairstyle and clear discomfort sitting across a desk from the Barca TV personality make it difficult to look away. At one point, Messi admits, \"I am more nervous here than on the pitch,\" explaining that \"when I get on the pitch I can forget everything, and that's where I do my talking.\"\n\nYears later, it remains his approach. When Messi returned to the national team last summer following his short-lived retirement, he did not do a lengthy news conference or teary sit-down. He released a short statement explaining that he still loved playing for his nation, then went out and scored a hat trick in a crucial World Cup qualifier that sent Argentina on its way to a place in Russia. It was pure Messi: Everyone knew how he felt; he didn't need to say it.\n\nIt is the same on social media. Messi has 89 million Facebook followers and 91 million on Instagram, and no plans to start a Twitter account any time soon. According to a person close to him, that is largely because he is more comfortable with images: photos of him walking with his teammates or training on the field or playing with his three sons or lounging with his wife or cuddling with Hulk. Twitter is for words; Messi prefers art.\n\nHis neighbors in Castelldefels know. They might prefer it otherwise (who wouldn't like a garrulous millionaire living next door?), but they get it. The joke in the neighborhood is that the only thing anyone ever hears from Messi is him revving his car, because his Range Rover has the sort of gritty, guttural, souped-up engine noise that can wake babies sleeping in Madrid. Sometimes those vrooms are the only sign of Messi for weeks.\n\nOne day a few years back, a neighbor tells me, a group of Ukrainian soccer fans who had just arrived in Spain decide to come to Castelldefels like pilgrims, seeking to pay homage to their beloved Messi. They bring a Ukrainian national team jersey they want to give to Messi as a gift, and they set up on the sidewalk outside his house, waiting for even a sliver of a moment when they can deliver their offering.\n\nHours pass. One, two, three. The neighbor inquires how long they might stay, and the men reply that they are determined to give Messi their country's jersey. Four, five, six hours go by, and the neighbor inquires once more. We must give him our jersey, he is told again. The neighbor nods and goes on his way.\n\nThe next day, the neighbor says, he receives a knock on his door. It is his gardener. The Ukrainian fans finally left after 10 hours of waiting the night before, the gardener tells him, but not before corralling the gardener and, in a last-ditch attempt to have their gift delivered, asking if he -- that is, Messi's neighbor's gardener -- might pass along the jersey to Messi on their behalf.\n\n\"So I ask the gardener, 'Did you give it to him?'\" the neighbor says. \"But I am laughing. And he is laughing. Because there would be a better chance if they just threw it over the fence.\"\n\nThe neighbor shrugs then, because he knows what everyone around here has come to realize: that no one -- not those who find Messi on Google Maps, not even those who live across the street from the place where Messi sleeps at night -- is really his neighbor. None of us. We are only his audience, his viewers, his onlookers, a crowd of millions stationed outside his cocoon, lingering as near as we can so that we might catch a glimpse of his elegance during those times he chooses to fly.\n\nFor many, that is enough. Those Ukrainian fans, bless them, just wanted to be close, just wanted to say they spent a day where the best lives, even if they really only met the guy who gardens for the guy who lives next door. They just wanted to extend their hands and feel the warmth from Messi's glow.\n\nDo we expect more than that from our superstars? Or should we? It isn't as though Messi doesn't give us anything, you know. When he plays and the ball settles at his feet, he allows us to imagine with abandon, allows us to dream with our eyes open.\n\nBut we also know that once the ball rolls to the side, he will vanish. We know there will be no memorable advertising campaigns or political endorsements or social commentary or calls to action from Messi, know that he will not lead us anywhere other than toward the goal. With Messi, we will get only these instants. These moments. These flashes.\n\nAnd it is enough because it has to be. Because Messi does not worry if we want more or need more than that from him, because Messi does not worry at all.\n\nFor the quietest superstar, the game is all that has ever mattered. The rest is just noise.\n\nPere Bosch contributed reporting.\n\nSam BordenBorden is a senior writer for ESPN. He previously worked for The New York Times as a foreign correspondent based in Paris.",

    "raw_text": "WAYNE DREHS spent months reporting his profile of Michael Phelps, as the swimmer prepares for his last Olympics. In this story behind the story, he talks about a turning point in that process.\n\nFrom the very beginning of Michael Phelps' comeback -- long before the DUI or the 45 days of alcohol rehab at The Meadows -- I desperately wanted to better understand the man behind the 18 gold medals. I had interviewed Phelps countless times before but hadn't once felt that I had come close to knowing him. There always seemed to be so much more there, tucked behind a fiercely protected wall. In most interviews he was moody and clich\u00e9d, with little to say. On the rare occasions you would speak to him one-on-one, he didn't want to be there and said little of substance, and everyone left the room feeling as if they had wasted their time. Except perhaps the corporate sponsor Phelps was there to promote.\n\nWe all knew what Phelps had accomplished in the water. We had all seen him trying to sell us $5 footlongs, but what did we really know about him? Who was Phelps the person? I needed access to Phelps' thoughts, feelings and emotions -- not just his presence. In the fall of 2014, I felt I was making headway. And then Phelps was arrested for DUI -- he ended up pleading guilty and got probation -- and went to The Meadows for those 45 days.\n\nFor the purposes of getting Phelps to open up, it was probably one of the best things that could have happened. Now Phelps needed the media to share his story. And the challenge became less about access and more about filtering what was real from what might be spin.\n\nDuring the span of eight months, I interviewed Phelps in six states. We ate lunch and dinner together. And each time we met, he began to reveal more and more about his struggles out of the water. He talked about his dad. His fights with coach Bob Bowman. His often polarizing personality during practice. \"I can be quite a d---,\" he admitted.\n\nI also sat down for lengthy in-person interviews with his mother, father and girlfriend. I talked to coaches, swimmers and others around the sport who knew Phelps well. Bowman and I talked for more than seven hours. At one point, I asked Bowman why anyone should believe that, unlike London, this wasn't another PR job. \"Because you're here,\" Bowman told me. \"There's nothing to hide anymore. We talk about Fred. We talk about the fights. We talk about Michael ditching practice. It's all out there now. There are no more secrets.\"\n\nOnly Bowman and Phelps knows if that's really the truth. I can tell you there wasn't a single question I asked that he refused to answer or brushed aside. He was always open and revealing.\n\nThroughout my reporting of this piece, friends and family would ask me one question more than any other: Had Michael Phelps really changed? I told them all the same simple story. After the second day of a meet in January in Austin, Texas, the swimming complex had all but emptied when Phelps started to make his way toward the exit. Before his hand pushed open the door, he stopped, turned around and found a USA Swimming PR representative. \"Do you need me for anything tonight?\" he asked. \"Does anybody want to talk to me?\" I just stood there and shook my head, because four years ago that would have been unfathomable for Phelps. Instead, he would have secretly tried to slip out a back door rather than talk to reporters. Now he was making sure nobody needed anything from him.\n\nPhelps and I left together that night, and as we walked into the Austin darkness we made plans to meet in Arizona the following week. I told him how bizarre it was that he was now asking if reporters needed anything else from him. He looked at me and shrugged. We kept walking. I mentioned something about my daughters; I don't even remember what it was. He smiled and said how excited he was to become a father (his first child, a son, was born in May). And then, before we parted ways, he turned around and asked me a question: \"What do you like best about being a dad?\" I didn't even know what to say. Not only was Phelps now answering probing, personal questions; he was asking them, too.",

India will once again play Japan on Tuesday for a place in the final.\n\nThe match started on an expected not with India dominating the possession and being the aggressive side in the first quarter. Despite being good on the ball, they failed to score past their opponents.\n\nJapanese goalkeeper Yu Kudo deserves a lot of credit for keeping the scoreline 0-0 as she kept pulling off saves. In the second quarter, Kudo came up with three back-to-back saves to stop India from taking a lead.\n\nLike they did against China, India turned the game around after the half-time break. After winning a free hit just outside the circle, Navneet collected the ball from Lalremsiami, entered the circle and produced a solid reverse hit to beat Kudo as India took a deserving lead in the match.\n\nIn the final quarter, India earned a few penalty corners and despite missing the chances, Deepika managed to score twice in the 47th and 48th minute. Both her dragflicks had power behind the ball as Japan's hopes were crushed with quickfire goals.\n\nIn the other semifinal on Tuesday, China, who finished second on the table, will take on Malaysia finished third ahead of Japan.

Bengal Tigers are leading the table with 18 points, followed by Toofans who also have 18 points but with lesser outright wins. Their last match draw against Gonasika earned them a point which confirmed their place in the semifinal.\n\nHowever, the top three sports are not confirmed with Bengal Tigers, Soorma, and the Dragons in contention to finish at the top.\n\nWhich teams have been eliminated?\n\nVedanta Kalinga Lancers, Team Gonasika, and Delhi SG Pipers have no chances to make it to the semifinals.

In this case, the next match between Dragons and Rudras becomes a must-win for Rudras while Dragons will need only a draw to go through.\n\nIf Soorma suffers an outright loss, their semifinal hopes will hinge on Dragons beating Rudras or the latter not earning a shootout bonus after a draw.\n\nIf Rudras secure an outright win over Dragons after Soorma's loss then then goal difference will come into play to determine who will go through between Soorma and Dragons since both teams would've won four matches each.\n\nIf teams are level on points then outright wins will be counted for qualification to the semifinal, followed by the goal difference, followed by the number of field goals scored followed results in the league phase between the two concerned teams.",

    "raw_text": "M Sudhakar, 21, took a vow in 2019 to not watch the Pro Kabaddi League [PKL] if he was not playing in it. Cut to 2023, he was in the stadium for a PKL game for the first time in four years. This time he was not in the audience, he was on the mat for PKL's most successful team, Patna Pirates.\n\nSudhakar hails from the kabaddi-loving village of Palayanallur near Trichy in Tamil Nadu -- his father, four elder brothers, cousins all played the sport in Palayanallur. It was only obvious that he took to the sport as a child. But he wasn't allowed to travel for tournaments since he was the youngest boy in the house. That was until a day in 11th standard that he recalls as a \"life-changing one.\"\n\n\"There was a game in a neighbouring village and all the senior players left the night before. Two members of the team were going in the morning to give them their ID cards and asked me to tag along. I happily went and my elder brother, Sangeeth, scolded me for coming. But as luck would have it, one of their players did not make the weight limit and I was asked to join. I scored four points and won the game. That was the day that changed it all,\" he tells ESPN.\n\nThat sparked the light in his kabaddi career and Sudhakar took off. He would often train by himself in the muddy fields early in the morning to perfect his skills, and it paid off at the 2022 winter edition of the Yuva Kabaddi Series. It's a platform that works as a feeder system for the PKL and Sudhakar was the season's best raider with 320 raid points. That saw PKL clubs flood his phone and it was the three-time champions Patna Pirates who won his signature.\n\nLife in the PKL has been a fun ride for Sudhakar -- it's the first time he has boarded so many flights, visited so many cities and shared the training mat with India's best kabaddi players such as Sachin Tanwar.\n\nBut there's more to it: playing in the PKL is also a means to earn his family pride. His father, Maruthamuthu, works as a daily wage labourer and has been at the receiving end of taunts. He was told that his sons urupuda matanga [would amount to nothing] and that they would also follow suit in lifting sacks.\n\n\"I used to feel annoyed, ennaku apadiye uruthum [I would be hurting]. He once carried sacks to my school when I was in 8th standard and it really hurt me. I felt bad looking at how much he used to struggle. He used to lift sacks that weighed 90kgs sacks despite one of his hands being partially paralyzed.\"\n\nHis father makes around Rs 800 a day. Sudhakar current contract is worth Rs 8 lakh for the season.\n\nBut since his arrival in the PKL, the narrative around the village has changed. People speak proudly of him and congratulate his father for raising a sportsperson. \"Now they all say that it's so nice to see me play at such a big level. The other day my mother called and said \"nalla peru vaangi kuduthute [you've earned us a good name]. They are all very happy. My father does not show it, but my mother told me he comes home and excitedly tells her about how people speak about me nowadays.\"\n\nSudhakar is at peace seeing his family happy. But on the mat, he still has a point to prove.\n\n\"I have not shown all my skills yet. I can do a lot more -- I can grab a bonus point and get touch while being airborne on the way back. I have a really good jump. I can multi-point raids. As I get to play more matches, I will show everyone what I am capable of.\"\n\nSudhakar has played in 11 of Patna Pirates' 12 matches this season and has 67 points to his name. His friends back in Palayanallur already refer to him as a 'PKL star'. He is, after all, the first in their village to play at such a top level. But Sudhakar wants a lot more -- to become like his idols: Pardeep Narwal and Ajay Thakur.",

    "raw_text": "It's half past seven on a bitterly cold Monday evening in Jaipur. Hundreds of people, wrapped up in their puffiest jackets and snuggest beanies, make a beeline along the periphery of the iconic Sawai Mansingh Stadium. And in true Jaipur style, the entire area is lit with pink bulbs - this is the 'Pink City' after all.\n\nAmong the crowd are the kabaddi fanatics, animatedly discussing how the teams could shape up today. Then there are families with kids in tow, out to make the most of a public holiday. And some of the attendees just happened to be there by chance and had no idea of the occasion: the 1000th game of the Pro Kabaddi League.\n\nGillian and Bethany, an English mother-daughter duo travelling through India, learnt about the game after seeing a hoarding on their way into the city from the airport. \"We initially thought it was a football match, but then we looked it up and it looked somewhat like rugby, and we thought why not go watch it,\" says Gillian, while fixing the pink Jaipur Pink Panthers (JPP) cap she just bought. It was their first time attending a kabaddi game and it so happened to be a landmark day. As Bethany put it, \"Guess we couldn't have come on a better day!\"\n\nAt the other end of the fan spectrum is Omesh Maharshi. \"I have been watching [PKL, and JPP] since 2014,\" he says. \"I was in the stadium [back] then and I am here today. I was here when [the Pink Panthers] won the title and even went to the hotel to celebrate with the team. I diligently follow all the games.\"\n\nAt one of the other entry gates, beside a huge installation of the iconic Hawa Mahal, are a bunch of young boys going \"live\" from their social media accounts. They were among the lucky ones to score tickets for the game and did not want their friends at home to feel left out.\n\nWithin the icy confines of the stadium, meanwhile, were two friends battling out on the mat in that 1000th match: Bengal Warriors captain Maninder Singh and Bengaluru Bulls' powerhouse Ran Singh. Maninder has credited Ran for making him the player he is...and it was rather amusing that Maninder's first point of the game came off his mentor.\n\nManinder is the only raider who played in the first season of PKL to also be playing now, and it was only fitting that he finished on the winning side in the 1000th game. And watching from the sidelines were five legends of the game - Anup Kumar, Ajay Thakur, Dharmraj Cheralathan, Manjeet Chhilar and Rishank Devadiga - who were felicitated with a gold coin before the game.\n\nThe stadium DJ warmed up the capacity crowd with a few bass-thumping songs, including the uber popular 'Ishq tera tadpave [Oh ho ho ho]' track by Sukhbir. The fans were in for a mini dance party, including the three Swedish tourists - Aino, Sam, and Jackie - who happened to see a kabaddi team in their hotel, googled the sport and headed to the stadium.\n\nAhead of the second match, the decibel levels went through the roof as the Pink Panthers, the sons of the soil, made their entrance. Their match against U Mumba was symbolic in many ways - the first-ever PKL game on July 26, 2014, was between these two teams. The same two teams played the first-ever PKL final on August 31, 2014.\n\nAs fate [or scheduling] would have it, it was these two teams that fought it out in the 1001st PKL game, marking the start of a new era... an era that was ushered in by a triumph for the Pink Panthers.",

Both sides exchanged the lead numerous times before Patna Pirates inflicted an all out with less than 40 seconds left to take the lead, and with it, win the match. Dabang Delhi captain had a mammoth 19 points, but it went in vain as he received no support from his secondary raiders and that cost them dear.\n\nDabang Delhi's decision to field Vishal Bhardwaj in place of Ashish in the left corner and playing Meetu Sharma in crucial raids also hurt them as they missed out on a chance to inch closer to their second title.

    "raw_text": "Haryana Steelers produced one of the biggest upsets in Pro Kabaddi League [PKL 10] history as they stunned defending champions Jaipur Pink Panthers to reach their first-ever final. Haryana Steelers, who joined the PKL fold in season 5, will take on two-time finalists Puneri Paltan for the ultimate prize.\n\nHaryana Steelers made their intentions clear from the get-go as their defence was in fine shape. Their back-line amassed 11 tackle points, which was five more than Jaipur Pink Panthers' famed defence. Arjun Deshwal was the defending champions' trump card and he lived up to the expectations by clinching 14 raid points, but he was let down by a weak defence.\n\nArjun had no support from his secondary raiders, while Vinay [11 raid points] and Shivam Patare [7 raid points] were in sublime form for Haryana Steelers. The one gamechanger was Ashish, who is typically a raider but in a solid shift as a defender. he picked up four tackle points, which included a tackle on Arjun in the final minute of the game. That tackle sealed the win for Haryana Steelers.\n\nThey will be up against a resolute Puneri Paltan side, who decimated three-time champions Patna Pirates in the first semifinal. Each member of Puneri Paltan's starting seven got on the scoresheet as the side put up a stunning all-round display. Mohammadreza Shadloui was the pick of the players as he finished with a superb High 5, while captain Aslam Inamdar and Pankaj Mohite bagged seven points each to lead Puneri Paltan to a stunning 16-point win.\n\nThe fact that Haryana Steelers and Puneri Paltan will face-off in the final means we will have a new PKL champion this time around. This is also the first time since season six that a team outside of the top-2 [at the end of the league stage] will play in the final.\n\n(You can re-live the PKL 10 semifinals via our live blow below. Please wait a few seconds for the blog to load. If it still doesn't, please click here)\n\nPuneri Paltan vs Patna Pirates\n\nPuneri Paltan have enjoyed their best PKL season ever and finished the league-stage on top of the points table. Every aspect of their game has clicked for them, whether it be raiding or defending, and they've built a formidable unit this time around. Aslam Inamdar has marshalled this young side remarkably well, Mohit Goyat has evolved into a fantastic all-rounder and Mohammadreza Shadloui continues to remain a terror for opposition raiders.\n\nIn fact, Shadloui will be up against his former side as Patna Pirates are gunning for a record fourth title. Led by Sachin Tanwar, Patna Pirates earned a thrilling win over Dabang Delhi in the semifinal and will hope to get past Puneri Paltan today. They will bank on the services of their raiding genius Sachin, who has 166 raid points in 21 matches, including 37 do-or-die raid points. Krishan Dhull is the side's top defender with 76 tackle points, while Ankit is also a handy all-rounder. Also watch out for Sandeep, he played an instrumental role in the final 10 minutes of the playoff win over Dabang Delhi.\n\nPKL 10 midseason grades: Puneri Paltan get A+, F for Telugu Titans\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers vs Haryana Steelers\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers can pretty much do it all. Having retained their core ahead of the season, they are one of the most balanced units this season and that explains their 13-match unbeaten run this season. Arjun Deshwal will all but climb back to the top of the standings for most raid points, while their defence is led by last season's best defender Ankush Rathee, who already has 69 tackle points to his name. The side is captained by Sunil Kumar, one of the smartest captains in the world of kabaddi and it will be a fine contest to see how he plots a win over Manpreet Singh's Haryana Steelers.\n\nArjun Deshwal - Jaipur Pink Panthers' raider for all seasons\n\nHaryana Steelers, making their debut at the semifinals, have had a strong season. They outclassed Gujarat Giants in the playoffs and showed just what they were capable of: playing to their defensive might while their raiders added to the tally. Their three-man defensive unit of Jaideep Dahiya, Mohit Nandal and Rahul Sethapal has over 200 tackle points, so watch out for that. They don't have a star raider as such, but Vinay has been their go-to man. Shivam Patare and Vishal Tate are also good raiding options, while Siddharth Desai always remains an asset [provided he is fit].",

However, the Indian came back in the next sequence with a takedown that gave him two points for the lead in the bout.\n\nThe first round was a high-scoring affair, which ended with Aman claiming two separate takedowns, one with just a second left on the clock, as the Indian went into the midway point with a 6-3 advantage.\n\nPath to Paris: After takedown of his idol, Aman Sehrawat wants his Olympic medal\n\nCruz took the first points of the second period as well with a two-point takedown, but Aman once again wasted no time in coming back with a takedown of his own, and then followed it up with another, as he took a five-point lead with just a minute to go. He extended that lead with a stunning reversal and counterattack that gave him two points more, to effectively close the bout out with 37 seconds left on the clock.\n\nAman started his campaign on Thursday with two wins on technical superiority over North Macedonia's Vladimir Egorov and Albania's Zelimkhan Abakarov.

    "raw_text": "The badminton caravan is in India for the second week of the new season, as the India Open Super 750 starts in frigid New Delhi from Tuesday with the hosts fielding their largest-ever contingent.\n\nHeadlining this Indian team will be the likes of PV Sindhu - starting her new season at home after her wedding in December, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty - last year's losing finalists hoping to go one better this time, Lakshya Sen - looking for his first win of the season along with bunch of young Indian players who'll get a chance to play the best at home, both via direct entry and some being promoted from reserves. The expectation will be that of a title, but it won't be an easy path for India's top stars.\n\nThe India Open has been upgraded to a Super 750 since 2023, which means it a mandatory event where all top players participate - and no Indians have won a title since 2022. This year, 16 and 13 of the Top 20 in men' and women's singles respectively will be action, making this an uber-competitive tournament despite a bunch of late withdrawals, such as that of defending champion and world No 1 Shi Yu Qi. The draws have not exactly made things easy, with tricky matches for Indians early on in New Delhi. But home advantage can be a huge factor and players will be looking to make the most of playing in front of cheering fans to set the tone for the year ahead.\n\nHere's a look at the top Indians' draw and chances in New Delhi:\n\nMen's Singles\n\nLakshya Sen, who was crushed in his season opener last week, will hope to get his bearings back in front of a home crowd that has always backed him vociferously. He starts against Lin Chun-Yi, who replaced eighth seed Antony Ginting's spot in the draw after his withdrawal. Lakshya trails 1-0 against Chun-Yi, but they haven't played each other for the last seven years. A win could see him take on Christo Popov, whom he leads 5-2.\n\nIf the cards land correctly, India Open could see another round of that very familiar Lakshya vs Prannoy match-up.\n\nHS Prannoy, who last week showed sparks of his vintage fighting best returning from a five-month injury layoff, starts against Li Yang Su, who had beaten the Indian in their only encounter at last year's England Open. Last year, Prannoy was the last standing Indian in singles reaching the semifinals. This year though, it will be tricky with a potential second round against 2nd seed Jonatan Christie... and a possible quarterfinal against compatriot Lakshya.\n\nPriyanshu Rajawat, who beat Lakshya last year before losing to Prannoy, also has a tough opener against 6th seed Kodai Naraoka.\n\nThis tournament will also see the return of Kidambi Srikanth, who got promoted from reserves late on Monday and will start his 2025 season. Former world no. 1 Srikanth, who was absent from the BWF Tour first due to injury and then his wedding, has fallen to 41 in the rankings and no longer makes a direct cut for the big tournaments. India Open thus will give him a shot at getting some crucial rankings points in a familiar setting. He begins his campaign against Chinese left-hander Hong Yang Weng, whom he leads 3-1 in their head-to-head. If the Indian wins, he will be up against 5th seed Li Shi Feng.\n\nAlso promoted from reserves is Kiran Goerge, who will play Yushi Tanaka in the first round.\n\nMen's Doubles\n\nRealistically, all eyes will be on Satwik-Chirag for an Indian title at the India Open. Satwik and Chirag reached the final last year, only to be tactically taken down by Seo Seungjae (a perpetual thorn in their side) and Kang MinHyuk. There was a repeat in the Malaysia Open semis last week, by Seo and new partner Kim Wonho.\n\nIn short, Satwik-Chirag will be fired up and that'll be a crucial ingredient given their draw.\n\nThe 7th seeds start against Wei Chong Man and Kai Wun Tee, whom they lead 3-0 in H2H, and could face fellow Indians K Sai Pratheek and Pruthvi K Roy in the second round. But it's the quarterfinal that will be a fascinating battle, potentially against Kim Astrup and Anders Rasmussen - now top seeds and the Indians' old rivals. The Danes are often involved in mental games- and even cheeky verbal volleys - against the Indians in the press, but were soundly beaten in the quarterfinals last year with Chirag calling out their on-court antics. If the draws hold, we could have another grudge match on our hands, this time with the Danes as the higher-ranked pair. They were stunned in the first round last week and will be fired up themselves.\n\nP.S.: Seo is in the other half of the draw, as are defending champions and second seeds Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang and nemeses Aaron Chia and Soh Woo Yik.\n\nWomen's Singles\n\nThe headline act here is the return of Sindhu - newly-married and very motivated after taking a break to recover from the Olympics heartbreak and an indifferent season which ended with a Super 300 title at Syed Modi.\n\nWith another new coach - Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama - this time as a group mentor, and a brand-new high-profile partnership with Puma, Sindhu said she has the fire and much more to achieve. She didn't play in Delhi last year on account of injury and will look to bank on the home support, which she enjoys plenty of, to kickstart a fresh season.\n\nSindhu begins against Sung Shuo Yun - who she leads 1-0 - after taking the place of withdrawn seed Busnan Ongbamrungphan and thereby getting a better draw than earlier. Gregoria Mariska Tunjung is the other seed in her quarter, which is the definition of tricky for the Indian. Sindhu has not been at her prime for a while now but she'll always be a contender given her calibre.\n\nIt'll be a tough road for the others, though. There will be an all-Indian clash in the opening round with Anupama Upadhyaya facing Rakshita Sree SR, who was promoted from reserves to Sindhu's spot. The winner will face Japan's rising star Tomoka Miyazaki. Fast-rising Malvika Bansod has been drawn against third seed Han Yue. While Malvika has made good progress, this will be a big test at home. Aakarshi Kashyap will face eighth-seeded Thai Pornpawee Chochuwong in the first round.\n\nWomen's Doubles\n\nThis is a stacked field for Indians with as many as nine pairs in the draw by virtue of it being at home. The seeded pairs are fifth-seeded team of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand, who will face Japan's Arisa Igarashi and Ayako Sakuramoto in the first round and seventh seeds Tanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponnappa, will take on compatriots Kavya Gupta and Radhika Sharma\n\nBoth seeded pairs have a relatively good chance to make a deep run at home in a women's doubles landscape that has seen some upheaval among top pairs. They didn't have the best of starts last week and will want to rectify that.\n\nThe other pairs are Rutuparna Panda and Swetaparna Panda, Mansa Rawat and Gayatri Rawat, Ashwini Bhat and Shikha Gautam, Sakshi Gahlawat and Apoorva Gahlawat, Sania Sikkandar and Rashmi Ganesh, Mrunmayee Deshpande and Prerana Alvekar, Amrutha Pramuthsh and Sonali Singh.\n\nMixed Doubles\n\nAnother stacked draw for India with Dhruv Kapila and Tanisha Crasto, K. Sathish Kumar and Aadya Variyath, Rohan Kapoor and G Ruthvika Shivani, Ashith Surya and Amrutha Pramuthesh, Tarun Kona and Sri Krishna Priya. There are no seeded Indians but this will be a good platform for some upset wins in home conditions.",

    "raw_text": "COURCHEVEL, France -- Mikaela Shiffrin finished 10th in a World Cup slalom race on her injury comeback on Thursday, with Croatian racer Zrinka Ljutic winning in style under floodlights at Courchevel.\n\nLjutic, 21, has won three of the past four slaloms. She was 1.26 seconds ahead of Sweden's Sara Hector and 1.28 clear of Germany's Lena Duerr.\n\nShiffrin, 29, was 2.04 seconds adrift. Chasing a record-extending 100th World Cup win, the American was fifth after the first run on the Stade \u00c9mile-Allais course but struggled with her timing on both runs.\n\n\"I didn't come into this race expecting that I was going to win,\" Shiffrin said. \"I have to be at my top, top level. Now we build from here.\"\n\nShiffrin crashed on Nov. 30 in a giant slalom in Killington, Vermont, and was injured sliding down the mountain. A couple of weeks later, the two-time Olympic gold medalist had abdominal surgery to clean out a puncture wound.\n\nShiffrin said before this race that she was prioritizing her recovery ahead of chasing the magic 100.\n\n\"It was a very important step in my recovery to see how I'm stacking up with the top skiers in the world, and to see what I can work on to improve my skiing,\" Shiffrin said. \"Also before the world championships it was so important to get this start.\"\n\nThe worlds in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria are next month, where Shiffrin will be eyeing medals in giant slalom and slalom.\n\n\"For sure I want to target the GS and slalom and everything really depends on the next 10 days until those races, how it goes with training,\" she said. \"I'm catching up to the fastest in the world so I have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nA massive 62 of Shiffrin's 99 World Cup wins have been in slalom. She cupped her hands and then waved to the crowd after finishing her second run.\n\nNo other skier, male or female, has won more than 86 World Cup races.\n\nHaving overtaken Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark, she needed a podium finish to equal Stenmark's record of 155 World Cup podiums.\n\nShe was not quite ready to aim for that.\n\n\"It felt challenging and the top women they are are skiing amazing,\" Shiffrin said. \"I am so happy to be back competing with them, hopefully I get faster in the next weeks.\"\n\nChasing a seventh straight win in slaloms, Shiffrin was the sixth racer to start at shortly after 5 p.m. local time and with the slightly fading light.\n\nShiffrin was a bit low on her skis but made up some time on the bottom section, finishing .87 seconds behind first-leg leader Ljutic, who crossed the line in 51.88 seconds.\n\n\"I want to watch the video from the first run. It was like a little bit of my timing or rhythm [was missing] to catch the track in the right way,\" Shiffrin said. \"I had some really good turns and some not fast turns.\"\n\nA smiling Shiffrin walked over to hug Ljutic as the young Croat sat watching from the leader's chair. Ljutic had to pinch herself after winning a such a dominant race.\n\n\"I'm living the dream now so don't wake me up,\" she said.\n\nShiffrin's been in Ljutic's position so many times before, but her expectations were more realistic after two months out.\n\nSwiss racer Wendy Holdener was second after the first run but she lost balance and missed a gate early in her second run.\n\nAustrian Katharina Liensberger placed fourth ahead of Switzerland's Camille Rast, who won the previous slalom in Flachau.\n\nWorld slalom champion Laurence St-Germain of Canada placed 36th in the first run -- around 3 seconds behind Ljutic -- and so did not make the second stint.\n\nRast leads the slalom standings with 450 points ahead of Ljutic on 409 and with Shiffrin in ninth on 226.\n\nItalian Federica Brignone leads the World Cup standings, with Shiffrin down in 17th.",

    "raw_text": "This story appears in the Heroes Issue of ESPN The Magazine. Subscribe today!\n\nThe boy focused his hurt and longing into his love for a baseball player named Dale Murphy. These were feelings he couldn't process or even understand until years later, but he found comfort following the Braves. Joel Bronson was his name. He could have been any kid born between 1972 and 1978 anywhere within reach of the TBS satellite but most likely in the Southeast. Joel grew up in Florida, raised by a single mom. He longed for a relationship with his absent father and filled that hole with admiration for Murphy. Joel loved Dale. He watched all the Braves games on TBS. Finally in 1991, after Murphy had been traded and Joel's grandmother had died, he sent Murphy a two-page letter. Normally he wrote chicken scratch, but on this one he worked hard on his handwriting. Joel told Murphy he'd been a \"father figure\" to him. Teenage boys often hide their weakness behind subwoofers and cigarettes, but Joel shared his grief over the loss of his grandmother. The pain poured out, and he felt better.\n\nJoel became a teacher and coach. He kept communing with his younger self, shelling out money to attend Braves fantasy camp or to purchase something called the MVP Experience, where fans got to watch a game in a suite with Dale and Nancy Murphy. For years, he'd show up at these events until he actually came to know Dale a little bit. They even exchanged numbers. Last year he decided to go to Braves fantasy camp one last time, now a 44-year-old man with three disintegrating vertebrae who needed physical therapy several times a week just to stay on the field. He wore No. 3.\n\nThe first night, with everyone meeting at an Orlando bowling alley, he texted Murphy to see if he needed a ride. To his surprise, Murphy said yes. Joel and his roommate pulled up to an Orlando hotel. Playing coy, Joel didn't tell his passenger where they were going or that he'd gotten to know their boyhood hero. Sitting in the back seat, his roommate saw a tall, familiar man loping out of the sliding doors, getting closer and closer to their car, until he realized that Dale F'n Murphy would ride with them.\n\n\"You got to be kidding me!\" the roommate blurted.\n\nMurphy got into the car, and Joel told him stories about his childhood. Soon they arrived in the parking lot of the bowling alley. Murphy smiled.\n\n\"Hey, I got a story!\" he said.\n\nDale explained that his wife, Nancy, had found old fan letters while cleaning out their home and that he'd taken a picture of one in particular. Murphy handed his phone to Joel, who didn't immediately recognize the careful, neat handwriting in the photo. The letter was dated June 17, 1991.\n\n\"Who wrote this?\" Joel asked.\n\n\"You did,\" Dale Murphy said.\n\nI SENT A letter too.\n\nJoel and I are two of the thousands of TBS Kids, or Generation Murph, or whatever you'd like to call us. Most of us were born during the presidency of Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter, and we fell in love with baseball watching the Braves on the Superstation. We hung the posters of the lanky center fielder in loopy midswing stride -- too wide a loop and too long a stride, time would prove -- and we wanted to grow up just like him. We told him so. Our letters arrived at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, 50 or more a day for a decade, as Murphy perennially battled Mike Schmidt for the NL home run title and won back-to-back MVP awards, one of four outfielders in baseball history to accomplish that. We read the stories about Murphy's kindness and charity, how he didn't drink or smoke or curse and how he signed every autograph. We imagined meeting him over big glasses of milk and talking about his moonshot home runs. Around the South, we fought over who'd wear No. 3. For Ron's Heating & Air in Clarksdale, Mississippi, I won the fight. Everyone on the team had his name ironed on except me; my parents forbade me to get \"Murphy\" on the back, and I told them I'd rather have no name at all if I couldn't wear the name of my hero. My jersey stayed blank.\n\nGeneration Murph has grown into middle age. We are 35 years removed from his peak as a player. He lives mostly anonymously in Utah with his wife and eight grown children. The last time he entered a news cycle was five years ago during his final year of regular eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame. He never really came close to selection and dropped off the ballots, despite his two MVP awards, his 398 career homers and his status as one of the most beloved players of the early and mid-1980s. You either idolized Dale Murphy or you don't remember much about him.\n\n\"There's a very specific historical and cultural moment that he's forever associated with,\" says his oldest son, Chad Murphy. \"For the Southeast in particular, it was something larger than life. There was some mythmaking, but the reality was, that was him. That was just literally him.\"\n\nNext year Murphy will be eligible again for the Hall of Fame through the Eras Committees, composed of journalists, executives and former players. There's a statistical case to be made for his inclusion in Cooperstown, but to past voters, his numbers have fallen just short. That's what makes his candidacy so interesting. The steroid era ballots prove that morals matter. The voters believe a person can be bad enough to discount statistics that exceed any barrier to the Hall -- yet they don't believe someone can be good enough to elevate stats that land just below. \"My dad is the perfect case study,\" Chad says. \"You open it up to complex moral questions that people are uncomfortable with.\"\n\nHe isn't complaining, more fascinated than anything else. He's got a Ph.D., and this kind of anthropology intrigues him. He calls it a \"bigger American question.\" Both of us talked about a culture that doesn't seem capable of acknowledging right and wrong -- a culture that still believes in bad people but no longer believes in good ones. \"Do we value performance at all costs,\" he asks, \"or do we want to be more holistic in how we value people and their accomplishments?\"\n\nDALE AND NANCY Murphy live on a manicured corner in a Rockwell American town. Alpine, Utah, has a white gazebo. Their house is nice but not extravagant. They greet me together at their front door. The only clue inside that a former ballplayer lives here is a photo of Dale at spring training holding two of his grandsons, all of them wearing matching No. 3s. His two MVP trophies are in a closet upstairs. Their eight kids are grown -- Travis, their special-needs son, still lives with them -- and they're looking to downsize. Together, they're hilarious, with Nancy alpha-momming and Dale shrugging and laughing and raising his arms to the sky. The kids compare them to the couple from Modern Family.\n\n\"They all say Dale and I are like Phil Dunphy and his wife,\" she says. \"She's a little high-strung, and he's a little forgetful.\"\n\nWe sit down, and they describe how Generation Murph looked from the inside, what they experienced in the gaze of all the TBS Kids. His sudden fame startled them. Chad would see his dad on TV and walk around to the back of the set to look for him. Fans knocked on their door, and at least one walked uninvited into the backyard. With a new kid on the way seemingly every season -- Nancy had two miscarriages, so that's 10 pregnancies in 13 years -- her father closed his medical practice and her parents moved to Georgia to be close. Their Mormon faith helped them navigate the chaos.\n\nThe family often waited in the shadows for an hour or more as Dale signed autographs and visited with kids. During one long autograph session, Chad looked at his mom and asked, \"Is Dad going home with them?\" That hit Dale hard and would never leave him. It's strange that being nice could be a problem, but it became one. Being kind is easy and a huge dopamine hit. For Murphy, the invitations were endless, which meant endless opportunities for immediate positive feedback. He knew people saw him as the guy who said yes, and he didn't want to tarnish that reputation. Nancy found herself eavesdropping on phone calls from the other room, trying to suss out what he might be agreeing to so she could manage it. Once she heard him a few days before Thanksgiving talking to a Boy Scout leader about camping on Thanksgiving eve on top of the Empire State Building. He did eke out a no, with her just shaking her head. \"We had our share of conflicts,\" Nancy says. \"For us, it was Dale saying yes to everything.\"\n\n\"Nancy and I were always battling that,\" he says. \"I was trying to say yes. I knew what I meant to those boys. And Nancy would say, 'No, these are the boys.'\"\n\n\"When you say yes to that thing,\" she says, \"you're saying no to us.\"\n\nHE MADE A real effort to keep his attention inward on his family. They sold their house in a regular neighborhood after the 1984 season and moved to a 10-acre farm behind a gate. \"Murphy\" wasn't on the mailbox. Pines and oaks hid the house. They had a pond with two swans. Dale and his family worked together in the garden, growing things like tomatoes, cucumbers and squash. He built them a scarecrow to protect the crop.\n\nIn public, he was still Dale Murphy: seven-time All-Star, winner of the 1988 Roberto Clemente man of the year award.\n\nIn private, he was Dad.\n\nNancy kept reminding him to re-center. There's a picture he thinks about a lot. It's a candid of him in the bowels of Candlestick Park on a pay phone. The game is about to start, a crowd cheering and waiting to see its heroes in the flesh, but he's calling Nancy and his family. He's calling home.\n\nHe didn't miss a game between 1982 and 1985. His career began a sharp decline after 1987. His home runs slowed, but the strikeouts did not. He was traded in 1990 to the Phillies, hoping to get out of what he called a \"rut.\" His longtime rival Mike Schmidt even sent a videotape that showed some ways of dealing with the effects of age on a swing. Three years later, he took a pay cut to move to the expansion Rockies. Injuries and a staph infection left him hobbled, a shell of his former self. Halfway through the season, and playing in the thin air just two home runs shy of 400, he couldn't do it anymore. A lot of guys would have stayed to get those last two homers, but he missed his family.\n\nHe called Nancy and told her he couldn't even run. \"I'm coming home,\" he said.\n\nNow, 25 years later, her voice cracks telling that story. She was pregnant then with Madi, their youngest.\n\n\"I can't even explain it,\" she says. \"There are no words. I had a weight lifted off my shoulders: 'Oh, thank you, thank you ...'\"\n\nThey left Georgia and, after managing Mormon missions in Boston, settled in Utah. Dale faded from the spotlight.\n\nHis whole life he'd been a ballplayer.\n\n\"He was really trying to find himself,\" Chad says. \"'Who am I now?'\"\n\nDale decided he was a father and devoted himself fully to the kids. He didn't get crazy rich, but he'd made enough as a player to never miss a moment now as a dad. The madness of their home became his life. Eight children, seven of them boys, all big enough that three would play college football. Every day, they collectively drank a gallon of milk and ate three dozen eggs. The boys shared underwear and socks, picking them out of a massive bin. Holes got knocked in walls. Dale would find a Nolan Ryan-signed baseball in the bushes. Nancy did 10 loads of laundry a day. They tried to support everyone's dreams. \"The thing we figured out as parents,\" Nancy says, \"you gotta let them find what they love on their own. The thing you have to tell your child to stop doing to go to sleep, that's the thing they love.\"\n\nDale drew with his son Tyson or called former NFL players for advice for Jake. He'd come home with records he thought were cool, listening to Death Cab for Cutie because he thought Chad might like them. Chad didn't really like Death Cab, but even then he realized that his dad was trying to find common ground they could share during turbulent teenage years. After Dale retired, Chad told his father he wasn't going to try out for the basketball team. He had other interests. He liked music.\n\nThat night, Dale took Chad to a store and got him an electric guitar.\n\nIN THE YEARS after baseball, the Murphy kids don't remember Dale bringing up the Hall of Fame, and with his next window of eligibility coming soon, it remains other people who talk about it most often.\n\nThere's no precedent at work, or one to be set, by his candidacy. He's an outlier. He finished his career in the steroid era, the exact kind of player who would have benefited greatly from some anti-aging elixir. His decline happened as the Bash Brothers were born. He remembers sitting in the Braves' clubhouse with Glenn Hubbard and talking about players juicing. Hubbard turned to him and said, \"You know how many home runs you could hit if you got on steroids?\"\n\nIf baseball wants to wash itself clean from steroids, the best way to do it isn't to keep Bonds out of the Hall but to let Murphy in. Induct cheaters but also celebrate Dale Murphy for his 398 home runs and for the dozens he did not hit. He finished just two short of 400, and only four eligible players not linked to steroids have 400 or more homers and are not in the Hall. None was ever MVP. Murphy's recognition is a vote about the culture we want. That's the point Chad Murphy made five years ago in an open letter to Hall of Fame voters. He titled it: \"Making the HOF Case for Dale Murphy, or, The Guy Who Changed My Diapers.\"\n\nIn Dale's last year of regular eligibility, his kids all got involved in big and small ways. They tweeted and gave interviews. Chad's letter went viral, and his argument helped drive Murphy's vote percentage higher than it had been in 13 years. Taylor Murphy started an online petition. He printed the names and gave them to Dale, to say: All these people love you. His children's table-pounding felt like the greatest validation of Dale's choices about focusing on his family instead of his fame. In the end, getting in didn't matter nearly as much as seeing how much his children wanted him to get in.\n\n\"What the kids did, it was the most emotionally moving time for me as a father,\" he says. \"All those years of saying our family comes first ...\"\n\n\"... it was about the Hall of Fame,\" Nancy says, \"but it was more about how much they loved him.\"\n\nTyson Murphy, a successful video game artist, drew a comic strip that ran in USA Today. Dale says opening the email and seeing the attached drawing remains one of the great milestones of his life, like his wedding day or the birth of his children. The first four panels show Murphy in his Braves uniform holding a bat and signing autographs and looking out from magazine covers. Tyson wrote: \"When I was younger, my dad brought cities to their feet. He inspired millions. He was a hero.\"\n\nThe last panel shows an enormous dad and a wide-eyed boy drawing together at a small table.\n\n\"But he was more than that to me,\" Tyson wrote. \"He was my dad.\"\n\nDALE AND I meet in Atlanta on a spring evening and walk to his restaurant, located near the Braves' new ballpark. Murph's has been open a year, part of Dale's attempt to occupy his time now that the kids are out of the house. Truth is, he likes it most because he gets to walk through his dining room and greet his fans, who are always happy to see him. Tonight, within minutes, a grown man tells him that he wore No. 3 in Little League. Someone surprises her husband with Dale on FaceTime and her husband cries.\n\n\"It hits you harder,\" Dale says. \"I've got 12 grandkids now, and when people come up to me and share stories, it's hard to put into words exactly what an honor it was to be part of their lives.\"\n\nHe's stopping and starting, searching for the words.\n\n\"I'm very thankful,\" he says. \"I'm thankful for that chance to be their ...\"\n\nHis voice trails off. He can't bring himself to say \"hero.\"\n\n\u0093Dale is definitely one of the only people we trust to baby-sit.\u0094\n\n- Murphy's daughter-in-law Kelsey\n\n\"When we both turned 60, it really hit me,\" Nancy says, \"and I talked to Dale about it. You look back and you say, 'OK, oh, I get it!' Like, everything we did was putting a brick into building this world ... this life for ourselves. You know? We build this life together. And we have these amazing kids and this beautiful family. I was telling one of my kids, when you stay up late at night talking a child through a problem, you might feel like that time was wasted. It's not. It's one of those bricks that you're putting in your life. And you get to 60, it's so satisfying to look back and say, 'We built this together.'\"\n\nHe's 62 now. The kids are funny and well-adjusted. They're high achievers. Three sons made it into NFL camps; the youngest just signed with the Rams. One is getting a business-and-law degree from BYU. One is the art director for Riot video games in LA. Another is a professor at Oregon State and an author of comic books written under his pen name, Lord Birthday. (He has 200,000 Instagram followers.) The youngest, Madi, just got her first job and is so much like her father. She too lights up a room.\n\nAfter years of focusing inward on his family, Murphy is finding he enjoys being remembered. He likes the card shows. On a family vacation to Disney World, his kids spotted a man wearing a Braves No. 3 jersey and goaded Dale into introducing himself. He never would have done that 20 years ago. \"It has been interesting to see him learn how to manage the Dale Murphy Persona,\" Chad says. \"It's this ghost of himself that means a lot to people.\"\n\nWe leave the restaurant and walk across a footbridge toward SunTrust Park.\n\nWe pass a billboard for a concert.\n\n\"Jason Isbell's coming,\" he says. \"Isn't he something?\"\n\nTurns out, Dale liked those records he bought to find a common interest with Chad. Today he is a huge indie-rock nut, which surprises no one more than his own children. On his old blog, he wrote about mashing together Abbey Road and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. He's gotten to know the guys in Wilco and R.E.M., and Chad once sat at a Mexican restaurant in New York with his dad, Peter Buck and Michael Stipe, trying to process how his square Mormon father now ran with rock stars. The members of R.E.M., of course, came of age in the late '70s and early '80s in Georgia, which makes them prime Generation Murph. Bassist Mike Mills wrote a song about Murphy's failure to get into Cooperstown: \"Forget all the liars, all the Sosas and McGwires ... I wanna see Dale Murphy in the Hall of Fame.\"\n\n\"He said it's a great punk rhythm,\" Murphy says.\n\nA WEEK LATER, on my last day in Utah with the Murphy family, we drive for lunch up into the fog past a riffling trout stream to the Sundance ski resort. The air is bracing. We hear birds singing through the timberline. Dale likes it up here. Just the quiet and the separation. He used to have to look hard to find silence in the circus of his life, but the kids have moved out. Now it's just Dale, Nancy and Travis.\n\nAt the restaurant, we find a big round table in the middle of the room.\n\nSoon Taylor comes in with his family.\n\n\"Hey, bud!\" Dale says with a grin when he sees them.\n\n\"Hey, Dad!\" Taylor says.\n\nDale swoops up the little boy, Hollis, and takes him to the fireplace in the center of the room, pointing at the glowing hearth and making crackling fire gestures with his hands. Because I'm here, everyone rushes to tell Dale stories, which makes the enterprise worth it, because he's forced to sit there and take the compliments. \"The one thing I can contribute,\" his daughter-in-law Kelsey says, \"is that he is genuinely the sweetest grandfather I've ever encountered in my entire life, and that's including my dad.\"\n\n\"The kids love him!\" Nancy says.\n\n\"He is definitely one of the only people we trust to baby-sit,\" Kelsey says.\n\n\"If Nancy's with me,\" Dale says, trying to steer the attention away.\n\n\"You don't get bored,\" Nancy says. \"You'll just sit there forever with them and just play with them.\"\n\n\"That's because I'm just a kid,\" Dale says.\n\nThey tell a story about one of the granddaughters with Dale, who loves inventing activities. He took her to the store to buy seeds, and then they came home and planted marigolds together, a little kid and a lanky ex-ballplayer. Taylor follows with his own story about seeds his father planted. He's old enough to remember the end of Dale's career: the father-son games when they wore matching uniforms and spent long hours in the clubhouse. \"Growing up, I thought my dad was cool,\" he says. \"Also, and this is a religious part, but as someone who is LDS, sometimes you feel like, Will people think I'm weird because I'm Mormon? And then I would go in there and everyone loved my dad. Everyone was his best friend. That's what I always tell people. If I can be halfway like that ...\"\n\nDale looks like he might cry.\n\nI wish I could disappear and let this family have its moment, but I'm also glad to witness the rarest thing in the world: a man content with his choices. Baseball was most valuable to him because it gave him the freedom to be completely present as his children grew up, which led him here. All any of us can hope for is to love and be loved like this. Dale covers his eyes for a moment.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he says to his son.\n\nThe conversation moves on, but Dale is still running Taylor's compliment over in his mind. He rubs his son's shoulder and again whispers \"Thank you,\" as his voice lowers and he is overcome with his blessings.\n\nWright Thompson A senior writer for ESPN.com and ESPN The Magazine, Wright Thompson is a native of Clarksdale, Mississippi; he currently lives in Oxford, Mississippi.

Her previous season high was 36 against Georgia on Jan. 2.\n\nBlakes is the only Division I player -- men's or women's -- to score at least 50 points in a game this season.\n\n\"I told the team in the locker room that Mikayla had one of the most incredible performances that I've ever seen as a coach, and I've coached a lot of really good players for a long time,\" Vanderbilt coach Shea Ralph said. \"And that's not taking anything away from them. When you see player like her do what she did tonight, sometimes she makes things that are really, really hard to do look really easy. That's the sign of someone who is just gifted.\"\n\nBlakes' 53 points also tied the Exactech Arena at O'Connell Center scoring record set by LSU men's basketball player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf during the 1988-89 season. Blakes also becomes the first Commodore since 1999-2000 to have back-to-back games with 30-plus points.\n\nAdditionally, Blakes set the Vanderbilt women's basketball single-game scoring record, breaking Khamil Pierre's previous mark of 42 points, which was set on Dec. 17 vs. Evansville. Pierre scored only three points Thursday on 1-of-10 shooting but finished with 11 rebounds and three steals for Vanderbilt (18-4, 5-3 SEC).\n\nRa Shaya Kyle collected 23 points and 12 rebounds for Florida (11-11, 2-6).\n\nVanderbilt next plays host to Mississippi on Sunday. Florida will play Monday at Arkansas.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.",

    "raw_text": "The police camera clicked. Click. Click. Click. Each snap shattered a silence brought on by Houston's suffocating summertime heat. The lens pointed into a waist-deep hole.\n\nAt the bottom of the freshly dug grave lay a man in his late 40s with what appeared to be blood running from a gunshot wound to his right temple. More blood trailed from his nose. The man, clad in nothing but his underwear, had his arms pulled beneath his back as though he'd been bound.\n\nDetectives from the Montgomery County Constable's Office already knew his identity: Ramon Sosa, one of the best-known boxing trainers in southeast Texas. A former professional fighter, he'd taught pros and Olympic hopefuls how to spar the fast-paced Puerto Rican way. Dozens of kids from gangs and troubled backgrounds had funneled through his nonprofit Young Prospects Boxing program.\n\nHe also owned a successful gym less than two miles from this spot, surrounded by heavy forest on all sides and well-hidden from the bedroom community known as The Woodlands. The detectives knew too that Sosa's gym brought in about $20,000 a month, allowing the trainer and his wife to buy a fancy new house, cars, motorcycles and designer shoes and watches.\n\nGangs and money. That's what might have been behind this grim scene. But this wasn't a predictable crime at all. Once the camera stopped clicking, the lead detective spoke: \"We're done, Mr. Sosa. You can get up now.\"\n\nAnd with that, the man at the bottom of the grave opened his eyes.\n\nA DECADE EARLIER in another part of Houston, a young man known as Mundo walked out of jail. He'd just been acquitted after spending 14 months inside on a violent felony charge. Mundo joined his local gang when he was 12 and was shot six times in three incidents before he went to jail. When he got out, his future wife gave him an ultimatum: Pick her or pick the violent neighborhood where he grew up. He chose her and moved to the other side of town.\n\nHe was looking around the area for gyms and stumbled on a little place where one of the trainers, Ramon Sosa, always seemed to be surrounded by young fighters. \"His technique was different -- Puerto Rican boxing,\" Mundo says. \"He looked like a professional boxer. And I was like, 'I want that.'\"\n\nSosa was from Puerto Rico, having moved to Houston when he was very young. He had returned to the island when he became a professional boxer at 17 but quickly grew disillusioned with a business in which \"people are trying to make money off you in so many different ways. I was nothing but a piece of meat.\"\n\nHe returned to Houston and discovered that his real calling wasn't in the center of the ring but in the corner. Sosa began training pros from the Houston area, traveling to fights in Las Vegas and New Jersey. He visited the Playboy Mansion and posed for photos next to Hugh Hefner and Mike Tyson. \"Boxing at the professional level, it's entertainment,\" he says. \"You get to see a lot of celebrities. All bills paid and everything.\"\n\nBut he soured on the pro scene again and turned to young amateurs. \"They do it for the heart, for love, for something other than money,\" he says.\n\nHe had been a trainer for some 20 years when Mundo appeared in the little gym in 2005. \"He was different,\" Sosa remembers. \"He said he didn't want to fight, he wanted to learn how to box.\"\n\nThe relationship, Mundo says, was the first time any male figure took an interest in his life. \"He set the ground rules,\" Mundo says. \"He took it upon himself to check up on me. He didn't have to do that. It meant a lot.\" Recalls Sosa: \"He told me what had happened to him, the problems that he had with the law, that he was a gang member.\"\n\nMundo walked away from the gang and into Sosa's corner. Sosa, in turn, would later launch a nonprofit as a way to reach other kids like Mundo, who remembers thinking that he and Ramon \"could save one and every kid that came into the gym.\"\n\nAnd so it went for the next two years, until a night in 2007 when a woman stepped on Ramon Sosa's toe.\n\nHER NAME WAS Maria de Lourdes Dorantes, but everyone called her Lulu.\n\nShe was long and lean, with dark hair and swaying hips. \"I saw her when I first walked in. She was on the dance floor. They were playing salsa. I said, 'Man, this is a beautiful lady!'\"\n\nRamon had worn a Versace sweater and one of his most expensive watches to get inside the trendy Latin club in The Woodlands. He bought a beer and planned to just watch Lulu dance. But when she walked past him, she stepped on his toe with what he swears were 6-inch heels. They hurt. \"I was like, 'Oh my goodness.' I see stars. I bent down, and she was asking, 'Please, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What can I do?'\"\n\nRamon asked her to dance. It was the start of a whirlwind courtship.\n\n\"I think she caught me, captivated me,\" he says. \"This is a person that gives you massages, manicures, pedicures. If I had a drink, she would not even let me finish my drink. She would give me another one. Serve my plate. She was just overboard as far as the way she treated me.\"\n\nLulu had followed a wave of Mexican expats to The Woodlands, entering the United States on a visitor visa. Not legally allowed to work in the States, she paid the bills cleaning houses and working as a masseuse until she and Sosa married in 2009. A year and a half later, they opened Woodlands Boxing and Fitness. \"I was very happy,\" Ramon says. \"Very happy to see my dreams come true.\"\n\nThe gym pulled in about 200 clients. \"We are talking $18,000 to $20,000 a month,\" says Ramon, who has always worked a full-time job at a shipping company in addition to training boxers. \"We bought a brand-spanking-new two-story home. We bought motorcycles and cars. And Lulu liked to dress nice. She always loved to go into the store and buy everything you can think of. Money was spent. It was very good.\"\n\nMundo vividly remembers the first time he saw Lulu. \"She walked into the gym just calling the shots,\" he says. \"She put in a lot of work. She basically took care of the business.\"\n\nThe Sosas embraced Mundo, making him a part of their family. \"I wasn't even looking for a father,\" he says. \"But that's what Ramon acted like. And Lulu acted like a good friend.\"\n\nRamon sponsored Lulu, her mother and her two teenage children to help them obtain U.S. citizenship. It took about three years. Only then, Ramon says, did cracks appear in their marriage, including an altercation during a vacation to Puerto Rico.\n\n\"She knew what buttons to push to agitate me,\" Ramon says. \"We got into a little back-and-forth.\" When Lulu told Ramon she was going to call his mother, he remembers pulling the phone out of her hand and telling her, \"The problem is between you and me, not my mother. I'm a grown man.\"\n\nHe says Lulu called hotel security and claimed he was abusing her. After listening to both sides, the head of security told them to sleep in separate bedrooms.\n\nIn March 2015, Lulu filed for divorce. \"She wanted everything,\" Ramon says. \"She just wanted for me to leave and she keeps everything.\" He remembers telling her, \"If you want a divorce, we are going to divorce the right way. We split everything.\n\n\"But no, she wanted it all,\" he says. \"And that's where things get rough.\"\n\nAccording to Ramon, Lulu contacted sponsors of his nonprofit and accused him of embezzling money, causing them to drop Young Prospects and forcing the group to close. Lulu also told friends and clients that Ramon had abused her. His relatives, including his mother and adult daughter, tell E:60 they never witnessed him hitting any family member, including Lulu.\n\nInvestigators would later say they found no evidence to suggest any malfeasance involving Young Prospects, nor any evidence that led them to believe any of the abuse allegations against Ramon.\n\nLulu also complained about Ramon to Mundo, who tried to stay out of the situation. \"Tried. Tried is a good word,\" Mundo says. \"More like dragged into it.\"\n\nThree months after Lulu filed for divorce, Mundo walked into the gym on a hot night. Lulu was in the office with her teenage daughter. \"They were having a talk regarding some kid that had been at the gym, about his uncle being some kind of killer down in Mexico,\" Mundo says. \"They were saying he cuts up bodies.\"\n\nMundo walked into the office when he next heard Lulu wonder aloud if the uncle could help \"with our situation.\"\n\nHe was pretty sure \"the situation\" was Ramon and encouraged Lulu to confide in him. Mundo says Lulu started to talk the next morning. \"I'm just tired. I'm frustrated,\" he remembers her saying. \"I wish he will leave. I wish the cops would pick him up. I just wish somebody will make him disappear.\" According to Mundo, he asked, \"What do you mean 'disappear'?\" When he made a pistol sign with his fingers, Lulu replied, \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"I'm numb,\" Mundo remembers. \"I know what she wants.\" He walked to a punching bag to start his workout. But instead of hitting the bag hard like he normally would, he barely tapped it, too distracted by the thoughts swirling in his mind. He punched one last time and returned to Lulu.\n\n\"I might know somebody,\" he said.\n\nPACO WAS SO revered in his gang that his face had been painted on a mural at least two stories high. \"Paco is like the badass,\" Mundo says. Paco and John Boy, those were the men he'd contact.\n\nAt least, that's the story he concocted for Lulu.\n\nAs soon as he walked out of the gym, Mundo made the call -- but not to \"Paco.\" Instead, he called Ramon, saying, \"This lady wants to kill you.\"\n\n\"Shut the f--- up,\" Ramon told him. \"Stop playing. Don't play like that.\"\n\nRamon remembers Mundo saying, \"I've seen that look in people that want to kill before, and this lady wants to kill you.\"\n\n\"I was in shock. I was angry. I didn't know what to do,\" Ramon says.\n\nBut Mundo had a plan: \"I told Ramon, 'Look, you're going to play the hit man. You're going to buy another phone, a throwaway.'\" Mundo explained that the phone would be used as if it were Paco's. They went over the details and agreed Mundo should relay the message on the new phone that, for the right price, Paco would be willing to kill Ramon. Later, as Lulu watched, Mundo texted the burner phone back with her offer: $1,000 cash, along with Ramon's pickup truck.\n\nMundo: \"Paco im here with the Patrona ... y'all guys take a truck and 1g after job done? 07 white single cab 20 inch rims Si o No?\"\n\nPaco: \"I talked with johnboy n its all good homi just need the tools\"\n\nMundo's choice of the name \"Paco\" wasn't random. He was a character in the 1993 crime drama Blood In Blood Out, the story of three Chicanos navigating gang life in Los Angeles. Paco, played by Benjamin Bratt, was so admired and feared that another character paints his portrait on a concrete wall alongside the Los Angeles River.\n\n\"At the end of the movie, Paco, it turns out, is an undercover cop,\" Mundo says. He was sending Lulu a warning. \"It was cryptic,\" Mundo says. \"But you know, it just felt right.\"\n\nMundo started to secretly record his conversations with Lulu, hoping to gather evidence for Ramon.\n\nIn one recording, she sorts through Ramon's watch collection. \"A golden one, a Bulova,\" she says in Spanish. \"And a black one, which is a Fossil.\" She decides to use various watches, inexpensive jewelry and an additional $500 cash as a down payment.\n\nJust before the July Fourth holiday, Lulu handed Mundo $100 for the fictional hit man to buy a stolen gun. With the cash in hand, Ramon and Mundo agreed that Ramon should go to the police. But Ramon wanted Mundo to go too, a difficult step for a former gang member sworn to never talk to police about anything. \"Even if I try to make people understand that it's to save my friend's life,\" he explains, \"it's still seen as snitching. Ratting.\"\n\nJust walking into the Montgomery County Precinct 3 Constable's Office caused Mundo physical pain. \"My heart got knotted up,\" he remembers. \"The back of my head was all knotted up.\"\n\nIn the interrogation video, a detective asks Mundo, \"Has she specifically used the word 'dead'?\" \"Yeah,\" Mundo responds, pointing to a text message on his phone. \"Muerta.\"\n\nIn the video, Mundo spends more than an hour telling detectives everything Lulu told him. He hands over the $100 and the recordings he's made and allows the detectives to download the text messages she had sent to his phone.\n\nNear the very end of the video, Mundo decides to reveal his past. \"I used to be a gang member,\" he says. \"I've got a criminal past. So I'm pretty sure that's what attracted her to me.\"\n\nHe tries to explain to officers that coming forward could put him in danger. \"I broke a major code,\" he says. \"There will be consequences.\"\n\nLT. MIKE ATKINS describes sitting across the table from Mundo as \"kind of surreal.\" He remembers thinking, \"Is this legit? Because there is a divorce that is pending.\"\n\nHe checked out Lulu's complaints about Ramon and found no evidence to support them. When he sorted through Mundo's criminal record, \"his background coincided with the story of his life,\" Atkins says. \"Yes, he did get into a bit of trouble when he was a youngster, but there was no recent activity.\"\n\nThat background, maybe more than anything, convinced Atkins to believe Mundo. \"Knowing the code where he came from, people who snitch are not looked at favorably,\" the officer says. \"So his coming in this office, under his own free will, showed a lot of character.\"\n\nAtkins ultimately determined that \"Ramon's life was seriously in danger.\" He asked Mundo to keep recording Lulu. Mundo hated the idea but agreed.\n\n\"I can't say no,\" he says. \"Somebody's life is in the balance.\"\n\nMundo recorded at least 12 conversations, all in Spanish, over the course of three weeks, according to records E:60 obtained from the constable's office. In one, Lulu tells Mundo that Ramon might sign divorce papers on July 22. \"Mundo, I'm desperate. I can't stand this anymore. I have a giant headache,\" she says in the recording. \"I have everything to lose. I'm sick, sick, sick of all this paperwork.\"\n\nShe complains that she won't get any alimony, that Ramon is no longer paying the mortgage and that she's running out of cash. \"That f---er hasn't given me a single penny since February,\" she fumes. \"Nothing!\"\n\nShe adds: \"They better kill him before the 22nd. That way I'll have insurance for life, a pension for life. My life will be all figured out. Mundo, do you know what I'm saying? He has worked hard all his life for his retirement. Well, now it's time for me to work hard on my retirement. This is my retirement, Mundo. His life is my retirement.\"\n\nMundo asks, \"So from here until the court date, do you want to have him killed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nOn the recordings, Mundo tells Lulu several times that she can abandon her plan. \"If you changed your mind, you changed your mind. Nothing happens. Nobody's forcing you to do it.\"\n\n\"It's a decision I already made,\" Lulu says. \"If I say it, I do it.\"\n\nIn one final attempt, Mundo texted Lulu, \"Nomas aquerdese ... que ya Muerto ya va ser muy tarde pa que se aga pa atras entendido?\" Just remember, once he's dead, there's no coming back from that.\n\nLulu wrote back: \"Mas claro que el agua.\" Clearer than water.\n\nTHE HIDDEN-CAMERA video pans up the side of a car with the words \"Woodlands Boxing\" emblazoned on the door. A woman with dark, glossy hair and a Mona Lisa smile sits in the driver's seat.\n\nMundo, wearing the hidden camera, encourages Lulu to get out of her car to meet Paco, sitting in a pickup parked nearby. Lulu never suspects that Paco is actually an undercover officer as she climbs into the front seat of the officer's truck. Just as Mundo gets into the back seat, the officer's deep voice asks in Spanish, \"What's up?\"\n\nLulu vents in Spanish: \"Well, what hasn't he done to me? That SOB. I mean, I just can't deal with all of this.\"\n\nThe undercover officer replies, \"This guy, do you want him to be pretty beaten up? Well, f---ed over? Do you want us to beat him up or what?\"\n\n\"No. No beating,\" Lulu says without hesitation. \"I want him dead.\"\n\n\"Do you want to talk to him? Give him a last message?\" the officer asks.\n\n\"No. I don't want to talk to him,\" Lulu says.\n\n\"You just want him f---ed over? You want him dead?\"\n\n\"I want him dead,\" Lulu affirms. \"For me, it is better if he is dead than for him to continue screwing up my life.\"\n\nAtkins watched from another undercover vehicle as Lulu handed over her down payment. \"I was struck by the lack of emotion,\" he says. \"When you deal with someone who has no emotion, shows no empathy, no sympathy, those are truly, truly dangerous individuals.\"\n\nMundo remembers getting out of the truck with Lulu. \"We shake hands. I don't want to touch her. Not because of hate. It was just sadness. I feel like I betrayed her as a friend,\" he says.\n\nBut Lulu pulled his arm in for a hug. \"I think I held on for, like, two more seconds because I knew what time it was,\" he says. \"You know what is about to happen. But they don't.\"\n\nOFFICERS LEARNED HOW to fake Ramon's death by watching makeup tutorials on YouTube. They went to the grocery store for corn syrup and food coloring to make the blood and borrowed the makeup kit normally used for disaster drills. \"It looked like Halloween stuff they used for kids,\" Ramon says. \"It looks very, very amateur what they were doing. But they did it right.\"\n\nRamon remembers Atkins telling him, \"We need something that is going to be a slam-dunk case.\" The detectives had enough evidence to arrest Lulu but worried a jury might feel sorry for a beautiful woman with no police record.\n\nWhich is how Ramon found himself on the floor of an unmarked SUV as officers drove into a restricted area where dump trucks unload debris collected from county work sites. It was there, among the piles of earth, that they dug the grave. \"It wasn't cold, but it was eerie,\" Ramon says. \"I was sitting there with my eyes closed, thinking, 'What am I doing? What the heck am I doing here?'\n\n\"I thought about Lulu. Like, why did it have to come down to this? It could have been a simple divorce. It should never have happened.\"\n\nIn that moment, he says, he realized, \"She never loved me.\"\n\nOn July 22, Lulu climbed back into a truck that was supposed to be Paco's. This time, two hidden cameras capture her face as the officer tells her in Spanish, \"We got him in the morning.\" Lulu shows no visible reaction. She simply states, \"I've got $1,000.\"\n\nThe agent holds out a phone, showing her a photo of Ramon in the grave. \"What do you think?\" he asks.\n\nLulu still betrays no emotion. Instead, she digs for details. The undercover officer gives her just enough. Ramon fought for his life. He didn't want to die. The truck is at a chop shop. Lulu calmly suggests they use FaceTime to prevent the police from tracking their communications.\n\nShe pauses a moment and then says, \"He won't get up anymore.\"\n\nAnd that's when she laughs. \"That was bone-chilling,\" Atkins says.\n\nThe next morning, with Ramon in hiding, officers went to the gym, telling Lulu they received a missing person report for her husband. \"She doesn't have an explanation of where Ramon is. She hasn't seen him,\" Atkins says. \"So we have her lying to us immediately.\"\n\nPolice video shows officers placing Lulu in handcuffs in front of her mother and teenage daughter. They transported her to the same interrogation room in which they interviewed Mundo.\n\n\"At this point, I think she has accepted that she was duped,\" Atkins says. \"It's all coming to her now.\" She told police she wouldn't speak without her lawyer, and with that, police took her to jail.\n\nFifteen months later, in October 2016, Lulu pleaded guilty to solicitation of capital murder. She never looked at Ramon as a judge sentenced her to 20 years in prison. No one from her family ever spoke publicly in her defense. Lulu's last attorney of record said he was not authorized to speak on her behalf.\n\nLulu, now 44 and housed in a state prison in Gatesville, Texas, never responded to letters ESPN wrote seeking her side of the story. Through a prison spokesman, she refused an interview request. Ramon's last image of Lulu was of her leaving the courtroom in a pink jumpsuit and handcuffs.\n\nMUNDO SITS NEAR the spot in the gym where he told Lulu he might know somebody. The lights have all been turned off, the gym's door has been locked and its regular clients told to come back later.\n\nOnly a single light shines behind Mundo, creating a dark silhouette of his head on the camera monitors as he is interviewed by ESPN for TV. \"I appreciate this opportunity,\" he says. \"Because nobody, nobody ever, had asked me how, you know, how do you feel?\n\n\"Everybody was broken in a certain way,\" he says. \"It wasn't just Ramon. Lulu as well. Me as well, you know?\"\n\nLulu's case was widely covered by the Houston media, with Ramon giving quick sound bites at her sentencing. But then a TV show outed Mundo and an undercover officer, showing their faces on television and revealing Mundo's legal name. The constable's office got involved, and the story was pulled off the internet. But it was already too late. The time had come to pay the consequences.\n\n\"It was like a wave, man,\" Mundo says with a huge sigh. He's received threats of home invasion, threats against his life and against his wife, children and other family members who still live in the old neighborhood.\n\n\"Everybody's alive. That's how I try to reconcile everything,\" he says. \"Somebody is alive, and nobody's dead. At least for right now.\" He pauses. \"I hope nobody ever dies.\"\n\nHe closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. \"I'm just thinking of my family; that's all I think about now.\"\n\nHe self-published a novel titled My Son Mundo. It's a story of a man \"forced to make a final decision\" after he's \"drawn back into conflict with the law due to a threat to his mentor and boxing trainer.\" Some of it really happened, Mundo says, but some of it didn't.\n\nHe wrote the book to make enough money to get his family out of Houston. \"For me to have a happy ending is security for my family,\" he says.\n\nBut what about Mundo? Is he worried about himself?\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnd then his eyes well up. He covers his face with his hand. Just as quickly he pulls it away. He tips his head back and takes an angry breath through his nose. He's pissed, ready to fight. Not box. Fight. \"I don't like your question.\"\n\n\"Mundo's a tough cat,\" Atkins says. \"He grew up in a tough neighborhood. I think he's a tough customer.\" He gave Mundo his direct line and told him to call anytime. However, Atkins says, \"I have not spoken with him since.\"\n\nMundo has taken precautions to protect himself, but he says he has not received the help he was promised. \"Certain people said they are going to help me with security, you know? Upgrade my security. They didn't do s---. You're left for yourself. No, it shouldn't be like that.\"\n\nIs he talking about Ramon? Mundo almost doesn't answer. \"If somebody helps you and helps save your life, you shouldn't leave them out to dry. You shouldn't do that.\"\n\nRamon, now 51, doesn't shy away when asked about Mundo's intimation. \"We don't talk as much as we used to, you know? We kind of drifted a little bit apart,\" Ramon says. \"He doesn't understand that Lulu left me with a lot of debt.\"\n\nRamon, who continues working his day job while also training fighters, recently declared bankruptcy and has moved out of his house and the gym he and Lulu shared. He lives in a small apartment and has put all of their possessions into storage. \"This is all she left me with,\" he says, pulling out clear plastic bags containing his watches and the cash Lulu paid. \"Evidence of how she tried to kill me.\"\n\n\"Maybe one day I'll have a bonfire,\" he says. \"You know, just burn everything.\"\n\nHe locks up the storage space and gets in his pickup, the one with the 20-inch rims. \"I spend a lot of time alone now, to be honest with you,\" he says. \"Psychologically, I'm still not doing well. I still have nightmares.\"\n\nHe wonders whether Lulu stepped on his foot intentionally in that nightclub.\n\n\"I was a good husband. I treated her well,\" he says. \"All I've got to say is God, my God, knows what really happened.\"\n\nRamon says he's repairing his life one issue at a time. \"Mundo's always going to be on that list,\" he says. \"He's always up there, a priority.

    "raw_text": "Janneke Schopman is back to headline Indian women's hockey. Just 12 matches and 14 days since the inaugural Women's Hockey India League began, the final is all set between table toppers JSW Soorma Hockey Club and Schopman-coached second-placed Odisha Warriors at Ranchi's Marang Gomke Jaipal Singh Astro Turf Hockey Stadium on Sunday. (The match will begin at 6 PM IST)\n\nSchopman vs Menezes part II\n\nOnce again in Ranchi, Schopman will have a face-off with Soorma's Jude Menezes. A year back at the same venue, Schopman's Indian women's hockey team lost a crunch Olympic qualifying match against Menezes-coached Japan 1-0, shattering their Olympic dream. On Sunday now, Menezes will eye a repeat, while Schopman -- who resigned days after she made allegations of gender discrimination in Indian hockey -- will look for redemption of sorts by winning the first Women's HIL trophy.\n\nThey have, of course, faced each other before in the league stages, with Soorma securing a 2-1 win followed by a shootout victory for Odisha in the next match after a 0-0 draw. Before the tournament began, Odisha Warriors were the side to beat but as it progressed Soorma went from strength to strength and are now the best side in the league stage.\n\nSoorma's fluid attack vs Warriors' PC threat\n\nSoorma's strength has been their attacking hockey. They scored the most number of goals in the tournament (15) and the most number of field goals (12). Their attackers -- Charlotte Englebert, Charlotte Stapenhorst and Maria Verschoor have combined really well to deliver the goals along with support from Indian attackers, including the captain Salima Tete.\n\nIt's their fluid attacking play with efficient players at the top of the attack that really standout. It also helps when one of the best goalkeepers in the world - -Savita Punia -- is in fine form. While the heavy lifting, in terms of scoring goals, are done by the foreigners (Englebert has five), it doesn't mean no less credit for the Indian players. Sonam (4 goals), Hina Bano (two goals), Jyoti, Ajmina Kujur and Vaishnavi Vitthal Phalke have been solid. Credit should go to Menezes that he was able to extract the best from his foreign and Indian players.\n\nThe one area of concern for Soorma is their penalty corner conversion, with just one penalty corner conversion out of 26. Even Menezes agreed it has been an issue, but for now they have made it up with their field goals.\n\nMeanwhile, no player has scored more penalty corner goals in the tournament than the Warriors' Yibbi Jansen (five) and that's no surprise given Jansen is probably the best dragflicker in the world at the moment. Last year, Schopman's biggest concern had been PC conversions, this time her dragflick expert could make the difference and drag them to victory.\n\nWhile Jansen, who was the most expensive foreigner at the auction at Rs 29 lakh, has been their star player, Schopman's team also conceded the least number goals in six matches - just five. Defender Deep Grace Ekka and goalkeeper Jocelyn Bartram have been solid at the back. Deep Grace had, in fact, retired from international hockey when Schopman was at the helm last January, but she showed no signs of ineffectiveness on the pitch.\n\nCaptain and midfield mainstay Neha Goyal, Baljeet Kaur and Ishika Choudhary have been pretty impressive with their performances.\n\nSavita vs Jansen\n\nThe key battle to watch out for is between Jansen and Savita. The best scorer vs the best goalkeeper and both players really bring their best in big matches.\n\nAnother interesting one to follow in the midfield battle between the two captains. Salima, with ball carrying and pace as her big weapons, will look to create havoc while Neha, with her exceptional work rate, will aim for quicker transitions from defence to attack.\n\nQuotes from the pre-match PC\n\nNeha Goyal: \"Our main strength is our penalty corners. We will try to make as many PC opportunities as possible for Yibbi. They also have speedy forwards, it's the main match so we need to match their speed. We Indians think that our skills are good so we play a bit slowly and foreigners use their speed. We need to match their speed to make the game equal.\"",

    "raw_text": "Sakshi Malik has made history on the wrestling mat - the first Indian woman athlete to win an Olympic medal, till today the only Indian woman wrestler to win an Olympic medal. She has made headlines off the mat too, taking on the very powerful system and, if not winning completely, at least forcing a change of guard. Yet her most impactful achievement, in a broader sense, might be through a most unexpected route: her memoirs.\n\nThe underlying theme through most of *Witness - a refreshingly, at times brutally honest read, rare for an Indian public figure - is her advocacy for everyday women's issues, that are rarely spoken about. From something as seemingly trivial as negative body image amid societal beauty standards, to the need for women (athletes and others) to be financially independent, Sakshi has written one of the boldest books - even the most \"feminist\" - by an Indian sportswoman.\n\nIt would have been easy for her to focus on the historic medal, her unique career, and her continued spearheading of the wrestling protests now. But for her to repeatedly highlight women's issues - especially in an astonishing chapter titled 'Body Talk (A Small Digression) - makes this book one of the most important in Indian sport. This is everyday feminism at its essence, not a technical definition but the basic truth that genders don't get equal treatment, so women have to first know and then fight for their daily rights.\n\nNothing is off limits when talking about these issues, not even the most intimate details of her family life. For a self-professed avoider of confrontations, she says this book was a great medium to share her thoughts with the world. One of her most important life lessons came after the Olympic medal win. Her family was refusing to let her marry her longtime partner, fellow wrestler Satyawart Kadian, and had gone through elaborate attempts to try and block it. She soon realised, though, that their objection was partly financially motivated; an assumption that all her post-Olympic windfall would go to her marital home. Sakshi, whose banking was handled by her family, later discovered that her accounts were cleared out of the post-Olympics rewards she'd received.\n\nIn a lengthy chat with ESPN, Sakshi reaffirmed her thinking. \"They tell girls that they are anyway supposed to go to some other's [husband] house. And when they get to that some other's house, they are told that their house is the other one [parents']. So our financial security, our understanding... we need to have full knowledge of all it, we need to be independent.\"\n\nTo push to marry her partner was itself -- in the context of the extremely patriarchal society she lived in -- an act of bravery. No one in her circles had married for love and she did not want to malign her family reputation by going against their will. Eventually, she had to leak the news of her engagement to get her family's approval, because appearances matter.\n\nIt's a touching love story, almost Bollywood cinematic in its obstacles. But it's telling of the prevalent mindset in the majority of the country, where a woman's wealth and agency is not her own, even when she has won an Olympic medal.\n\nShe reveals the struggles and describes with honesty what it means to be a woman from Haryana, who has to consider the societal implications of simple actions like growing her hair out, talking to boys or wearing sleeveless clothing. Sakshi addresses her own naivete in these incidents candidly, intending it as both an indictment of the patriarchal society and a learning for young Indian women from her background. She has spoken about the imperceptible challenges of being a career sportswoman in a way no Indian athlete of her stature has before.\n\n\"I went all in on the wrestling during my career and never really paid attention to things like where's the money is going,\" she told ESPN. \"I had a straight focus: I want to wrestle. You must have read in the book also that I had no interest in other things like roaming around, partying, functions... My focus was always wrestling, getting into the Olympics and winning a medal. I just want to say that while this is a good thing - focusing on achieving your goal - you also need to be aware side-by-side of all the other things.\"\n\nShe even revealed that most of her felicitation appearances were a mask with this familial turmoil in the background. All while adjusting to dresses, make-up and high heels she was made to wear to look well-groomed in front of the camera. Any woman can attest to this being daunting in itself for the first time, to do it as a woman raised in a wrestling academy of Haryana, there's an added layer of insecurity.\n\nIncidentally, the one person who has pushed her to take charge of her finances early on was none other than Vinesh Phogat, who has been a compelling character in Sakshi's recollections.\n\n\"I wanted to talk about all this. I don't want other girls to go through what happened to me, what I faced after the Olympics because first a girl, secondly a sport like this... a girl's sporting career is very short, so we need to manage everything in it.\"\n\nLately, Sakshi has been in the news as one of the leaders of the wrestlers' protests against former WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a former MP from the BJP. He's been accused of sexual harassment of women wrestlers, and other administrational malpractice, and Sakshi has detailed the background and her role in the protests.\n\nThe most striking revelation is, without doubt, her unwavering detailing of the harassment she faced at the hands of Singh - a case which has finally been taken up in court after months of protests. That it had to be internalised, was an added shackle in her career and she has not shied away from any of the questions asked over.\n\n\"If I raised my voice, he'd never have let me reach this level. Me and everyone else kept quiet because we didn't have any other option,\" she says of the oft-asked \"why now\" question. (which in itself betrays the deep lack of understanding of gender dynamics that she has shed light in)\n\n\"Jab paani sar se upar chala jaata hain (when the water rises over your head), there comes a time when you must say something. We used to hear stories from our juniors and then we realised that we must raise our voices now. Our juniors won't because they will have the same fears that we did. We are financially secure, there's a strength to our voices now, people will listen. The sexual harassment in the federation can be stopped [by them] so we decided if we don't raise our voices no one will.\"\n\nThe fight, which she concedes is slow-moving, is still on, and she wants to see it to its conclusion.\n\nShe's even open to entering the administration, something she wasn't willing to before because it would subvert the purpose of the protests. She has the capability, and education - something she that gives her an edge because not many of her peers balanced academics.\n\nHer inclination to improve the lives and careers of young women in the field, many of whom she trains at her father-in-law's academy, goes beyond wanting to give back to sport. With Sakshi, the advocacy goes deeper. Her description of body image issues, financial literacy, stereotyping of certain women's grooming, covert sexual harassment is applicable to every field in India, not just sports. Almost all women have dealt with this in some form.\n\nWitness, such an aptly titled memoir, is Sakshi Malik's message to Indian sportswomen (and men) about things they should know but no one would tell them straight.",

    "raw_text": "When you first hear about Sheetal Devi, about how she plays her sport, you will find it difficult - if not impossible - to believe. An armless archer? Those two words don't go together. Then you see her in action, and the disbelief gets upgraded to incredulity -- from 'what are you saying?' to 'what am I even seeing?'. How do you explain what it feels like when you see something that you never had even imagined to be possible? That's exactly what it feels like when watching her.\n\nOnce you do see her, though, it's impossible to look away; Sheetal Devi in full flow is just the most amazing sight in world sport.\n\nPARALYMPICS 2024 KEY DATES | EVERY MEDAL WON BY INDIA AT THE PARALYMPICS | PARALYMPIC CLASSIFICATIONS EXPLAINED\n\nAs the world - videos of her have gone viral globally - found out in these Paralympic Games, that captivation is instant and inevitable. It starts with trying to comprehend the complex technique that makes this possible: the feet holding the bow up at eye level, the heavy equipment caught between her big toe and second; the mouth pulling back a band attached to the arrow, notching it to a special equipment attached to her shoulder; her using a combination of stretching out her leg holding the bow and the muscles in her chest and shoulder to draw the arrow back and release it with just as much force as any professional would with their hands. All in a couple of seconds, one smooth, balletic movement.\n\nThe aesthetics of it is key. Sport holds a natural fascination for us because it's other humans doing things brilliantly while looking fantastic doing it. Think of the great sights in world sport: Of a Neeraj Chopra in full flight, hurling himself and that javelin into the ether. A Mondo Duplantis flowing through the air and over the pole vault bar like he was floating on a personal cloud. A Simone Biles somersaulting into the air like she's entirely elastic. A Leo Messi dribble where he makes it look like the ball and he speak a language only they understand. A Syndney McLaughlin run where she eats up the track and the hurdles on it like it's a morning jog, except she's going faster around a lap than any woman ever. The aesthetics of these great athletes are impeccable, and the visceral thrill of seeing them in action speaks directly to our adrenal glands... but what sets Sheetal apart is how she combines all that with the base physical impossibility of doing what she does with her from-birth condition.\n\nIt takes remarkable body strength to pull it off -- but remarkable is what Sheetal brings to the table. After all, the power needed to do this was built up by her climbing trees when she was a child, using only her upper body and legs. Why did she do something so impossibly tough, you ask? Because she wanted to, and a lack of arms was not going to stop her. This is what makes her extraordinary -- unlike every other child, she would have had no model to learn this (or anything else) from but what she did was apply herself to the task, experiment and find a way to do it.\n\nUnder the wow factor of her technique, it's this steel will of hers that shines through the longer you watch her. Add to this her age: She's 17, at the very start of her career.\n\nBeing able to do something like this is one (huge) thing, being able to do it well at an elite level a whole different ball game... and there was no way Sheetal was ever going to do something in any way other than the latter. The more you see her in action, the more used to the technique you get (as used as anyone can get to watching the incredible), her sporting brilliance takes over your attention.\n\nYou see, unlike in Olympic archery where a few loose arrows or sets can be made up, para-archery demands constant perfection. Each arrow is counted towards the final cumulative score. Remember that clip of her hitting a dead-centre that went viral a few days ago? She does that again, and again, and again every time she competes... she has to shoot 8 arrows in every mixed compound match she plays, 15 in every individual match. The fact that at age 17 she has two Asian Para golds (one of those won by hitting six straight tens at the end), a World Championships silver, and a Paralympics silver in this most demanding sport is telling -- she's not just a rare genius, she's a consistent rare genius. The difficulty of being that cannot be overstated.\n\nWhile Sheetal is the only female 'armless' archer competing at an elite international level, there are three men who took part in this year's Paralympics under the same restrictions. Piotr Van Montagu of Belgium, Victor Sardina Viveros of Mexico, and the OG 'armless' archer Matt Stutzman of the USA. Stutzman, a four-time Paralympian, won his first gold in Paris a couple of days ago in a most stunning manner -- setting a Paralympic record with a frankly ludicrous score of 149/150.\n\nStutzman was, in fact, an inspiration for Sheetal's coaches. They had been struggling to find ways to get the best out of her after they'd found that prosthetics wouldn't fit, but stumbling onto Stutzman in their research cleared the path. 11 months after that training started, she was winning those Asian Games golds. A year on from that and here we are, a Paralympic games bronze hanging around her neck.\n\n\"Whenever I see the medals, I have won [until now], I feel inspired to win more. I have only just started,\" she had told the BBC earlier. This is not just a vision statement; it's backed up by her belief in-game. \"Even when I shoot a nine, I'm only thinking about how I can convert that into a 10 on the next shot.\"\n\nShe's now well on the way to conquer a sport she had felt was \"impossible,\" because \"My legs used to ache a lot\" and it's because of that I-can-do-anything attitude of hers. \"I believe that no one has any limitations, it's just about wanting something enough and working as hard as you can. If I can do it, anyone else can.\"\n\nThis is backed by her mentor. Stutzman has said about her that \"her drive to win is incredible. She listens, she's motivated and she has the same spark [he had initially]\". He recently called her \"the future of the sport\".\n\nYou can see why, clearly. While Stutzman is the pioneering legend, it's Sheetal that has become a sensation, the one has brought the world's focus onto the sport of para-archery. Every once in a while, you get an athlete who takes up a position in popular culture that's often bigger than their sport itself, and that's where Sheetal finds herself right now. On the face of it, Sheetal seems strong enough to handle all that attention. After all, she shrugged off the disappointment of a pre-quarters' loss (the match from which the clip went viral, a match where she showed all the nerves a 17-year-old debutant at the world's biggest stage is expected to) to bring her A-game to the mixed event just two days later. That's mental toughness of the highest order. She'll continue to need it as her career takes off from here.\n\nHer fame continues to skyrocket, and this medal will only add to it. She's so popular now that she seems to have become the unofficial face of the Paralympic Games for the casual viewer.... And why not? The Paralympics is an event that celebrates the impossible being done in the face of odds that most of us can barely comprehend, one that celebrates finding sporting excellence in people who were ignored as incapable of producing it. Who captures that spirit of this event, that true meaning of these Games better than this 'armless' archer from Jammu?",

    "raw_text": "Two leagues will be rewarded with an extra place in next season's UEFA Champions League (UCL) based on performance in Europe this season.\n\nLast season, Borussia Dortmund of the German Bundesliga and Bologna from Italian Serie A were the lucky recipients, with clubs in Germany and Italy outperforming those from England, France and Spain.\n\nNow the league phase has been completed in the UCL, UEFA Europa League (UEL) and UEFA Conference League (UCoL) we're starting to get a clearer picture of the race this year.\n\nThe English Premier League is in a very dominant position but we're a long way from finding out who will get the two spots.\n\nHere's how it works, and where all the leagues stand.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIt's about the collective performance of all teams from each country taking part in Europe this season. The two leagues with the best average coefficient scores get an extra place.\n\nRegardless of competition, each win is worth two coefficient points, a draw gets you one point, and you get nothing for a defeat.\n\nIf a match goes to extra time, the score after 120 minutes is used. Penalties are not taken into account if the game is drawn, as they are used to determine the tie rather than the individual match.\n\nThe points gained by all clubs are added together, and that total score is divided by the number of clubs a country has in Europe in the season. That gives the coefficient average. For example, if a country has 60 coefficient points and seven teams in Europe, its score is 8.571 for the table (60 / 7).\n\nThe additional place goes to the first team in the league table outside the UCL places. So, in the Premier League it would go to fifth. It's a place on top of the regular allocation, so if a league usually has seven places in Europe, it will have eight next season.\n\nSo wins aren't worth more in the Champions League?\n\nNo, the coefficient system is essentially designed to assess the overall strength of leagues. Wins are the same in all competitions. Otherwise, it would be impossible for those leagues with few or no teams in the UCL group stage to move up the coefficient rankings.\n\nHowever, clubs in the UCoL do play two fewer games in the league phase.\n\nWhat about the new bonus points system?\n\nThis is where things changed, and performance in the UCL became much more valuable than the UEL, and likewise the UCoL.\n\nUnder the old system, the maximum bonus points for a club in the UCL was 12, and now it's 18 (+6). In the UEL it's up from eight to 10 (+2). In the UCoL, it has risen from four to six (+2).\n\nIn addition, every club that participates in the UCL gets a minimum of six bonus points just for taking part (up from four). In the UEL, you have to finish first to get six bonus points. In the UCoL, first place only gets you four points. There are no bonus in the UEL or UCoL if you finish outside the top 24.\n\nThere are then bonus points for reaching each of the knockout rounds, again weighted by competition.\n\nAs well as those high bonus points in the UCL for position, the teams who finish in the top eight of each league are guaranteed another 1.500 for reaching the round of 16.\n\nThere are no bonus points for participating in the knockout playoffs in February in any of the competitions, but you do get points for the result of each leg which isn't available to the top eight. Results in the knockout playoffs count to the league's overall coefficient, but not the club's.\n\nFor instance, by winning the UCL league phase Liverpool have earned 13.500 bonus points -- 12.000 for first place, and another 1.500 for getting to the round of 16. Arsenal have added 13.000 bonus points for finishing third. Aston Villa, in eighth, have added 11.750 while Man City, who were 22nd, could only supply 6.750 bonus points.\n\nManchester United (6.500) and Tottenham Hotspur (6.250) picked up much fewer bonus points in the UEL even though they finished third and fourth.\n\nBy comparison, Chelsea got only 4.500 bonus points even though they finished first in the UCoL and made the round of 16.\n\nSo that's an advantage for the leagues with five UCL teams?\n\nYes, and no.\n\nWhile Serie A and the Bundesliga have five teams in the Champions League, they also have eight teams in Europe.\n\nEvery win and bonus point is, when averaged, worth less than it is for the other leagues. And if a few teams struggle, there's no chance of challenging for the top two.\n\nItalian clubs are holding up well, but German teams have unperformed greatly and appear to have little chance of holding onto a fifth place.\n\nWon't this just turn out to be extra places for two top leagues?\n\nThe new bonus-points system gives a bigger advantage to leagues with more teams in the UCL.\n\nIf we look back at the previous six seasons, England and Spain take seven of the 12 slots, with Italy and Germany two each. Only in 2021-22 did one of the countries with fewer than four teams in the Champions League (the Netherlands) finish in the top two of average coefficient.\n\nHistory already told us that it's highly likely two of the top leagues will have five places in the Champions League. Now that's been strengthened by the extra bonus points in the UCL.\n\n2023-24: Italy and Germany\n\n2022-23: England and Italy\n\n2021-22: England and the Netherlands\n\n2020-21: England and Spain\n\n2019-20: Spain and Germany\n\n2018-19: England and Spain\n\nHow did the Champions League play out?\n\nEngland and France are the only two leagues who still have all four participants active going into the knockout rounds.\n\nItaly effectively lost their extra team, with Bologna eliminated.\n\nBut it was worse for Germany, with the Bundesliga losing VfB Stuttgart and RB Leipzig.\n\nSpain will be without Girona in the knockout rounds.\n\nHow did the Europa League play out?\n\nEngland is the only league to have both teams direct to the round of 16.\n\nSpain and Italy have both teams through, though one from each will be in the knockout playoff round.\n\nIt's bad news for Germany and France, who had one team in the top eight but the other was eliminated.\n\nHow did the Conference League play out?\n\nNot such good news for France, as Lens failed to qualify for the league phase and that left Ligue 1's hopes of challenging for the extra UCL places in tatters.\n\nBut all teams from the Premier League, LaLiga, Serie A and the Bundesliga are into the knockouts.\n\nChelsea won all six of their matches and finished in first place, which gave them maximum points towards the Premier League score. Fiorentina joined Chelsea in going directly through to the round of 16.\n\nPortugal's Guimaraes finished second, which has helped the Primeira Liga into contention. Belgium have two teams through, with Cercle Brugge automatically into the round of 16 and Gent in the playoff round.\n\nThere is the potential for a round of 16 meeting between Chelsea and knockout playoff round participants Real Betis (LaLiga) or 1. FC Heidenheim (Bundesliga), which would create a head-to-head battle for coefficient points as well as progress in the UCoL.\n\nHow does the coefficient table look this season?\n\nThis is the top 10 as of Jan. 30.\n\n1. England, 20.892 - 7/7\n\n2. Italy, 17.312 - 7/8\n\n3. Spain, 17.178 - 6/7\n\n4. Portugal, 14.750 - 4/5\n\n5. Germany, 14.671 - 5/8\n\n6. France, 13.928 - 5/7\n\n7. Belgium, 13.150 - 5/5\n\n8. Netherlands, 11.916 - 5/6\n\n9. Greece, 11.062 - 3/4\n\n10. Sweden, 10.125 - 1/4\n\nThe brackets indicate how many of a league's original allocation are still active. For instance, 6/7 indicates one of a league's seven teams has been knocked out.\n\nSo, how is the race looking after the league phase?\n\nEngland are in a position of incredible strength. Of their seven remaining teams, six are straight through to the round of 16. Only Manchester City (who will have to take on Real Madrid or Bayern Munich) are in the playoff round.\n\nBut Italy and Spain are neck and neck in second. And, as we saw last season, a bad round for Premier League teams could yet change everything.\n\nItaly has lost Bologna, while four of its remaining teams must play in the knockout playoff round. Spain has three teams in the playoffs, so it's very tight between these leagues.\n\nCould any other league mount a serious challenge? It's doubtful from here.\n\nWe can probably forget about Germany, with three clubs already eliminated. France have lost two and there's a guaranteed all-French tie in the next round of the Champions League, so that will become three.\n\nWhile Portugal and Belgium have multiple teams left, and score more average points per win, there's a lot of work to do to make up the ground to the top 2.\n\nRight now, it looks like a three-horse race for two places.\n\nWhen do we usually find out who gets the extra places?\n\nIn many seasons it can be obvious in March, once we know which leagues have multiple teams through to the quarterfinals of the three European competitions. But it's likely to be later before there's final confirmation.\n\nLast season, Serie A clinched an extra berth on April 18, with the Bundesliga following on May 1.\n\nIt looked like it was going to be closer, but terrible results for English clubs in the quarterfinals, losing four of its five remaining teams, effectively handed second place to Germany.\n\nThe way the Premier League is going, it might be earlier this time.\n\nHowever, the 2019-20 season shows that it can go right down to the wire. Germany didn't overtake the Premier League for second place until Bayern Munich beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in the final of the Champions League. If that's repeated this season, we wouldn't know which league gets the second additional spot until the UCL final on May 31.\n\nIt would leave two clubs in the domestic leagues praying for the right result in the final. In 2019-20, Bayer Leverkusen and Leicester City finished fifth in Germany and England respectively. Leverkusen would have needed Bayern to win the UCL final to get the place, while Leicester required Bayern to lose the match.\n\nWhat's the maximum number of places in the UCL and in Europe?\n\nUnder the old system, a maximum of five clubs from one association could play in the Champions League. The cap has been removed and it will be possible for seven teams to get a place in the UCL: The top four, fifth through league performance in Europe, and the winners of the UCL and the UEL (if they do not finish in the top four).\n\nIt would also technically be possible, though highly unlikely, to have 11 teams in Europe: The usual allocation of seven, plus the extra Champions League place and the titleholders of all three European competitions.\n\nHow does the extra place affect the other league positions?\n\nIf we assume the extra spots will go to one of the top leagues, it means fifth place will enter the Champions League and it will have eight (rather than seven) places in Europe. Other European berths drop down a place.\n\nAny season the Premier League gets it, the access will be:\n\nChampions League: 1-5\n\nEuropa League: 6, FA Cup winners\n\nConference League: Carabao Cup winners\n\nIf LaLiga, the Bundesliga or Serie A get it, the access will be:\n\nChampions League: 1-5\n\nEuropa League: 6, Cup winners\n\nConference League: 7\n\nIn all cases if a team win the domestic cup and finish in a European place in the league, the spots drop down one more place.\n\nIf a team win the UEL or UCL but don't qualify for the UCL domestically, that league would have six places in the UCL -- the five places to the leagues plus the UEL or UCL titleholders as an additional. The league would forfeit the domestic place earned by the titleholders.\n\nLast season, if Borussia Dortmund had won the Champions League, Germany would have had six teams (the top six) in the UCL but only one in the UEL -- losing the spot earned by Dortmund.\n\nIf a country gets the performance spot, and one of its teams finishes eighth and wins a European trophy, ninth can get a place in the UCoL.\n\nWhich teams would benefit right now?",

    "raw_text": "Fourteen members of the figure skating community were passengers on an American Airlines jet that collided with an Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport and crashed into the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, according to Skating Club of Boston executive director Doug Zeghibe.\n\nThe flight carried 60 passengers and four crew members, while an Army official said three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.\n\nWashington fire chief John Donnelly said Thursday morning that it is not believed that there were any survivors and that efforts had shifted to a recovery operation.\n\nZeghibe said six members or associates of the Skating Club of Boston were killed in the crash, including teenage skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane. Their mothers, Jin Han and Christine Lane, as well as their coaches Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov were also killed.\n\nHan and Lane, who was about 16, were returning from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.\n\n\"We watched Jinna just grow up here from just a tiny little tyke into this amazingly mature 13-year-old,\" Zeghibe said. \"A great performer, a great competitor, and off the ice, a great kid.\"\n\nAlso killed were Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won the pairs title at the 1994 world championships and competed twice in the Olympics. They were listed as coaching at the Boston club.\n\n\"Skating is a very close and tight-knit community. These kids and their parents, they're here at our facility in Norwood, six, sometimes seven days a week. It's a close, tight bond,\" Zeghibe said. \"This will have long-reaching impacts for our skating community.\"\n\nAlexandr Kirsanov and two youth ice skaters whom he coached were on board the flight, Kirsanov's wife, Natalya Gudin, told ABC News.\n\nThe Philadelphia Skating Club & Humane Society said in a post on social media that \"beloved members\" of its team were on the plane. The group did not say how many members were on the plane. Additionally, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission announced that 12-year-old youth figure skater Olivia Ter was also on board.\n\nU.S. Figure Skating said the skaters were returning from a developmental camp that followed the U.S. Figure Skating Championships over the weekend in Wichita, Kansas.\n\n\"U.S. Figure Skating can confirm that several members of our skating community were sadly aboard American Airlines Flight 5342, which collided with a helicopter yesterday evening in Washington, D.C.,\" the organization said in a statement. \"We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts.\"\n\nThe airplane collided with the helicopter while attempting to land, prompting a large search-and-rescue operation in the Potomac River. Donnelly said 27 bodies had been recovered from the airplane as of Thursday morning, and all three soldiers who were on the helicopter have been recovered, officials said.\n\nLane was the 2025 intermediate Eastern Sectionals champion and had become popular among the skating community on social media, where he has thousands of TikTok followers. On Wednesday, he had posted a video showing him doing a triple toe loop to wrap up the development camp and later posted a photo of himself aboard the plane just before it departed from Wichita.\n\nGudin, who is also an ice skating coach, decided to stay home in Delaware while Kirsanov flew to Kansas for the development camp. She spoke with her husband as he boarded the flight Wednesday and said she has \"lost everything.\"\n\n\"I lost my husband, I lost my students, I lost my friends,\" Gudin told ABC News. \"I need my husband back. I need his body back.\"\n\nU.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland said her organization was \"devastated\" by the crash.\n\n\"Among those lost were talented athletes, dedicated coaches, and beloved family members from the U.S. Figure Skating community, all returning home from the National Development Camp,\" Hirshland said in a statement. \"These Olympic hopefuls represented the bright future of Team USA, embodying the very essence of what it means to represent our country -- perseverance, resilience, and hope. They were remarkable young people and talents, passionately pursuing their dreams, and they will forever hold a cherished place in the Team USA family.\"\n\nShishkova and Naumov had been coaching at the Boston club since 2017. Their son, Maxim Naumov, is a competitive figure skater for the U.S. who finished fourth at the U.S. championships. He had flown home Monday with Zeghibe.\n\nRussia's figure skating federation expressed its condolences to those who had lost loved ones in the crash but said it was unable to comment further.\n\n\"There were other of our fellow citizens there. Bad news from Washington today,\" Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday morning.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said the midair crash occurred before 9 p.m. ET when a regional jet from Wichita was making its approach to an airport runway and collided with a military helicopter on a training flight.\n\nThere was no immediate word on the cause of the collision, but officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet coming from Wichita was making a routine landing when the helicopter flew into its path. All takeoffs and landings at Reagan National were halted as dive teams scoured the site and helicopters from law enforcement agencies across the region flew over the scene in a methodical search for bodies. Flights resumed at Reagan National at 11 a.m. Thursday.\n\nImages from the river showed boats around the partly submerged wing and what appeared to be the mangled wreckage of the plane's fuselage.\n\n\"As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly,\" President Donald Trump said at a news conference Thursday, adding, \"We'll find out how this disaster occurred and will ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.\"\n\nThe Skating Club of Boston, which is set to host the world championships in March, is among the best-known clubs in the world, producing numerous Olympic and world champions. Among them have been two-time Olympic champion Dick Button, Olympic gold medalist Tenley Albright, two-time Olympic medalist Nancy Kerrigan and Olympic silver medalist Paul Wylie. The club sent 18 skaters to Wichita, including Jimmy Ma, who finished fifth at the U.S. championships on Sunday, and Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov, who won the pairs title.\n\nZeghibe said the club was proceeding with plans to host worlds.\n\n\"Skaters are resilient, and they want to skate. I think also they come to the club and will come to the club as an opportunity to come together and to grieve together,\" Zeghibe said. \"We're pretty busy and we can't take a break. We need to keep moving.\"\n\nThe International Skating Union said it was \"deeply shocked by the tragic accident.\"\n\n\"We are heartbroken to learn that figure skaters, along with their families, friends, and coaches, are understood to be among those on board,\" the global governing body said in a statement. \"Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy. Figure skating is more than a sport -- it's a close-knit family -- and we stand together. We remain in close contact with U.S. Figure Skating and offer our full support during this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nThe crash occurred in some of the most tightly controlled and monitored airspace in the world, just over 3 miles south of the White House and the Capitol.\n\nInvestigators will try to piece together the aircrafts' final moments before their collision, including contact with air traffic controllers and the loss of altitude by the passenger jet.\n\nLess than 30 seconds before the crash, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter if it had the arriving plane in sight. The controller made another radio call to the helicopter moments later: \"PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.\" Seconds after that, the two aircraft collided.\n\nSome 300 first responders were on scene. Inflatable rescue boats were launched into the Potomac River from a point along the George Washington Parkway, just north of the airport, and first responders set up light towers from the shore to illuminate the area near the collision site. At least a half dozen boats were scanning the water using searchlights.\n\nThis is not the first time that the U.S. figure skating community has been rocked by an air tragedy. In February 1961, the 18-member U.S. figure skating team died in a plane crash en route to the world championships in Prague. Also killed were six U.S. coaches and four skating officials, along with some family members. The world championships were canceled that year out of respect for the American team killed in the crash.\n\n\"Almost half of everybody on board that plane were from this club,\" Zeghibe said of the 1961 crash. \"It had long, long-reaching implications for the skating club and for the sport in this country, because when you lose coaches like this, you lose the future of the sport as well. It's been a long time in redeveloping it, and I personally feel that this club in Boston has just now, almost 60 years later, been coming out of the shadow of that 1961 crash.\"\n\nWednesday's collision also recalled the crash of an Air Florida flight that plummeted into the Potomac on Jan. 13, 1982, and killed 78 people.\n\nThe Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.",

    "raw_text": "Consistency leads to success. Ask Puneri Paltan, who won 19/24 matches to lift the Pro Kabaddi League [PKL 10] title on Friday. In a hotly-contested final against Haryana Steelers, Puneri Paltan authoritatively confirmed their status as the best PKL team of all time, snatching a 28-25 triumph.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the 18th minute that Puneri Paltan even had a lead to hold on to. Both sides got off to cagey starts and the men in orange just about led by two points. And then came a 12-second sequence that would change the game.\n\nPankaj Mohite runs from the right to the left of the mat, fakes a kick to tease Jaideep Dahiya into making a tackle. Jaideep bites the bait and leaps ahead in a desperate attempt to stop Pankaj with a double thigh hold. Such was Pankaj's momentum that by the time Jaideep grabbed his left leg, the Puneri Paltan raider was one full stretch away from the midline.\n\nBut it wasn't that easy. Things got tricky because, from the corner of his eye, Pankaj had seen that support was coming in for Jaideep. He needed to get out of this quickly, and effectively. He thrust himself forward using his elbow but before he could cross the line, Mohit, Rahul Sethpal and Vinay were onto him.\n\nThe three muscular men put their combined bodyweight of 200+ kgs on Pankaj, who was still dealing with Jaideep grappling his feet. While the four-man defence took care of Pankaj's body, they paid no heed to his dangling hand. His left hand, sporting a bicep with bulging veins, lingered in the air before swiping past the white line and the rest was history.\n\nThe Puneri Paltan bench rejoiced and the Haryana Steelers looked on in disbelief. They simply could not believe it. Manpreet Singh, Haryana Steelers' coach, could not believe that the PKL title was about to slip away for a third time. The Haryana Steelers asked for a review and contested that he had only two points, but all the review did was give everyone another chance to marvel at this jaw-dropping raid.\n\nIt was the kind of raid that could change the course of a match, let alone a final. It was the kind of raid that will be remembered for ages, one that would go on to lead Puneri Paltan to their first PKL title.\n\nIt led to four humongous points for Puneri Paltan and more than half of the Haryana Steelers squad woefully trudged off the mat. And how did Pankaj celebrate it? Well, he did not. He simply walked back to his side of the mat to hugs from his teammates. And that tells you how this team plays their kabaddi: there's no individual greed or milestone-hunting. Each of them plays for the orange on their jerseys. For the team and by the team.\n\nIt's also what Mohammadreza Shadloui, Puneri Paltan's superhuman left corner said before the game. He finishes PKL 10 with 99 tackle points, one short of the century mark and two short of a record for most tackle points in a season. \"I am not thinking about 100 tackle points. I am thinking first about winning the trophy. If I break the record, then I'll be happy. If not [it's okay], I don't care about records.\"\n\nRoughly an hour after his game-changing raid, Pankaj was hoisted by his teammates as Puneri Paltan were declared the champions. Captain Aslam Inamdar was sat atop a dhol and coach BC Ramesh was also hoisted as the players danced to the beats of the drums. They finally had a chance to dance, after making opponents dance to their tunes all season long.",

    "raw_text": "After the conclusion of the Women's Hockey India League last week, a 24-member India (W) squad was named for the upcoming FIH Pro League games in Bhubaneswar. Positively, there were a bunch of new names who made it to the squad and the reserve list based on their impressive performances in the league.\n\nThis was good news because one of the aims of the women's HIL was to provide opportunities and develop the next generation of Indian hockey players. At the same time, there were also the names of Vandana Katariya and Sushila Chanu -- two Indian hockey veterans who have played for India for more than a decade. At the WHIL, both 32-year-olds -playing for the Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers team - showed no signs of slowing down.\n\nIn the WHIL, Vandana and Sushila did what they have been doing for more than a decade -- giving their all on the pitch. The Bengal Tigers didn't make it to the final, but the two veterans led by example. Sushila, playing at the back, was outstanding with her defending while also initiating attacks for her team. Vandana showed her attacking prowess with non-stop running and creating chances for her teammates. Their work on the pitch may not be the most eye-catching but watching the two play is a lesson for youngsters on hard work, commitment and longevity.\n\nSpeaking to ESPN India in Ranchi, both Vandana and Sushila said WHIL is needed to generate more young talents in the country but also reiterated their desire to play more.\n\n\"My mindset is to play more. I don't know what will happen in future, the upcoming players are playing at the highest level. I am not thinking much, at present I want to continue playing,\" says Vandana. Sushila is also vocal about her target. \"My target is the next Olympics, my dream is to win a gold medal at the Asian Games. The youngsters are doing good, but we have to do more. If they are at level five, we want to be at level eight,\" says Sushila.\n\nThe likes of Sonam, Rutuja Dadaso Pisal, Sakshi Rana, Jyoti, and Akshata Abaso Dhekale have made it to the senior squad based on their performances in the WHIL. They will push their case to be India's future. While competing for their place, they will also want to learn from Vandana and Sushila. Fitness and honest mentality are the two defining qualities of the two long-serving Indian players.\n\n\"For me, it's important to be in the present moment. First and foremost, you have to keep yourself fit. You're playing at the highest level because you're physically fit and that's why you need to take care of fitness, including the diet. If I do it, then others will see and take inspiration,\" says Vandana when asked about her secret to success.\n\n\"For me, honesty is most important. You need to be honest to yourself. You need to be honest and dedicated in the training sessions. We have to do it with honesty. It's because of this I have played for so long,\" says Sushila.\n\nEven now, when Vandana sprints with the ball, the best of foreign defenders fail to catch her. For Sushila, the fact that she overcame two career-threatening knee injuries, showed her elite mentality. The best part is that the two players have taken inspiration from each other. They first met back in 2010 at the SAI centre of excellence in Bhopal. Since then, their relationship blossomed from being fierce competitors to a close friendship.\n\n\"Fitness ke liye uska paagalpan hai (she's mad about fitness.) I've learnt it from her. Sometimes, when I don't feel like it, no matter who tells me, I won't do it. But I learned from Vandana that you need to do it. You need to put in the time no matter what,\" says Sushila.\n\nVandana also points out how Sushila bounced back not once but twice from injuries, both physically and mentally. \"Not only me but the whole team has taken inspiration from how she tackled two knee surgeries and made her comeback. It takes a lot to become mentally stronger and get back on the field. And to maintain the same tempo as a player while also helping others on the field. When I need motivation, I speak to her,\" says Vandana.\n\nThe Indian women's hockey team have started a new journey towards the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics. After missing qualification for the Paris Olympics, the pressure is on the team to turn it around and get the train back on track. The start of WHIL is an important step in that direction and soon players will find themselves vying for the veterans' spot in the team.\n\nVandana's effectiveness in front of goal will not be the same and Sushila will face competition from somebody like Jyoti, who was named WHIL Player of the Tournament.\n\nThe truth is that even though they don't want to stop soon, Vandana and Sushila might not make it to LA 2028. But what's important is that the younger players need to imbibe the best qualities of their two seniors. To become top professionals, to play for decades and to be effective on the pitch, they don't have to look far. They have Vandana and Sushila.",

    "raw_text": "After years of waiting, the Hockey India League is restarting again on December 28. The men's league will begin first and later the four women's teams will be in action. A few of the world's best players will be missing the season, despite getting picked in the auction, but there's plenty of quality among the teams, including the best from India.\n\nAhead of the opening match between Team Gonasika and Delhi SG Pipers, here's all you need to know about the league:\n\nDates for men's and women's HIL\n\nThe men's league will begin on December 28 and the final is scheduled on February 1.\n\nThe women's league will start on January 12 and the final is on January 26.\n\nTeams\n\nEight teams will compete in the men's league: Delhi SG Pipers, Hyderabad Toofans, Vedanta Kalinga Landers, Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers, Soorma Hockey Club (Punjab), Tamil Nadu Dragons, Team Gonasika Vizag and UP Yudras.\n\nHockey India League (men's), meet the teams: Best player, coach, full squad, predictions\n\nThe four women's teams are: Delhi SG Pipers, Odisha Warriors, Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers and Soorma Hockey Club (Haryana).\n\nLocations\n\nThe women's matches (except for two) and the final will take place in Ranchi. The men's matches (except for four) and the final will take place in Rourkela.\n\nWhy's there no home and away?\n\nWell, to keep costs low and avoid logistics issues, Hockey India took the decision to restrict the league to just two locations. However, the good news is that all the franchises are keen to switch to home and format soon. Hopefully, by next year.\n\nWhy did the previous avatar of the HIL stop?\n\nThe previous avatar ran for five years, from 2013 to 2017. However, high costs and a packed international calendar proved to be major issues. While franchises struggled to make money, lack of a proper window for the tournament also played a role with the introduction of the FIH Pro League.\n\nNow, there's a dedicated window for the league and the owners insist they are in for a long haul.\n\nHockey India League returns, franchises brace for 'exciting challenge', 'long haul'\n\nWhat's the format?\n\nIn phase one of the men's league, each team will play the other once.\n\nAfter seven matches for each team, phase two will begin where each team will play their opponents from the same pool. For phase two, pool A has Delhi SG Pipers, Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers, Soorma Hockey Club and Vedanta Kalinga Lancers. Pool B has Team Gonasika, Hyderabad Toofans, Tamil Nadu Dragons and UP Rudras.\n\nAfter phase one and two, the top four teams, in terms of points, will make it to the semifinals.\n\nFor the women's league, it's simpler. Four teams will play each other twice and the top two will make it to the final.\n\nWho are players (in men's league) to watch out for?\n\nAll the best Indian players, including Harmanpreet Singh, Abhishek, Hardik Singh, Manpreet Singh will feature but it will be interesting to see the youngsters rising up to the challenge and attempting to seize the spotlight. The likes of Ankit Pal, Rohit, Arshdeep Singh, Manmeet Singh and Thounaojam Ingalemba Luwang are part of the junior team setup and went for good money at the auction. It will also be interesting to see the performance of players on the other end of the experience scale, with the likes of Rupinder Pal Singh (Shrachi) and SV Sunil (Team Gonasika) key figures for their respective teams.\n\nWho are key foreign players to watch out for?\n\nThere are quite a few big names despite the multiple withdrawals. Germany's Gonzalo Peillat (Hyderabad Toofans), England's Zach Wallace (Hyderabad Toofans), Belgium's Alexander Hendrickx (Kalinga Lancers), Netherlands' Jip Janssen (Tamil Nadu Dragons) Oliver Payne (Team Gonasika) and Australia's Jeremy Hayward (Soorma) and Blake Govers (Tamil Nadu Dragons) are definitely names to keep an eye on.\n\nBroadcast details\n\nThe tournament will be shown on DD Sports and Sony Sports Network. The matches can also be streamed LIVE on OTT app Waves.",

    "raw_text": "Ramona Shelburne's remarkable Kobe Bryant profile was published in the days after the Hall of Famer closed out his career with an unbelievable 60-point night. In this story behind the story, Shelburne explains how the piece was re-imagined in the wake of Bryant's dramatic last effort.\n\nHe's been planning his basketball death for years now. Scripting it down to his final words.\n\nMamba Out.\n\nOf course T-shirts with that phrase were available to buy on his website within minutes of his final speech to the crowd at Staples Center. He saw all of this coming.\n\nKobe Bryant has been living as a legend for 20 years now. He sure as hell was going to die as one.\n\nNot that he isn't deep into what comes next. For the past few years, he's been saying he wanted to be a storyteller after he finished with basketball but keeping the details sparse and cryptic. He'd allude to conversations he was having with creative types such as J.K. Rowling or J.J. Abrams but never say how deep they went.\n\n\"There's an entire mythological universe I've created,\" he finally reveals. \"There are certain rules that make up this world. Within this world, I've built in a lot of room for really talented writers to come in.\n\n\"The bulk of it's coming from me. But the writers being phenomenal at what they do are able to really bring my imagination to life.\"\n\nThere's the obvious swipe at the narcissism that's made him at least as famous as his scoring. Of course Kobe has moved into a world of his own making. The only surprise is that he'd pass the vision to a group of writers and trust that they'd execute it better than he could.\n\n\"I think Walt did this with animation, as well,\" he says. Yes, he's referring to Walt Disney. \"He quickly realized that, although he could draw pretty well, there are other animators out there that are just much, much better. He went and found those animators and gave them the vision and allowed them to do what they do best. If you collaborate with great people and each one is enhancing the other, that's when we create things that are timeless.\"\n\nTHE CROWD OUTSIDE Staples Center started gathering around 10 a.m. on the day of his final game. It was as big of a Lakers crowd as I'd seen since their last championship parade. The man had played 20 years in this city. He'd become a frame of reference. I had this line from J.R. Moehringer's story on Derek Jeter as I wrote. It was about how Jeter had become \"good company\" for New Yorkers, the longer he played for the Yankees.\n\nI don't know that anyone would ever describe Kobe as \"good company,\" but he certainly was a hell of a presence for this city to have in its life for two decades.\n\nAnyway, toward the middle of the third quarter, you could feel the crowd growing nostalgic. After a long farewell, this really was goodbye. But then something crazy happened. Kobe started making everything. He hit 40 points, then 50 ... The crowd didn't have time to choke back tears. Everyone was cheering and screaming too loud. This couldn't be happening.\n\nIt was audacious. Kobe freaking Bryant went for 60 points in his final game. Even more audacious, he shot the ball 50 times. For a guy who spent his entire career being criticized for shooting too much, this was like flipping the bird to everyone on the way out.\n\nI called my editor Raina Kelley after the game in a fit. What in the hell were we going to do with the story now? I remember her saying something like, \"He just unbalanced the story.\" Actually, I remember both of us dropping many four-letter words, knowing we'd have to reframe and rewrite what was essentially a polished draft.\n\nI sent Kobe an email after the game asking what the hell had just happened. He was still shocked by it, too, and we went back and forth with emails until about 3:30 a.m.\n\nI asked if we could talk the next day so we could try to find some perspective on it. We ended up speaking for about 45 minutes. I think he was still trying to make sense of it.\n\nMy plan was pretty simple: Ask him about what comes next. Life after this basketball death. I was shocked to find out just how deep into his new life he already was.\n\nThe thing that fascinated me the most was how much about the day after Kobe had already planned out. He was determined to stay on track. On schedule. On script. I don't know if this was a protective thing. As if he knew this moment would be emotional, so he scheduled how to deal with it in advance. Or if he just wasn't emotional about it at all.\n\nWhat was clear to me was that he'd been thinking about this day and what he wanted it to be for a long time.",

    "raw_text": "Heading into the 2016 Rio Olympics, you wrote about the depression Allison Schmitt experienced after the 2012 London Games, and what she has done to seek help and eventually share her story. How do you approach the reporting for such an intensely personal and challenging subject like an athlete's mental health?\n\nI've wanted to write about post-Olympic depression for a long time. Athletes reference it a lot, and there are stories about it around every Games, but I found most of those pieces dealt in generalities and were very predictable. The suicides of Olympic athletes I've covered have made me heartsick. I wanted to drill deep into one athlete's story in a way that could touch others.\n\nI didn't know much about Allison except that she'd won a bunch of medals at London 2012 and trained with Michael Phelps. I'd been around her only in large group situations where she always seemed guarded. I was very surprised at the content of the initial interviews she did with the Associated Press and The Baltimore Sun in the spring-summer of 2015, after her cousin's suicide. I covered the Pan American Games in Toronto that July and watched her demeanor on the pool deck. She seemed more open.\n\nSometimes I go on pure intuition when I approach someone to be a central figure in a story, and this was one of those times. I spoke to Allison briefly at Pan Ams, and made her agency, Octagon, aware of what I wanted to do. Then I arranged a casual meeting alone with her at USA Swimming's annual awards dinner in November (where she received an award for her advocacy). We spent about 15 or 20 minutes together, and I was very clear about what I had in mind: I wanted to go beyond where she had gone in other interviews and would ask her to revisit some painful times in detail. I also told her I'd like to see her in a couple of different environments over the next few months, and talked about timing for posting the story. I think that transparency helped me build trust with Allison. She was fully on board from the start.\n\nI also was able to introduce myself to Allison's father, Ralph, and her aunt, Amy Bocian, at that dinner. Having the family's confidence and commitment was crucial. I spent time with Ralph and Gail Schmitt and their oldest daughter Kirsten at home in Michigan in February 2016. On that same visit, Allison made an appearance before a large gathering of high school athletes. Her words that day were raw and moving.\n\nAllison and I sat down one-on-one in Arizona (her training base) in mid-April. It was as intense an interview as I've ever done, but we were both ready. She went straight to some of the most difficult parts of her journey. Shortly afterward, I spent an evening with Amy and Tim Bocian at their home in the Pittsburgh area. I re-interviewed Amy and Allison at the Olympic trials in Omaha. I can't say enough about the courage of everyone concerned to delve into some very rough topics.\n\nThe key to this reporting process -- a year from start to finish -- was that I had time to build slowly and not just start slinging intimate questions at people\n\nYou bring such empathy to your feature writing, and you're also adept at crafting sharp analysis off the news. How do you strike the balance between those impulses?\n\nI'm a very restless writer and one of the ways I keep myself happy is by roving between analysis, feature work and investigative reporting. They do overlap. Every great feature requires some basic investigative skills. Every great investigation requires the feature-y skill of getting people to open up. Both require good analysis, and good analysis requires good reporting. The biggest adaptation for me has been writing strong opinion on individuals and entities I cover. I was brought up old-school in journalism and conditioned not to do that because it can burn bridges. On the other hand, I'm at a point in my career where I feel as if I have a lot to offer in the way of cumulative observation.\n\nYou wrote about how some Olympians have had to wait for their medals while performance-enhancing drug cases are resolved. Where did that story begin and how did you see it unfold?\n\nI was searching for an original way to approach the impact of doping and the dysfunction in the current anti-doping bureaucracy. An Olympic medal is going to be in the first line of an athlete's resume and the first line of their obituary. For most of them, a medal, depending on the color of that medal, can have a significant economic impact. Yet the quasi-legal system often allows re-allocation of medals to get held up in the pipeline for years even when there's a doping bust at the competition. Re-testing is a great deterrent on paper, and it absolutely should be done, but there's no transparency about the way it's done -- which sports are tested, which nations, which athletes, when and why. By the time the rightful medalist gets \"upgraded,'' financial and emotional benefits have evaporated, the athlete who cheated has reaped the spoils, and there's no mechanism for compensation. Everyone keys on the podium ceremony. I knew these athletes' stories would be accessible both to people who follow doping issues closely and people who don't.\n\nThe foundation of the story had to be data-driven, and there was no accurate information clearinghouse or list of medals that had been stripped. I envisioned a user-friendly graphic that would give people, in one glance, an idea of how many athletes had been denied their moment. Investigations editor Chris Buckle worked with our research staff to make that happen. We started months before the piece ran, and it was incredibly labor-intensive. We picked the year 2000 as a starting point because that roughly corresponds with the founding of the World Anti-Doping Agency and the current system of anti-doping jurisprudence.\n\nI knew there were some strong personal stories out there that had visual storytelling potential as well, and that led to collaboration with Outside the Lines and my frequent reporting partner T.J. Quinn. He and producer Andy Lockett focused on two athletes -- Canadian cross-country skier Beckie Scott and American shot-putter Adam Nelson -- and I broadened the lens to others in my digital piece. It was important to me to include non-U.S. athletes in the story. I didn't want it to have a nationalistic tone, because there are plenty of American athletes who have been caught doping, sometimes years after the fact.\n\nI was happy with the piece. Unfortunately, I don't see a solution to this issue coming any time soon.\n\nYou have covered almost every sport and event around the world. What was the most challenging and why?\n\nThey all have their own challenges. The Olympics are exhausting, and the last two -- in Sochi and Rio -- had some arduous aspects, and the interview \"mixed zone'' is not an ideal workspace, but we get to sleep in the same bed every night. World Cups (and World Cup qualifiers) feature interesting travel and stadium situations. I once covered a qualifier in Jamaica where we were seated at a table on the track around the pitch with no electricity or monitors, and we would caucus after every shot or important sequence to decide what had happened. Fortunately it was a day game and we could go back to the hotel to write. I've covered the Tour de France 12 times - eight of those start to finish and four of them solo -- and nothing is as logistically difficult as driving yourself around a three-week bike race. Endurance sports as a whole are an interesting category because you cannot see everything that happens in a marathon or a triathlon or a bike race or a 10-kilometer open water swim, and you have to stitch together a lot of the narrative from various interviews afterwards. I've always liked that. No matter what the working conditions are, if you have strong relationships going in from your pre-reporting, and decent access, you can do your job.\n\nHow did covering the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings affect you?\n\nI was locked down in a hotel near the finish line for several hours and of course felt the same anxiety, horror and sorrow as anyone who was there. But on the day, that was mixed with my intense frustration that I couldn't get out and report from the street. I had to breathe, compose myself, think about what I COULD do from where I was and stay away from speculating on things I couldn't see, which is a pretty important lesson for any reporter. That initial experience drove me to find other ways to tell meaningful marathon-related stories for days, weeks, months and years afterwards. It also reconnected me with family in the area who were at the race and personally affected.\n\nI spent a lot of time in Boston earlier in my life. I still love the city and cherish my memories, but it's a place of reflection for me now in a way that it was not before. When I go back, I make a point of retracing my steps from race day and thinking about loss, generosity, heroism, achievement and gratitude.\n\nPlus-1: \"The best advice I ever got was _____________.\"\n\n\"Show me, don't tell me.'' I think of it nearly every time I write a longform piece.",

    "publish_date": null,
    "authors": [],
    "raw_text": "Irvin's comments set off a round of columns, with Outsports.com writing extensively about the topic. All the while, Beckham had been rumored to be dating model and actress Amber Rose, one of the first of many celebrities to whom he'd be linked. Giants coaches told him to be himself, to dance and attempt catches that nobody else would dare -- but not to lose his head. Instead, he muted himself. In the final game of the season against the Eagles, he caught only five passes for 54 yards.\n\nThe next year, the Giants promoted McAdoo to head coach, and he tried to give Beckham a support system, hiring former LSU assistant and Beckham confidant Adam Henry to coach wide receivers. It didn't completely work. One day in the offseason, players and staffers saw Beckham sobbing hysterically in the facility. They asked what was wrong. Odell's dog had died. Nobody knew what to do with someone who felt things so deeply and brought it all to an NFL workplace, not exactly a temple of sensitivity.\n\nThe next time Beckham faced Norman, who had by then joined the Redskins, he exploded after Manning threw a fourth-quarter interception, swung his helmet into the kicker's net, yelled at Henry and appeared to cry on the sideline during the game's final minutes, gifting social media a video nearly as viral as The Catch. Again, the Giants staff implored him to balance his famous joy and his infamous explosions. Again, Beckham responded with a flat performance the next week, catching three passes for 23 yards, brushing an official and drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Vikings. \"It's not a coincidence,\" a Giants coach at the time says now, that Odell would have a bad game after being told to tone it down. \"He needs the alter ego.\" Beckham told coaches in private that he was having trouble sleeping, and he told reporters in public that football was no longer fun. The Giants hired a psychologist named Jonathan Fader to be a resource for the players -- especially Beckham. Fader worked hard, but the players assumed he reported everything back to the coaches, even when he didn't. He could only get so far.\n\nBeckham dropped nine passes in 2016, including the postseason, third most in the NFL. He took part in a quick boat getaway in Miami six days before the Giants' playoff matchup against the Packers, setting off a week of headlines and drama. You can get away with a lot in New York -- if you deliver when it counts. He didn't. He caught four passes, dropped two and reportedly punched a hole in the wall after the game. A few days before training camp in 2017, he sat for a three-minute YouTube video with Uninterrupted titled \"Odell Fears Falling Out of Love With Football,\" in which he both declared his desire to be the NFL's highest-paid player and said the game was \"starting to slowly become my job, not just what I love to do anymore.\"\n\nBeckham's 2017 season lasted five weeks before Chargers cornerback Casey Hayward landed on his ankle, fracturing it. At the time, he was leading the NFL with five drops. After a 3-13 season, Pat Shurmur was hired as the Giants' new coach. Then came the Paris video in March. The Giants privately questioned Beckham's reliability and maturity, and an NFL Network report surfaced that he would refuse to step onto a football field without a new contract. It was about to get ugly. He wanted some of the Hollywood life, with Drake, a life he feels is harmless and earned, and he also wanted to be the greatest and best-paid player in football. But the NFL will always make you choose. So after years of proving to be the exception to almost every rule, Odell did what all players eventually do: He got in line.\n\nHe's waking up. Odell has broken a sweat at his camp and is crouched a few yards from a line of kids. They run to him and try to juke him as he tries to gently swat balls out of their hands. He smiles at each kid who reaches the front of the line.\n\n\"You look like Steph Curry,\" Odell says to one.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the kid says back.\n\nThe kid makes a cut that catches him by surprise.\n\n\"Good move,\" Odell says.\n\nA little girl spins by him.\n\n\"Too fast,\" he says, shaking his head.\n\nThe day allows Odell to remember being a kid himself, when he attended Michael Vick's camp and saw a vision of what he might become -- an unprecedented force. You only get to be precocious once, only once feel the rush of others spotting something special in you. Eli Manning likes to tell a story from about a decade ago when he and Peyton were in New Orleans and asked Stewart if he had any high school receivers who could run routes for them. Odell did, and though his talent was raw, it was also unmistakable. Peyton whispered to Stewart, \"That kid's a little different,\" and being Peyton, he rigged the reps so he always threw to Odell and stuck Eli with lesser receivers. He knew what he was looking at.\n\nAt LSU, Beckham once told coaches he feared the day when football would become a job. The NFL delivered that day, as it always does. The question now is whether Beckham has it in him to grind until his spark is rekindled and then do it again when the spark goes out again, as it will, realizing that holding on to it is a job in itself.\n\nIn April, his mom, Heather, called an old friend, Caryl Smith Gilbert, the head track coach at USC, and asked if she'd work with her son. Smith Gilbert and Trojans sprinting coach Quincy Watts ran Beckham through a series of tests, mostly different kinds of jumps. The early results were troubling. \"His power in the first 10 yards wasn't as good as his power after 10 yards,\" Smith Gilbert says. They formulated a plan, filled with proprietary tests and data, and met three times a week for eight weeks. Beckham always showed up in a good mood -- \"cheering us up,\" Smith Gilbert says -- except on Wednesdays. Wednesdays were hill days in Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. To be at the park and stretched and ready to go by 6 a.m., he had to wake up around 4:45. \"We knew he'd be grouchy,\" Smith Gilbert says.\n\nBeckham had to sprint up hills, which were 75 meters long and inclined at about 65 degrees. Over six weeks, he had to complete 18 of them, three each Wednesday, with a two-minute rest in between. On Beckham's first hill, he failed to run full speed. \"Don't count,\" Watts said.\n\nBeckham glared at him. And glared. Watts wondered what would happen. Would Odell quit? Would he quit without officially quitting, giving a good effort but not his best on the next try? Seconds passed. Odell relinquished his glare, walked down the hill and sprinted up. He eventually found a way to do what he used to do: make the mundane fun. Over the next few weeks, it became a standing joke that he would accuse Watts of miscounting the number of hills he'd run. \"That's nine,\" Watts told him at one point.\n\n\"No, that's 10!\" he replied.\n\nAfter the hills, Beckham ran routes at USC or at UCLA. Every day, crowds formed, peeking over the fence, wondering whether it was really OBJ. A few videos of him running not home run deep routes with one hand but lunch pail short ones with two hands went viral in football circles. When Stewart watched them, it reminded him of the work that produced the high school touchdowns Odell now wanted -- needed -- to revisit.\n\nPat Shurmur sits in his office on a June afternoon, having just presided over his first minicamp. The burden of a coach's job is usually evident in his face, but in Shurmur's office, the burden literally hangs over his head. The only pictures on the wall behind him are team photos of the eight Giants championship squads, four from the pre-Super Bowl era and four since. The expectations are clear. Shurmur is pleased that Beckham wasn't traded -- Odell was part of this job's appeal -- and that the Giants decided to build around Eli Manning, at least for the next year or two. Earlier in the day at practice, Odell looked like the old Odell. He seemed to explode off the line. He caught balls with two hands and with one hand. He danced between reps to the music piped into practice, especially to \"What Is Love,\" and he would tell reporters two months later, \"I'm back in love with what I've always loved.\"\n\nShurmur knows that working with Beckham is both complex and simple. Trust will always supersede instruction. He reached out to him shortly after he got the job in January and tried to meet with him as much as possible. Beckham was in and out of the building, thanks to rehab, his contract uncertainty and his desire to be in LA. A mega-contract usually amplifies a player's habits rather than changing them. Nobody knows which habits Beckham will ultimately amplify. Shurmur leans back in his chair, and his eyes dart out his window overlooking the practice fields. \"Hold on a second,\" he says, and motions me to look.\n\n\"He's out there working with Eli,\" Shurmur says. \"Running full-speed routes, for whatever it's worth.\"\n\nShurmur has the championship expectations above him and two of the most important players in realizing them below him, working long after the rest of the players have called it a day. Eli will always play bland for the media, but he's an astute observer of talent and situation. In a weird way, he knows more about the next phase of Beckham's life than Beckham does. He's seen how fame rises and falls, a two-time Super Bowl MVP from an iconic football family who briefly lost game snaps last year to Geno Smith and practice reps to a rookie third-rounder named Davis Webb. Eli knows Beckham's life is unique and isn't, because he was on the throwing end of the David Tyree catch -- the greatest catch in NFL history before Beckham's. So it goes. There will always be a next moment, and there will always be a new guy, but there's also a reward if you can survive the first few years of adulation and money and pain. You accumulate scars, and the joy isn't as much innocent as it is earned, and you arrive at answers to questions you didn't even know to ask. The moving between worlds, from football to Hollywood or Madison Avenue, becomes easier. \"You get better with age in this league,\" Manning says.\n\nIn his office, Shurmur watches as Beckham runs a route I've never seen before, with more shifts and changes than seem logical before he explodes deep, a winding country road merging into a freeway. Beckham can evoke many emotions. He can make you love him, and he can make you love him a little less. But this much is clear: He can make you believe. I ask Shurmur what route Beckham just ran.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he says. He looks me in the eye, and the edges of his mouth curve just enough to betray his practiced caution as he says, \"Doesn't matter, does it?\"\n\nCamp is almost over, but there's a party waiting to explode. As BlocBoy JB's \"Shoot\" plays, Odell gathers hundreds of kids in a circle. The children have been jumpy and bouncy because after Odell came to life today, he became jumpy and bouncy, and like most people around him, when Odell dances, they dance. Friends sometimes greet him by dancing, a shared language. In July, he coached a celebrity soccer game in Hollywood, and the toddler daughter of one of his players, musician Teyana Taylor, started crying and pointing to the field. She wanted her mommy. Beckham picked her up, her lip quivering, tears on her face, and held her close and started dancing. Soon she rested her head on his chest and put her arm around his shoulder. She was happy. As any parent knows, he had pulled off a feat no less impressive than a one-handed catch.\n\nNow Odell leans in toward the kids at camp and on cue sings along with the song: \"Shhh -- don't make a sound.\" The circle explodes. The kids are dancing, and he is the middle. No other current NFL player could deliver this moment. When he later tells the campers that \"I'm a kid at heart, so I have the most fun when I'm out here with y'all,\" it's hard to believe he doesn't mean it. After a while, he slides out of the circle. The emcee says he has another commitment to tend to, the life of a pro athlete, the world these kids want. The music keeps playing as Odell climbs into a golf cart. He watches the kids with dyed blond hair dance and practice one-handed catches, his creation at work, as if hoping it all could last a little longer.",

She was elected from the Julana assembly constituency, which she contested as a candidate of the Congress party, by a margin of more than with 6,000 votes. After her win, Vinesh said: : \"This is the fight of every girl, every woman who chooses the path to fight. This is the victory of every struggle, of truth. I will maintain the love and trust that this country has given me.\n\n\"This was a people's battle, and they've won and I was just a face. I am thankful to all the love and respect that I've received.\"\n\nShe defeated, among others, the Bharatiya Janata Party's Captain Yogesh Bairagi, a former Army officer, the incumbent MLA and Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) candidate Amarjeet Dhanda, and also former professional wrestler Kavita Dalal from the Aam Aadmi Party.\n\nThis was the Congress's first win in Julana since 2005; the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) had won this seat from 2009 to 2019. Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia, who with Vinesh spearheaded the protest against former wrestling federation chief and ex-BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, was among the first to congratulate her. \"Many congratulations to the country's daughter Vinesh Phogat for her victory. This fight was not just for one Julana seat, it was not just with 3-4 other candidates, it was not just a fight between parties. This fight was against the strongest oppressive forces in the country. And Vinesh emerged victorious,\" he wrote on X.\n\nBefore the election result, Vinesh said she and her political party will fight for the rights of women and will focus on curbing unemployment in the state. Vinesh, who won multiple gold medals for India at the World Championships, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games, quit wrestling after her disqualification from the Paris Olympics for weighing 100 grams over the permissible limit on the morning of her gold medal bout.\n\nThe case went to the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS), who later dismissed the appeal for a joint-silver medal for Vinesh. The CAS stated that despite the consequences of a failed second weigh-in was draconian, it was on athletes to ensure that they are within the permissible weight limits for their respective events.\n\nBefore the Olympics, Vinesh, along with Sakshi Malik and Bajrang, spearheaded the protests against Brij Bhushan, which ultimately led to the filing of sexual harassment charges on the former federation chief.",

    "raw_text": "Click highlighted text to view annotation\n\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's the lowest I've ever seen Dick Vitale since the owner of the Detroit Pistons called him in and told him he should go into broadcasting.\n\nI can't tell you what an honor it is to even be mentioned in the same breath with Arthur Ashe. This is something I certainly will treasure forever. But as it was said on the tape -- and I also don't have one of those things going with the cue cards, so I'm going to speak longer than anybody else has spoken tonight -- that's the way it goes. Time is very precious to me. I don't know how much I have left, and I have some things that I would like to say. Hopefully, at the end, I will have said something that will be important to other people, too.\n\nBut I can't help it. Now I'm fighting cancer. Everybody knows that. People ask me all the time about how you go through your life and how's your day, and nothing is changed for me. As Dick said, I'm a very emotional and passionate man. I can't help it. That's being the son of Rocco and Angelina Valvano. It comes with the territory. We hug, we kiss, we love.\n\nWhen people say to me, how do you get through life or each day? It's the same thing. To me, there are three things we all should do every day. We should do this every day of our lives. No. 1 is laugh. You should laugh every day. No. 2 is think. You should spend some time in thought. No. 3 is you should have your emotions moved to tears, could be happiness or joy. But think about it. If you laugh, you think and you cry, that's a full day. That's a heckuva day. You do that seven days a week, you're going to have something special.\n\nI rode on the plane up today with Mike Krzyzewski, my good friend and wonderful coach. People don't realize he's 10 times a better person than he is a coach, and we know he's a great coach. He's meant a lot to me in these last five or six months with my battle. But when I look at Mike, I think, we competed against each other as players. I coached against him for 15 years, and I always have to think about what's important in life to me are these three things. Where you started, where you are and where you're going to be. Those are the three things that I try to do every day. When I think about getting up and giving a speech, I can't help it. I have to remember the first speech I ever gave.\n\nI was coaching at Rutgers University. That was my first job. Oh, that's wonderful [reaction to applause], and I was the freshman coach. That's when freshmen played on freshman teams, and I was so fired up about my first job. I see Lou Holtz here. Coach Holtz, who doesn't like the very first job you had? The very first time you stood in the locker room to give a pep talk. That's a special place, the locker room, for a coach to give a talk. So my idol as a coach was Vince Lombardi, and I read this book called \"Commitment to Excellence\" by Vince Lombardi. And in the book, Lombardi talked about the first time he spoke before his Green Bay Packers team in the locker room, and they were perennial losers. I'm reading this, and Lombardi said he was thinking should it be a long talk or a short talk? But he wanted it to be emotional, so it would be brief.\n\nSo here's what I did. Normally you get in the locker room, I don't know, 25 minutes, a half-hour before the team takes the field. You do your little X's and O's, and then you give the great Knute Rockne talk. We all do. Speech No. 84. You pull them right out. You get ready. You get your squad ready. Well, this is the first one I ever gave, and I read this thing.\n\nLombardi, what he said was he didn't go in, he waited. His team wondering, where is he? Where is this great coach? He's not there. Ten minutes, he's still not there. Three minutes before they could take the field, Lombardi comes in, bangs the door open, and I think you all remember what great presence he had, great presence. He walked in, and he walked back and forth, like this, just walked, staring at the players. He said, \"All eyes on me.\"\n\nI'm reading this in this book. I'm getting this picture of Lombardi before his first game, and he said, \"Gentlemen, we will be successful this year, if you can focus on three things and three things only. Your family, your religion and the Green Bay Packers.\" They knocked the walls down, and the rest was history.\n\nI said, \"That's beautiful.\" I'm going to do that. Your family, your religion and Rutgers basketball. That's it. I had it. Listen, I'm 21 years old. The kids I'm coaching are 19, and I'm going to be the greatest coach in the world, the next Lombardi. I'm practicing outside of the locker room, and the managers tell me you got to go in. Not yet, not yet, family, religion, Rutgers basketball. All eyes on me. I got it, I got it. Then finally he said, three minutes. I said, fine. True story. I go to knock the doors open just like Lombardi. Boom! They don't open. I almost broke my arm. Now I was down, the players were looking. Help the coach out, help him out. Now I did like Lombardi, I walked back and forth, and I was going like that with my arm getting the feeling back in it. Finally I said, \"Gentlemen, all eyes on me.\" These kids wanted to play. They're 19. \"Let's go,\" I said. \"Gentlemen, we'll be successful this year if you can focus on three things, and three things only. Your family, your religion and the Green Bay Packers,\" I told them. I did that. I remember that. I remember where I came from.\n\nIt's so important to know where you are. I know where I am right now. How do you go from where you are to where you want to be? I think you have to have an enthusiasm for life. You have to have a dream, a goal. You have to be willing to work for it.\n\nI talked about my family; my family's so important. People think I have courage. The courage in my family are my wife Pam, my three daughters, here, Nicole, Jamie, LeeAnn, my mom, who's right here too. That screen is flashing up there 30 seconds -- like I care about that screen right now, huh? I got tumors all over my body. I'm worried about some guy in the back going, \"30 seconds?\" You got a lot, hey, V\u00e0 F\u00e0 a Napoli, buddy. You got a lot.\n\nI just got one last thing: I urge all of you, all of you, to enjoy your life, the precious moments you have. To spend each day with some laughter and some thought. To get your emotions going. To be enthusiastic every day. And Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"Nothing great could be accomplished without enthusiasm,\" to keep your dreams alive in spite of problems whatever you have. The ability to be able to work hard for your dreams to come true, to become a reality.\n\nNow I look at where I am now, and I know what I want to do. What I would like to be able to do is spend whatever time I have left and to give, and maybe, some hope to others. Arthur Ashe Foundation is a wonderful thing, and AIDS, the amount of money pouring in for AIDS is not enough, but it is significant. But if I told you it's 10 times the amount that goes in to cancer research, I also told you that 500,000 people will die this year of cancer, and I also tell you that one in every four will be afflicted with this disease. And yet somehow, we seem to have put it in a little bit of the background. I want to bring it back on the front table.\n\nWe need your help. I need your help. We need money for research. It may not save my life. It may save my children's lives. It may save someone you love. And it's very important. And ESPN has been so kind to support me in this endeavor and allow me to announce tonight, that with ESPN's support, which means what? Their money and their dollars, and they're helping me: We are starting the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research. And its motto is, \"Don't give up ... don't ever give up.\"\n\nAnd that's what I'm going to try to do every minute that I have left. I will thank God for the day and the moment I have. If you see me, smile and maybe give me a hug. That's important to me too. But try if you can to support, whether it's AIDS or the cancer foundation, so that someone else might survive, might prosper and might actually be cured of this dreaded disease. I can't thank ESPN enough for allowing this to happen. I'm going to work as hard as I can for cancer research and hopefully, maybe, we'll have some cures and some breakthroughs. I'd like to think, I'm going to fight my brains out to be back here again next year for the Arthur Ashe recipient. I want to give it next year!\n\nI know, I gotta go, I gotta go. And I got one last thing, and I said it before, and I'm gonna say it again: Cancer can take away all my physical abilities. It cannot touch my mind, it cannot touch my heart, and it cannot touch my soul. And those three things are going to carry on forever.\n\nI thank you, and God bless you all.\n\nStacey Pressman, Justin Tinsley and Jesse Rogers contributed to the reporting of this piece.\n\nOriginally posted July 18, 2018.",

    "raw_text": "The draw for the knockout playoff round of the new-look UEFA Champions League is upon us.\n\nBut who is taking part in this draw? Why are the league phase positions so important? And when is the next draw?\n\nHere's how it's going to work.\n\nWhen is the draw for the knockout playoff round?\n\nThe draw for the knockout playoff round will take place on Friday, Jan. 31 at 6 a.m. ET / 11 a.m. UK at the House of European Football in Nyon, Switzerland.\n\nWhich clubs are in Friday's draw?\n\nOnly the 16 teams who finish in positions 9 to 24 will have an interest.\n\nThe clubs who finish in the top eight go directly through to the round of 16.\n\nClubs finishing 25th to 36th are eliminated.\n\nDid it matter where you finished in the table?\n\nYes, because the league placings created the knockout bracket. Unlike in previous seasons, where there would be open draws, paths were set after the league phase was completed.\n\nThe new \"seeding\" system means the highest-placed teams can't face each other until the latter stages of the knockout round.\n\nFor instance, if we look at the final table, Liverpool and Barcelona finished first and second and cannot play each other until the final. The teams in third and fourth -- Arsenal and Internazionale -- can't play Liverpool or Barcelona until the semifinals.\n\nHowever, the value of being placed high in the table has been complicated by poor European seasons for Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid, who unexpectedly became possible opponents earlier in the knockout rounds.\n\nIndeed, with Man City finishing 22nd it's created a heavyweight knockout playoff round tie -- as they must face 11th or 12th ... Read Madrid or Bayern Munich.\n\nPSG, meanwhile, will have to face Barcelona or Liverpool in the round of 16 if they get through.\n\nHow does the knockout draw work?\n\nTeams are paired by their final position, in order (e.g. 9th and 10th, 11th and 12th, etc). Of each pair, teams will be drawn into opposite halves of the bracket. For instance, 11th (Real Madrid) and 12th (Bayern Munich) will split off and cannot play each other until the final (which is the case for all pairs).\n\nBefore the draw, paired teams will have two possible opponents. If we take Real Madrid and Bayern again, they will be drawn to play either 21st (Celtic) or 22nd (Man City).\n\nThe eight unseeded teams are drawn first into a position in the bracket. This starts with 23rd and 24th, and moves down to 17th and 18th. In each case the first team drawn goes into the first half of the bracket (let's say Celtic), meaning the other club in the pair (which would be Man City) goes into the second half.\n\nThe draw then moves on to the seeded teams, continuing with 15th and 16th down to ninth and 10th. Again, the first team drawn goes into the first half of the bracket (so if that's Bayern, they'd be playing Celtic) -- which automatically creates a knockout playoff round fixture -- and so on with the other paired team into the second half (which makes Man City vs. Real Madrid).\n\nThe seeded clubs will play the second leg at home.\n\nSo there's no country protection?\n\nCorrect. Clubs from the same country can play each other from the knockout playoff round onward. For instance, PSG have to play AS Monaco or Brest.\n\nIt was also possible to draw one of the eight teams you'd already faced -- including the most recent opponents from Matchday 8.\n\nWhat dates are the knockout playoff round?\n\nFirst legs: Feb. 11-12, 2025\n\nSecond legs: Feb. 18-19, 2025\n\nEach club will play once on a Tuesday and once on a Wednesday.\n\nSo what about the top eight clubs?\n\nAfter the knockout playoff round draw, the teams who finished inside the top eight will still have four possible opponents.\n\nFor instance, Liverpool and Barcelona would still be able to play any of 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th (PSG, Benfica, Monaco and Brest). This is because Liverpool and Barcelona could yet be drawn into either half, but only into the specific paths for those fixtures.\n\nOnce the knockout playoff round is complete, and two of those clubs have been knocked out, Liverpool and Barcelona would have two possible opponents remaining: the winners of the knockout playoff round ties.\n\nWhen is the draw for the round of 16?\n\nThe round of 16 draw then takes place on Friday, Feb. 21, when Liverpool and Barcelona would simply be drawn into opposite halves of the bracket -- which would create a fixture against one of the winners of the ties involving PSG, Benfica, Monaco and Brest.\n\nThe teams placed first to eighth are seeded and will be at home in the second leg.\n\nFirst legs: March 4-5, 2025\n\nSecond legs: March 11-12, 2025\n\nThe knockout bracket is now set through to the final.\n\nWho gets home advantage in the quarterfinals and semifinals?\n\nThere will be one more draw, straight after the round of 16 is set, to determine the home teams in the second leg for the quarterfinals and semifinals. This is not done on league phase seeding.",

    "raw_text": "PV Sindhu's dream of a hat-trick of Olympic medals was brought to a halt on Thursday night by an inspired performance from China's He Bing Jiao, who won their pre-quarterfinal match 21-19 21-14.\n\nExactly three years on from the day Sindhu beat Bing Jiao in the bronze medal playoff at the Tokyo Olympics, it was a role reversal in Paris as the Chinese was in complete command almost right from the off.\n\nAUGUST 1: LIVE | INDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nAt no point in this match was Sindhu allowed to build momentum. Bing Jiao's defensive brilliance ensured that she became the first Chinese ever to beat Sindhu at an Olympics or World Championship.\n\nBing Jiao raced into a 5-1 lead early with a mix of aggressive strokes and some gifts from Sindhu as well. Sindhu hauled the deficit back to 5-8 and then to 10-11, but she could never really go on a run of points throughout the whole match. In fact, the only time she managed to win three consecutive points was to go from 2-8 to 5-8 in the second game.\n\nHowever, despite never being able to force a consistent run of points, Sindhu managed to scrap and remain in the hunt in the first game right until the end. That's when it felt like the defining moment of the match happened. At 19-19, Bing Jiao took the points in two consecutive rallies which were the best of the match.\n\nFirst, both players exchanged quick shots, before a big cross court smash from the Chinese evaded a diving forehand from Sindhu and just caught the line to give her a game point.\n\nAfter that, Sindhu somehow picked up an impossible shuttle low, covered the net really nicely and kept defending the point until she couldn't, as Bing Jiao took the point and the first game, and then let out a massive roar.\n\nSindhu's body language at the break between the two games wasn't really encouraging, as the shoulders seemed to drop a bit, and her morale took a hit from coming so close but not being able to close that first game out.\n\n\"That first game should've been different. If I had won the first game, I felt I'd have had a lot more confidence within me,\" Sindhu said after the game.\n\nThat last point of the second game was the last instance at which this match felt like a contest. Bing Jiao raced into an 8-2 lead. Beyond that, there was the odd big smash from Sindhu to give herself a glimmer of hope, but that kept being quickly snuffed out by Bing Jiao. Her combination of incredible court coverage, shuttle retrieval and then picking the right moment to play the big attacking shots was just too much for Sindhu.\n\n\"In the second game, she took a big lead, I was trying to cover it but I kept making simple errors,\" Sindhu said.\n\nThis will be the first time Sindhu returns from an Olympics without a medal in her career. \"It's a sad day, but I can keep my head held high,\" she concluded.\n\nWhether or not she returns to this stage for Los Angeles 2028, Sindhu has already written her name into Indian sporting folklore with those two medals in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo.\n\nThis defeat will sting, particularly after all the work that went into getting her body functional enough to make it to these Olympics at all after the injury layoffs at the end of 2022 and 2023.\n\nIf that was the last the Olympics saw of Sindhu, then who can argue against her keeping her head held high?",

    "raw_text": "World No. 10 PV Sindhu expressed her happiness over participating in her first Olympics, as she became one of the seven badminton players to make the cut for Rio Olympics 2016.\n\nSindhu and fellow Hyderabadi Saina Nehwal, ranked two rungs above her, will be the two big hopes for the country in the August 5-21 sports spectacle in August.\n\nWith two back-to-back bronze medals in the World Championships adorning her list of achievements, the Rio-bound Sindhu said, \"It's much more than the world championship. The ultimate goal for anyone is to get a medal in the Olympics, where the conditions and environment are totally different. I am very excited. It's my first Olympics,\".\n\nWith the games approaching in a month's time, Sindhu felt that greater focus on fitness was needed. \"We have been training hard. We need to push ourselves more. We are doing training off and on court, but the main thing is to keep ourselves fit and healthy. We need to be healthy as well as injury free,\" she said.\n\nTalking about her most difficult opponents, the badminton ace stated that Thailand's former world champion Ratchanok Intanon and Chinese Taipei's Tai Tzu Ying are particularly difficult opponents for her. \"As of now, Ratchanok is really challenging (sic) and is doing really well. I have recently played with her. And also Tai, she has also been playing well.\"\n\nHowever, she added, \"We can't say one person can win as every person - from 1-20 ranking - is capable of winning a medal. Whoever plays well on that day will be the winner. We can't take it easy against anyone.\"\n\nSindhu, who said she had been working on her on-court movement, pointed out that her extra height gave her some advantages but there were also some drawbacks. \"I have been doing footwork programme and have been doing various sessions to move faster. My strong point always has been my attacking game, but nowadays nobody is giving that (leeway to) attack. Because I am tall (6-foot, 10-inches) everybody plays a fast game and downward strokes.\n\n\"I have been doing more of downward stroke (countering) because against players who are tall they (opponents) don't give chances to attack. They keep you more in defence. There are advantages as well as disadvantages with being tall. One thing (advantage) is the (better) reach, (but) they make you bend a lot more,\" she said.",

The allegations reportedly occurred between 2012 and 2016, which were Tucker's first five seasons in the NFL.\n\nAbout an hour after The Banner's article was posted, Tucker called the allegations \"unequivocally false\" in a lengthy response on social media.\n\n\"Throughout my career as a professional athlete, I have always sought to conduct myself with the utmost professionalism,\" Tucker posted to X on Thursday. \"I have never before been accused of misconduct of any kind, and I have never been accused of acting inappropriately in front of a massage therapist or during a massage therapy session or during other bodywork.\"\n\nIn his post, Tucker said the article \"takes innocuous, or ambiguous, interactions and skews them so out of proportion that they are no longer recognizable. ... This is desperate tabloid fodder.\"\n\nTucker could be subject to discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy.\n\n\"We first became aware of the allegations from the reporter investigating this story as they were not previously shared with the NFL,\" league spokesperson Brian McCarthy said. \"We take any allegation seriously and will look into the matter.\"\n\nThe Ravens issued a statement saying \"we take any allegations of this nature seriously and will continue to monitor the situation.\"\n\nAttorneys for Tucker denied the allegations of inappropriate behavior, telling The Banner that it's speculative and \"impossible to prove.\" His lawyers also said Tucker has never been banned from the two spas.\n\nThe Banner said it began its investigation after receiving a tip on Jan. 9. Six massage therapists contacted by The Banner allege that Tucker exposed his genitals, brushed two of them with his exposed penis and left what they believed to be ejaculate on the massage table after three of his treatments.\n\n\"I support a process that allows claims to be properly investigated,\" Tucker said in his post. \"But, for the sake of myself and my family, I cannot allow these false claims to go unchallenged. I cannot be any clearer. These allegations are false and incredibly hurtful to both me and, more importantly, my family.\"\n\nTucker, 35, is the most accurate kicker in NFL history, converting 89.1% of his field goal attempts. He is the longest-tenured player on the Ravens who was part of the team's Super Bowl championship team in 2012.",

    "raw_text": "A year, especially an Olympic year, can be a long time in sport.\n\nIn March, Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand missed qualifying for the Paris Olympics. In December, the women's doubles pair are the only Indian badminton players to qualify for the season-ending BWF World Tour Finals in Hangzhou, China, -- where only the year's top 8 compete. Soon after, the 21-year-olds lifted the Syed Modi International trophy at home for their first Super 300 title.\n\nAfter a very challenging season, the end of 2024 is shaping up to be a good one for them. To be one of the top 8 pairs in the world in a discipline such as women's doubles is no small achievement for an Indian pair. Their upcoming World Tour Finals debut on Wednesday has the youngsters both excited and nervous.\n\n\"I'm very grateful to qualify for the BWF World Tour Finals. I have always seen it on TV... now it's happening as we are in that eight, I'm so happy,\" Treesa tells ESPN. \"I can't believe that we qualified. It's only the top eight in the world, the best performance throughout the year. So I'm really excited and also nervous at the same time, but looking forward to it,\" adds Gayatri.\n\nConsistent performance is the key for the World Tour finals. The qualification criteria accounts for the best results from 14 tournaments throughout the year. While the Indian pair may not have made a big impact on tour, they have played consistently, getting a bunch of good, top ten wins and staying fit to play 19 tournaments.\n\nTo be among the top 8 in the world is a huge morale boost. At 21, both Treesa and Gayatri are still young and had missed a chunk of 2023 season due to injury concerns, which also contributed to their Paris miss. From that lens, the 2024 season has been one of significant incremental growth.\n\n\"I think this year was a good year for us. I think we beaten the top players in the top 10 and it's a confidence booster for us. When we play the top players and beat them, I believe we can be in that top ten or top five in the world. That confidence is always there when playing with those players and fighting with them,\" says Treesa.\n\nAt the start of the year, while just returning to the tour full-fledged after an injury setback, the duo were instrumental in India winning the Badminton Asia Team Championship in February. In badminton team events, doubles is crucial to victory and India beat the likes of China, Japan and Thailand to win gold.\n\nBut early exits in the first half of the season meant they were out of the Race to Paris qualification in March. On their part, they took the Olympics heartbreak gamely and focused on the next thing with a little help from national coach Pullela Gopichand.\n\n\"It was definitely a little sad when we realised we're not going to make it. But at the same time, we knew that this is not the first and last Olympics, there's more coming. So, we were calm. And focusing on the next tournament instead of constantly dwelling about Olympics. There was a lot of, advice from dad [Gopichand] and our coaches. We were okay,\" says Gayatri.\n\nThis kind of a positive attitude meant that best run of the year (other than the Syed Modi title) came soon after, at the Singapore Open 750 in May. They reached semifinals beating two higher-ranked South Korean pairs -- a huge feat in women's doubles badminton.\n\n\"In the Singapore Masters, we played against two Koreans and they were really tough matches which we won. That gave me a lot of confidence to move on and to just break that last hurdle,\" explains Gayatri.\n\nGayatri, who has grown up around badminton, is more philosophical when she talks about the newer challenges they face as they grow in experience, using sporting jargon like hurdles.\n\n\"Sometimes when we're playing against the top best in the world we're just stuck and no idea what to do to, how win the game to move forward. We're trying to step that up, get the strategy right when we are confused. To break that little hurdle, I feel has been challenging. It's gotten better this year.\"\n\nStrategy in women's doubles often can be a crucial, unseen weapon. Women's doubles is a defence-heavy discipline of badminton and requires elite fitness and stamina to prevail in the long, intense rallies. Treesa-Gayatri play a more creative game with plenty of attack and guile to counterattack the general defence, and have the weapons to unravel opponents' game when thing click. But the base for it is often physicality in the long game.\n\nFitness though has been an issue, especially for Gayatri given her injury setback in 2023 and she says she is learning to manage her body's needs amid the incessant grind of the BWF Tour.\n\n\"The whole year has been a little tricky, but it's always going to be there. We're just being prepared and even in the injuries, we're trying to stay positive. We're doing what we can do,\" explains Gayatri. \"My body is like that so it's going to be a little challenging. But I'm working on strength, flexibility and all of those things which are important for me. I'm putting more focus on to the little things... on rehab and all of that instead of just trying to get back on court.\"\n\nFor Treesa, the battle is more mental as she works towards emotional balance along with upscaling her skills. \"I think need to be mentally stronger. Losing a match is not in our hand but what we do the next day is in our hand... just get up, go to the gym, do whatever the schedule is. Don't just be sad if one thing didn't go your way, do your best the next day. One day you will get what you need, work for that day I would say.\"\n\nThese are impressive words from the two who are still finding their way to the top.\n\nThe overall improvement is there to see as they gear up for their 20th tournament of the year. The BWF World Tour finals won't be easy, where the Indians are placed in a group with world no. 1 Liu Shengshu/Tan Ning, regular nemeses Pearly Tan-Thinaah Muralitharan and Matsuyama Nami-Shida Chiharu. But more than their performance in Hangzhou, it's the experience and learning that will matter and they know it.\n\n\"It's not going to be easy but I feel like we're going to learn a lot at the tournament. I'm going there to have fun, give my 100% and get back and work again. That's all I'm thinking about right now,\" says Gayatri.\n\nNo matter how the next week goes, Treesa and Gayatri have done enough this season to make 2025 a year to look forward to",

The seven reserves in each conference were selected by a vote by the league's coaches after a combination of fans, media and players determined the five starters in each conference.\n\nJoining Wembanyama from the Western Conference were Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards, Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis, LA Clippers guard James Harden, Memphis Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr., Houston Rockets center Alperen Sengun and Oklahoma City Thunder forward Jalen Williams.\n\nIt was the 11th selection for Harden, as well as the 10th for Davis, followed by the third for Edwards and second for Jackson. It was the first selection for Wembanyama, Sengun and Williams.\n\nThe Eastern Conference reserves consisted of Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, Indiana Pacers forward Pascal Siakam, Cleveland Cavaliers guard Darius Garland and forward Evan Mobley, Detroit Pistons guard Cade Cunningham, Milwaukee Bucks guard Damian Lillard and Miami Heat guard Tyler Herro.\n\nLillard made it for the ninth time, while it was the fourth for Brown, the third for Siakam and the second for Garland. Mobley, Cunningham and Herro were first-time selections.\n\nThe Cavaliers -- with Garland, Mobley and starter Donovan Mitchell -- were the only team to get three players onto this year's rosters. The Celtics (Brown and Jayson Tatum), Lakers (Davis and James), Thunder (Williams and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) and New York Knicks (Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns) each had two.\n\nThe coaches for this year's All-Star Game will be Mark Daigneault from the Thunder and Kenny Atkinson from the Cavaliers. Because of the change in format this season, which has the 24 All-Stars broken up into three teams of eight-man rosters -- plus the winning team from the Rising Stars Challenge on Friday night -- one assistant coach from the Thunder and one from the Cavaliers will coach two of the teams.",

    "raw_text": "India qualified for the final of the Asian Champions Trophy after a 2-0 win over Japan in the semifinal with two goals in the final quarter, despite knocking on the door throughout the course of the game, in which India failed to convert any of their 12 penalty corners throughout the game.\n\nIndia had run into an inspired Yu Kudo in the Japanese goal, who pulled off stunning save after stunning save to keep the match in the balance. Eventually, Junon Kawai conceded a penalty stroke at the beginning of the fourth quarter, pushing Deepika in the back in the circle. Navneet Kaur stepped up from the spot and sent a shot to the goalkeeper's right, to which Kudo got a sizeable hand, but there was just enough power in the shot to send the shot into the net.\n\nThe second goal came with five minutes to go in the game, after an excellent move down the right flank. First, Neha played Sunelita Toppo through down the wing, and then her square ball found Lalremsiami at the back post, who finished it with Kudo taken out of the game by the cross.\n\nIndia then saw off the game professionally, conceding only two penalty corners throughout the game, which they defended well enough.\n\nAhead of the final, though, Harendra Singh will be concerned by India's profligacy in front of goal. They had a number of chances from open play, but Deepika, Sangita Kumari and Beauty Dungdung couldn't take big opportunities that were presented to them. Out of their 12 penalty corners, India couldn't even take a shot with four of them, due to poor traps from the halters - with Sushila Chanu and Neha both making mistakes in that aspect of the game.\n\nIndia will now face China in the final on Wednesday evening. They will take confidence from their 3-0 win over China in the group stage, but will know that they cannot afford to be miss the number of chances they did in the semifinal.\n\nYou can relive the match on our live blog, below:",

    "raw_text": "The Indian women's hockey team maintained their winning run in the Asian Champions Trophy with a dominant 3-0 win over China in Rajgir, Bihar on Saturday.\n\nGoals from Sangita Kumari, captain Salima Tete and Deepika did the job while India's defence stood strong to ensure China don't open their account. This was their fourth win out of four matches, going to the top of the table with 12 points while China are second with nine points to their name. Both teams had qualified to the semifinals earlier after winning their first three matches.\n\nIn the opening quarter of the match, there was not much to separate both teams, however, it was India who were playing better hockey on the ball. China concentrated on defending deep and taking their chance on the counter, but they found it hard against a solid Indian backline.\n\nThe first goal of the match came after the half-time break as Sangita produced a moment of brilliance to break the deadlock. The Indian forward brilliantly deflected the ball in after the pass came in from Sushila Chanu in the defence. It was a superb finish as Sangita's back was facing the goal, yet, she managed to get the connection and the direction absolutely spot on to beat the goalkeeper.\n\nFive minutes later, it was captain Salima Tete who doubled the lead after lovely movement of the ball. Beauty DungDung played the pass to Preeti Dubey inside the circle and her ball to Salima was perfect as the Indian captain came up with a first time finish from a close range.\n\nChina were expected to up the ante but they struggled to create clear cut chances thanks to India's defence. Sushila and Udita also deserve praise for their work at the back. India maintained their control over the match in the final quarter and a desperate China removed their goalkeeper in search of a goal. With seconds to go, India won back-to-back penalty corner and the Deepika scored her eighth goal of the tournament with her dragflick. India will next face Japan on Sunday in the last group match before shifting their attention to the semifinal on Tuesday.\n\nYou can relive the match on our live blog, below:",

But what would have given Lovlina the belief was the fact that she had beaten Qian enroute her gold medal at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nLovlina began the bout well as she found her range and maintained her shape. The Indian pulled off a couple of fine left-hook + right-jab combinations, but Li matched her punch for punch. It was a closely contested round that narrowly went the Chinese boxer's way.\n\nLi, who won silver at the Tokyo Olympics, launched a flurry of punches as soon as the bell rang for the second round and caught Lovlina straight in the face. Li didn't do anything special per se, but controlled the pace of the round and Lovlina needed to show intent to convince the judges. She pulled off a neat two-punch combination on Li, but it wasn't enough as the second round also went Li's way. However, Lovlina still had a chance: the bout was all square on four of the judge's cards and only one judge had Li down as the better boxer.\n\nBut Lovlina just couldn't find her best when she needed it the most. The Indian landed a few strong jabs at Li's mid-riff, but that wasn't enough to impress the judges. What Li did, though, did. She caught Lovlina in a brilliant 1-2 combination that shook the Indian for a couple of seconds. That did the trick as Li went on to win by points and Indian boxing's barren run at Paris came to an end.\n\nLovlina, who moved up from the 69kg to 75kg division after the former was dropped from the Olympic program, was among India's top medal hopefuls at the Paris Olympics. She is a World champion and the Asian Games silver medallist in the weight division and came within a win away from becoming one of Indian boxing's GOATs. But in the end, none of those credentials mattered. Lovlina was beaten by a better boxer. Despite two World champions and World's medallists in their roster, Indian boxing returns with zero medals.",

    "raw_text": "Yet, the most a defence can score at once is two points, and one of kabaddi's fundamentals meant that the Pirates always had a chance with their raiding. And it proved to be the case when Narender Redhu's side took an 8-7 lead, Ayan with a stunning raid that earned him two points.\n\nWhile the Steelers had more tackle points than raid points, they continued to gift points to the opposition with cheap Super Tackles, and a five-point lead became three with another present to make it 15-12 in favour of the Steelers, just as the first half came to an end.\n\nIn the second half however, the Steelers proved why they were the champions-in-waiting. Sudhakar had whittled the lead down to one for the Pirates, but as Devank was revived, the Steelers defence simply proved too good for the league's best raider, shoving him out with the strength of seven, not one. Shadloui upended Ayan soon after to make it 19-16, the roar of the Pune crowd that once adored him for their own team reverberating in the arena.\n\nWhile the Steelers are all about their defence, it's also about their raiders - Vinay and Shivam Tavare ticking things over, with the latter also grabbing tackle points to top the final with nine. Vinay then sparked off the winning two minutes, a Messi-esque swivel of the hips in a raid making the Pirates look like amateurs as he grabbed two points, and as the Steelers unit smothered whatever the Pirates sent their way, an all-out to make it 26-17 in the final ended the contest.\n\nAs the game ticked over to the final minutes, Devank became only the fourth raider in PKL history to score 300 points in a season, but there was no answer from the Pirates. The result was a foregone conclusion, and Manpreet Singh, who had lost his voice after a game (and season) spent screaming his lungs out, broke down in tears, joined by Shivam Patare, as reality hit.\n\n\"Kabaddi won today. We got the fruits of our hard work,\" said the Steelers' coach after the final whistle blew. He could not have been more right - and it all began with the auction.\n\nThe Steelers had lost last year's final to Puneri Paltan, with Shadloui then inflicting a loss on Manpreet, noting they needed a left corner. It turned out Shadloui was that left corner. \"Which team is Shadloui, that team is champion,\" said the Iranian after the final, and it was his presence as an all-rounder that proved to be the missing piece.\n\nYet, Manpreet Singh's side began with a losing run, only for the coach to stick to his guns. His defence-first approach came to the fore, especially since Shadloui also chipped in with raid points, the first since Manjeet Chillar in PKL history to score both 50+ raid points and 50+ tackle points in a single season. The defensive and raiding unit around the Iranian also proved that it was a team, a unit that could deal with the best of individual talent the league could throw at them.\n\nThis was a season-long gift to Manpreet, Shadloui aptly describing himself as Santa to a coach who was more naughty than nice, but with a gold medal hung around his neck - lists be damned.\n\nAs captain Jaideep waltzed the trophy over to Manpreet, the Haryana Steelers, fashioned in the image of their coach's steely resolve had all the glory. PKL champions for the first time, but if they keep doing what they do... it won't be the last.",

    "raw_text": "There's an essential truth to the Hockey India League -- as true in 2024 as it was in 2013 - in that high-quality premier domestic hockey competition is essential for the overall development of the sport in the country. When it ran for five years in its first avatar (only the men's league), India hockey benefited immensely, improving their standards on and off the pitch, and set off a chain of events that culminated in the men's team earning back-to-back Olympic medals.\n\nIf it was this good, why was it canned in the first place? Well, running a league comes at a high cost and the first time out, both the franchise owners and Hockey India failed to make the league sustainable -- issues included rising expenses and calendar issues (because of the introduction of the Pro League). Having a solid program for the national teams ensured the India don't lose out much at the international level but the upcoming talent, and especially the women players, were missing out on the benefits of playing in a world class domestic competition.\n\nRestarting it, then, was important. But have the financial issues that plagued them been sorted? Why should an investor get involved in this second avatar of the league? Can they make it a sustainable enterprise? ESPN spoke to HIL owners to understand:\n\nWhat is the motivation to invest?\n\nFor JSW Sports, who own a men's and women's team (Soorma Hockey Club) in the HIL, the motivation was simple: to develop the sport, especially in Punjab and Haryana. And they have the experience of running franchise teams across different sports to back them up.\n\n\"A lot of decisions we've taken, in terms of team acquisitions, they are often looked at from two important lenses,\" said Divyanshu Singh, the COO of JSW Sports. \"One lens is always the development of sports in the country. Then there are decisions which are taken only from commercial lenses. We own Bengaluru FC now for more than a decade and through the club, we're investing in the grassroots and being the only academy in the country which is accredited by AFC and AIFF five stars. We're then aiming to develop football through that channel.\"\n\n\"It's a similar approach taken for hockey because we're so deeply invested in Olympic sports. In the case of hockey, it ticks both the boxes -- the big focus being development. Especially with Punjab and Haryana, very important and strategic areas for the development of hockey. In the case of Punjab, 80-90% of talent in the men's team is coming from there and 80-90% of talent in the women's team is coming from Haryana.\"\n\nSoorma will represent Punjab in the men's league and Haryana in women's league. According to Singh, the group is in for a long-haul -- they 'want to be active' in the off season with the main objective being opening a residential academy in Chandigarh while also starting various other grassroot activities, including coach education programs. They also want to use hockey as a tool to tackle bigger societal issues. \"We want to develop not only as a sports brand but also as a lifestyle, cultural and societal brand,\" Singh said.\n\nIndian tennis legend Mahesh Bhupathi, who's the CEO of SG Sports and Entertainment which also owns two teams in the league, is not bothered about the issues that plagued the league in its previous run. What's crucial for him is that the league comes through successfully in the first two seasons. \"India sports has come a long way in the last five years, and it's growing every year. We're very excited about hockey because of the recent success,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, like JSW, Shrachi Sports also own two teams (from Kolkata) in the Hockey India League. For them, investing in hockey teams was a 'bold' decision. \"Sports in India has been a recent industry. Cricket has shown us that sports can be an economy through IPL and other asset monetization over the years,\" said Rahul Todi, MD of the Shrachi Group.\n\nFrom Shrachi's point of view, it's a great time to invest in hockey because India is constantly delivering at the international level. They are prepared to wait on the returns and have confidence that the Hockey India will deliver after learning lessons from the 2013-17 period.\n\nHow long are the prepared to wait for returns?\n\nJSW insists the vision is long term and therefore prepared to wait a bit more on the returns.\n\n\"The IPL teams took seven to eight years to break even. The non cricket teams take much longer. Of course we're in for the long haul. To give you a context, with regard to Pro Kabaddi, we've managed to breakeven in five years. In hockey, we're looking at a time cycle of 7-8 years. A lot depends on the way the media rights pan out. The whole central sponsorship and media rights revenue gets divided between all the teams, which ends up being the big contributor for revenue sources,\" Singh said.\n\nFor Todi, that window is a bit smaller. \"From team ownership, there's a two-three years gestation period,\" he said. \"The commercial rights are done, we haven't got the figures yet, but I am assuming it will be a good figure. Having said that, the gestation or the difficulty tends to happen because it's hockey. It's taking a lot of time while cricket and IPL can do a 10-year deal. Hockey India is also doing a multiple year deal. It is also a good sign, gives us confidence as co-investors. I think from the league perspective, we would definitely be incurring a loss. Second year, we hope to breakeven but it will involve a lot of effort from every stakeholder, including the Indian economy.\"\n\nThe rights he refers to are that Hockey India have signed a three-year broadcasting deal with Doordarshan and Sony Sports while Hero MotoCorp will be the title sponsor of the league for the next three years.\n\nBhupathi is prepared to buckle down for the long haul too. \"Your assumptions and my assumptions will never match. We own a team, it's an asset, we'll break even when we have to break even,\" he said. \"As of now, our focus is now that the next 24 months are critical. To make sure we do a lot of the right things. To make sure that in 2027 everybody is looking forward to it. The IPL is literally a festival and there's opportunity for another sport to also get some traction at that level.\"\n\nWhat's common is a belief that the federation have learnt their lessons from the failure of HIL 1.\n\n\"I'm sure Hockey India knows the mistake they made last time and won't repeat them,\" said Bhupati. \"As an owner group, I think they are very hands on about discussing what's going on with us. We're all aware that it will take one or two seasons to build the property. We're all committed to doing that.\"\n\n\"Hockey India had a lot of learning from previous experiences,\" said Todi. \"A lot of factors have been taken into consideration to keep the cost low in the beginning. As you can see in the format, one location for men, one for women. Number two: player salary caps were also kept at a reasonable level. Hockey India League has been preparing for this for more than a year, I think they are very confident of getting the kind of support it deserves.\"\n\nWhat is the main reason for their optimism?\n\nWhile the financial expectations can differ, all the owners are on the same page in terms of making the league a success with a newer generation of sports consumers, with focus on digital penetration.\n\nTodi, for one, is optimistic that the ever-growing digital landscape will push the league towards success. \"The ecosystem of sports is growing, even globally we're seeing sports entertainment or original sports production with Netflix and Amazon Prime focusing on it in a big way.\"\n\n\"I am just comparing the period of 2013-17 whereas to now. The world has changed. India's digital penetration has increased. More and more people today are using their phones for entertainment. I think all these factors will play a role in ensuring that it becomes a long-term success,\" he said.\n\nJSW's Singh is optimistic, too, and stressed on the need to expand the sport to younger generations. \"The exciting challenge for a sport like hockey is that it has about 70 million fans in India out of the 695 million sports fans who exist as per the Deloitte Google report,\" he said. \"What is important is to grow the popularity in Gen Z. The big fans of hockey, I would say, are the older generation. Also, hockey is not so much of an urban phenomenon. Of course, it is popular in our home states of Punjab and Haryana but if you take the rest of the country, its popularity stems a lot from rural and semi-urban India,\" Singh said.\n\n\"Which is perfectly fine as well because a bigger majority of the sports fans in India are coming from those categories. From a long-term growth perspective of the sport, it's very important that it appeals to the Gen Z and what works in favour of hockey is that India is doing well. Any sport which must grow commercially, it is quintessential that India do well.\"",

    "raw_text": "On the surface, Kurt Streeter's story on Nate Boyer is an almost Bunyanesque tale about a man trying to change the world one adventure at a time. But the story also explores something simple and universal -- the question each of us faces of how long to hold on to our dreams, and at what cost.\n\nIn this story behind the story, Streeter explains how the place where he found Boyer at the end of his reporting process -- a futon on a second-story landing in a friend's apartment in Los Angeles -- helped shape his approach to Boyer's story:\n\nHE WAS the most unusual NFL rookie I'd ever seen.\n\nHe hoped to win a position on the line but stood 5-foot-11 and struggled to reach 225 pounds. He was old: 34. He was a military vet, a Green Beret who hadn't played football -- not even pee wee -- until he walked on at the University of Texas.\n\nNow it was training camp and Boyer was a Seattle Seahawk.\n\n\"Do I look small out there?\" he asked, more than once.\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nBut I noticed some other things, too. Boyer was rock-jawed. He had a steel will. He possessed constant, restless energy, a perfect fit for his constant, restless drive. He could be anxious and doubting, but he also could be confident and full of optimism.\n\nAlways and in all things, he tested himself. Always, he followed his dreams, no matter where they led.\n\nAt the same time, he ran from anything you or I would call a normal life: a comfortable home, a nice car, a loving family, a stable job.\n\nThat was the price he paid, and for a guy in his mid-30s, it was steep.\n\nFascinating guy, I thought.\n\nWhat becomes of someone like that? Where does he end up? Between my other as\u00adsignments and the commitments on his jammed schedule, we kept a conversation going for months, in person, by phone and on the internet. The passage of time served this story well.\n\nBack in the 1990s, when I started out in journalism, I worked on a series of cinema verit\u00e9 documentaries for PBS, the kind of films that follow a subject closely and let the narrative play out on its own. It was a slow and painstaking enterprise that has influenced my reporting ever since. Whenever possible, I like to let time unfold and watch change happen. I did that with Nate Boyer.\n\nWhen I went to see Boyer in April, I was surprised. I thought by then, months after he had been cut by the Seahawks, he would have turned away from his football dreams. Time to settle down. Maybe he'd have a good, solid job with the NFL, or in the movie industry in L.A., where he was gaining connections. Maybe he'd be down in Austin, working as a radio analyst for Texas football or even coaching a high school team.\n\nThat's what I expected, but this story shows where I found him instead. It was an unlikely place for someone who embodies two of the most potent American archetypes: the big-time football player and the soldier at war. It was that unexpectedness that made Boyer's story the kind I like to tell.",

    "raw_text": "We sat down with Taffy Brodesser-Akner to see what it's like to write about athletes' biggest moments -- without being a traditional sports fan.\n\n1. You write about prominent figures in defining moments, like your recent story about Ben Simmons and the NBA draft. What is it about the combination of celebrity and circumstance that appeals to you?\n\nI think it's way too easy to be canned and jaded as a celebrity. It's not their fault -- they say the same things they've said because they're asked the same questions over and over. The only real instability you see in the system is when they don't quite know how the next thing will turn out. If you stay and listen and watch, you will always find that everything they do is about that. Because however what's next turns out, the only guarantee about it, failure or success, is that it's going to be public.\n\n2. You're not a traditional sports fan, and seem to enjoy immersing yourself in a sport and its culture as you begin to pursue a particular profile. What is it like to learn about your subject and his/her sport at the same time? What do you find energizing about that process?\n\nBy \"not a traditional sports fan,\" are you referring to the fact that I've had to google each of my assignments? There are a couple of answers here. One is that if you only write about what you know, you never get to be able to learn something new. The thing about sports is that people who loves sports (or any corner of the culture) don't always see the thing that is obviously ridiculous and obviously poignant, because they saw it for the first time so long ago. I couldn't believe the fact that Ben was the best player in the draft meant that he was going to go to the worst team, and that he'd have to go live somewhere according to what someone else decided. Most people take that for granted, but when I realized that, it became the cornerstone of the piece. When you don't know anything, you get to avoid the cliches of the person. Avoiding the cliches of a person in a profile in general is very hard, which I know from not always avoiding them when I write about people I'm familiar with (I have been blessed with great editors). Second, in the year since I've been writing for ESPN the Magazine, I've come to really understand what is unifying and gratifying about fandom. It's also put my children's friends in awe of me. \"Did you really meet Russell Wilson,\" they ask me at birthday parties. I try to explain what a write-around is, but ultimately I give up and say yes. But bonus third answer, and this will hearken back to my newborn babe first answer: This stuff is pretty exciting to watch, as it turns out. I guess you guys knew that, though.\n\nI'll say here that I'm also pretty lucky to have editors I don't have to pretend I know more than in front of, and who must have to really calm their own nerves when they hear that I don't know how drafts work. Or when they are. Or that this was the method by which players were distributed to teams.\n\n3. How do you know when you have a good character and what happens when it ends up that you don't?\n\nIt takes a lot of pressure off of me not to think about what I'm writing as the subject's story. Rather, it's my story about the subject. I came up with this theory as I stood crying outside Barclay's a few years ago after I interviewed Nicki Minaj, who had literally fallen asleep during the interview portion of my first-ever feature assignment for GQ. Writing for GQ was my career goal, and I stood there thinking it was all over. But ultimately (thanks to one of those great editors I was talking about) I realized it wasn't up to her to make my story good. It's not her story; it's mine. She's already done her job well. That's why she gets a profile! It's my job to write a good story. It gives your subject way too much power if your story's quality reflects what kind of interview they were. Most people aren't great at talking about themselves.\n\n4. Your prose has a distinctive pulse and energy. How do you explain the importance of rhythm in writing?\n\nThat's very nice of you. I think everything should sound like how you talk, since most people are far more interesting in a conversation than when they assume a writerly stance. Be a writer when you structure your story, but be a person trying to keep someone's attention at a cocktail party when there are 120 better-looking people in the room. Sometime I teach classes, and in them I see that the greatest challenge for great storytellers and great talkers is learning to sound more like themselves in their writing. Also, I try not to begin sentences with dependent clauses because I have a theory that the rhythm of that kind of sentence lulls people to sleep like they're in a rocking chair.\n\n5. As sports figures become increasingly sophisticated in managing image, gaining access for a profile can be tricky. How do you navigate the challenges of getting close to a subject in the reporting process these days?\n\nThere is so much standing around and letting the person sniff around you as they ascertain your intentions. You have to do your time in that. You have to show people you're a normal person because by the time they've gotten to you, they've been burned so many times. You have to go in with a certain kind of sympathy. You have to listen and not ask so many questions and let them tell you their story. When you do that, you allow them to convey to the world the thing that they feel misunderstood about. When you let them lead the interview, they feel heard and they're excited to feel heard. We are all excited when we feel heard.\n\nPlus 1: When did you know this was what you wanted to do with your life? Where and when did you know you would be a writer?\n\nI always wanted to be around stories and I loved TV and movies. I went to school for screenwriting, and I wasn't a success as a screenwriter. Right after school I got a job at a soap opera magazine (no kidding), and the people there thought I was a terrible writer and told me so all the time. None of that deterred me, so I guess I always felt like this was what I was going to do. We think of writing as so rarefied and elite, but that's a narrative created by writers. Most of us are probably doing this because we weren't that good at math or science. In my school and in my family, other skills were certainly more valued. There were advanced classes for math and science in my school, but not for writing. What I'm trying to say, not particularly well, is that the barriers didn't feel high to me because where I was sitting, this was not a respected career. Luckily, I had not yet read the writers who totally blow my mind by then. By the time I read them, I was already working, so cowering in intimidation was not an option -- at least not a public option. I still do it privately.",

In Campanile's four seasons in Miami, the Dolphins gave up an average of 4.2 yards per carry (10th in the NFL) and 106.4 yards per game rushing, the sixth-best mark in that span.\n\nCampanile spent six seasons as a high school coach in New Jersey, including five seasons at Don Bosco Prep -- three as defensive coordinator, two as offensive coordinator -- before joining Rutgers as a defensive assistant in 2012. He also coached tight ends and receivers in his four seasons at Rutgers.\n\nCampanile also spent three seasons at Boston College (2016-18) and one at Michigan before joining Brian Flores' staff in Miami.",

    "raw_text": "The Hockey India League will soon enter its final stretch with men's and women's teams pushing to make their way into the knockouts. Almost all the men's teams have played each other once, except for the postponed Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers vs JSW Soorma Hockey Club match. The next league phase has started on Sunday where teams will play the others in the same pool, which means each team has three more matches (four in the case of Shrachi and Soorma) remaining before the knockouts start.\n\nAhead of the crucial week in the HIL, here's how things stand in both the leagues:\n\nTeams which have impressed\n\nTamil Nadu Dragons top the men's standings with 15 points from seven matches, with just one outright loss so far. The big positive for Dragons is that they didn't take too long to gel as a team. With an effective dragflick specialist in Jip Janssen, who has scored five goals so far, and a solid backline led by captain Amit Rohidas, the Dragons have shown remarkable consistency until their loss against Hyderabad Toofans. Barring a terrible loss of form, the Dragons will finish in the top four.\n\nThe Toofans themselves have benefited from having proper goal-scorers. Gonzalo Peillat has scored five from penalty corners while Tim Brand has four field goals to his name. Also, their Indian players have shown great promise.\n\nAlthough Kalinga Lancers have been a bit inconsistent, they have scored the most goals in the tournament - 25 in eight matches. They have Thierry Brinkman who is leading the charts with eight field goals and dragflicker Alexander Hendrickx with six penalty corner goals. The way they bounced back from a 2-5 goal deficit to make it 5-5 against Delhi SG Pipers on Sunday and then clinched the bonus point in the shootout showed their firepower at their best. If they continue their goal-scoring form, they are not going to miss out from making their way to the semifinals.\n\nIn the women's league, Janneke Schopman's Odisha Warriors are clearly the team to beat, despite suffering a loss against Soorma. They have the best penalty corner specialist in Yibbi Jansen who scored four goals already as the team leads the table after four matches. Soorma have been the next best, with an impressive start, including two wins and a loss in three matches. While the Warriors will most likely go through to the final, the other three teams, including Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers and Delhi SG Pipers still have a decent chance to challenge for the title.\n\nPlayers who impressed\n\nThe usual big foreign names have made their impact. Brinkman has been outstanding along with Hendrickx, Peillat and Janssen. Arthur van Doren has been a massive influence at the back as well as going forward for the Lancers while forward Nathan Ephraums also played his part with three goals for the Dragons.\n\nAmong Indian players, Abhishek's form has been good for the Bengal Tigers while for the same team, Jugraj Singh has scored five penalty corner goals. Jugraj scoring goals is not only a big positive for Bengal Tigers but also for the national team. There's a clear need for him to go a level up, especially with his dragflick. If he can do it in the HIL and maintain the form, he can become a valuable second option for penalty corners behind Harmanpreet Singh for the national team.\n\nStaying with penalty corners, Amandeep Lakra also made his mark with two goals for the Toofans. The 22-year-old has got a solid technique and power, which is of course good news for India's future. Apart from Amandeep, the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Talwinder Singh, Rajinder Singh, and Shilanand Lakra have played pivotal roles in Toofans' good run so far. It will be a great story not only for the team but also for the league if Toofans can go all the way on the back of the performances of their Indian core.\n\nAmong women, Odisha's Jansen has stood out which is, to be honest, not a surprise at all. However, for the same team, Baljeet Kaur has impressed with her attacking play, also scoring two goals. Sonam, who's just 19, has also contributed with two goals for Soorma.\n\nPredictions\n\nIn the men's league, Tamil Nadu Dragons, Hyderabad Toofans and Vedanta Kalinga Lancers look good to qualify for the knockouts. The fourth place fight will be between UP Rudras, Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers and Soorma Hockey Club.\n\nTeam Gonasika and Delhi SG Pipers will need something special to make it after struggling in the league. In fact, Graham Reid's Delhi are still searching for their full three points after eight matches.\n\nIn the women's league, Odisha and Soorma are favourites to battle for the title.",

    "raw_text": "Editor's note: This story contains mature content.\n\nSo what's it like?\" I ask Eugene Monroe.\n\n\"What's it like?\" He's working out in his basement. The music is loud. From some kind of high-tech rack, he's picking up dumbbells that appear immobile in their sheer mass but yield to his grip like Excalibur.\n\n\"Yeah, what's it like?\"\n\nIt's not much of question straight. But then, I'm not straight. Neither is Monroe. He comes over and wipes his face with a towel.\n\n\"It's one of those experiences you have to go through to understand,\" he says. \"I could use as many words as I could find to describe it, but the feeling it produces, I don't think we have a word for it.\"\n\nI sit there, nodding, listening to the music. It takes me awhile to ask, \"So what does it sound like?\"\n\nHe's doing curls and finishes his set before answering. He is an enormous human being, deliberate and unhurried in his movements and his speech.\n\n\"You know that crisp sound where you're watching an Olympic diver hit the water, where it's like a blade slicing through the water? Well, you have that smooth, clean sound, and at the same time it's like someone has a sawed-off shotgun -- pow! It's amazing.\"\n\nI nod again, wondering whether he has the best insights into football I've heard, or just the best weed I've smoked. \"Do you see things out there that, like, you can't explain? Things that, like, defy gravity?\"\n\nBecause he's sitting down, I can see crinkles start spreading across his shaved and sopping scalp. \"I've played with some very good players,\" he says. \"And the way we blocked some guys ... you shouldn't be able to do that to people. I mean, it's not right -- and it doesn't exist anywhere else but on the field. I mean, really disrespecting and hurting people.\"\n\nAnd then a pause. \"It was awesome.\"\n\nMonroe is a very serious man, with a very serious cause. He generally speaks in a commanding monotone even when he's joking, and he is relentlessly on message. Now, though, he begins to laugh, and so do I, because I've always wanted to know what professional football is really like, in the middle of the maelstrom, and now I do:\n\nIt's like drugs, man.\n\nTHIS IS A story about addiction. It's also a story about getting high. They're not the same thing. The first is not necessarily the result of the second. The second, it turns out, can be a way to deal with the first. Eugene Monroe knew too much about addiction growing up. But he did not know about getting high because the addictions he saw all around him taught him to decline all drugs, including marijuana. He played football instead. He played football because football kept him clean; because football required him to be healthy; because football forced him to control himself and permitted him to control others, reveling in the size of his body and his will. He played football for 18 years, and when he got hurt -- when football hurt him -- he always came back and kept playing. When he couldn't keep playing without taking drugs, he took the drugs team doctors gave him. He always followed the rules, even when he began to realize that the rules about drugs didn't make any sense ... indeed, even when he became the first active player in the history of his sport to challenge the rules in public. He ended up getting cut from his team. He ended up losing his faith in football and then quitting it altogether, before it could hurt him again. He ended up losing the thing he loved, and now he has ended up sitting on his patio with a vaporizer pen and a bong while his diapered toddlers gaze at him through the window from inside the house. It is, in a way, the end he always feared, when he was growing up, wary of drugs, except that the drug he's using has given him what people always want from drugs and rarely get: a way out. He is no longer addicted to football. He is, at long last, just high.\n\nTHE FIRST THING to remember about getting high is that it's never just about getting high. The second thing is that it's always just about getting high. Right? You get high and you think that, like, brushing your teeth is so inherently interesting that you can do it for half an hour. Then you look in the mirror and see the dude brushing his teeth for half an hour and you're like, \"Oh, right -- you're just high.\"\n\nThe thing about Monroe, though, is that he's never just getting high, even when he's out on the patio on a hot summer evening and he's holding the vape pen in one hand and the little chattering bong in the other, and the difference in scale between him and his paraphernalia makes him look like a kindly genie trying to climb back into his bottle. He rarely even calls it getting high; he prefers to say that he's \"medicating\" or \"taking my medicine\" or, most often, using or consuming cannabis. After all, he didn't just get hurt playing football. He hurts. \"I wake up in the morning and my back hurts,\" he says. \"And my feet hurt. And my neck hurts. And my knee hurts. My shoulder hurts, and sometimes my hands ache too. And this is every day ...\" You can see it when he assumes his customary back-saving posture, sitting with both legs stretched out before him, his surgically graffitied left knee on display. And you can hear it when he indulges in his habit of twisting his neck and it answers with a crunching sound, gravel where the ball bearings should be.\n\nSo Monroe isn't, like, Laremy Tunsil in a gas mask, dorm-room-smoker-turned-draft-day-punchline -- and NFL object lesson -- thanks to the magic of social media. He works out twice a day, volcanically hard, and he gets high before his workouts because it enables him to work through the teeth of his chronic pain. He gets high because after years and years of taking the wrong medicines, he says he has finally found the right medicine in marijuana. He gets high because he has suffered several concussions, and he is convinced by the research that suggests marijuana can help save his brain. He gets high because he has decided to put his health and his family first after a career that required him to sacrifice both. And when he gets high, his vape pen and bong remind him of the most considered and consequential decision of his life. So when he asks, \"Do you want to partake ...\"\n\nPartake -- one of the great weedy words, especially the way Monroe says it, in that deep deadpan that puts one in mind of Ving Rhames playing, like, a conscientious objector. Eugene consumes cannabis all day long, but he's not getting high all day long. With his food, he takes something called CBD hemp oil, which is low in THC (the ingredient in marijuana that gets you high) and high in cannabidiol (the ingredient in marijuana that's supposed to get you well). He extols the powers of selective botany, particularly as manifested in strains of marijuana that make you feel good \"without the euphoria.\" For tonight's pre-workout ritual on the patio, however, he has chosen a strain that former lineman Kyle Turley suggested at a golf tournament fundraiser for a study of marijuana as a treatment for signs of CTE. It's called \"Jack Herer,\" and Eugene, when he nimbly feeds the vape pen into the bong with long fingers as twisty as the roots of old trees, is definitely partaking in it. He hands me the vape pen, tells me to \"just press the button,\" and when I do, \"the Jack,\" as he calls it, hits my lungs like a fist that opens into a hand waving goodbye, and I begin coughing from somewhere around my kneecaps. \"That was a big hit, man,\" he says, with raised eyebrow, and he heads for his basement to begin his workout.\n\n\u0093I used to believe in those commercials -- \u2018This is your brain, this is your brain on drugs.\u2019 For years, I never considered having anything to do with it.\u0094\n\n- Eugene Monroe\n\nIN 1982, THE NFL and the NFL Players Association negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that formally prohibited players from using marijuana -- that, indeed, gave marijuana the same standing as heroin, insofar as the danger it presented. The policy granted the league broad powers to test players for the drug's presence within their bodies, and to treat and discipline those who tested positive. To this day, the NFL remains arguably the most restrictive of all American professional sports leagues in regard to marijuana. Major League Baseball, for example, doesn't discipline for it beyond fines for excessive positive tests, while the NHL tests only one-third of its players each year.\n\nIt took 34 years for an active player to challenge the NFL's policy, and when one finally did, he was such an unlikely candidate for the job that everybody he informed of his plans remembers the exact moment when he broke the news.\n\n\"The conversation began at 10:30, and we were on the phone until 2:30 in the morning,\" says Monroe's agent, Sunny Shah. \"It got pretty heated. I wanted him to understand fully the ramifications -- and that you can't always control what others think and that others may judge you for your stance.\"\n\nIt wasn't just that Monroe was about to risk his career. It wasn't even that Monroe was about to risk his career advocating for a drug he didn't use at the time. It was that he still loved football. He still wanted to play football. He was 28 years old. He had been the eighth pick in the 2009 NFL draft and had just finished his seventh season in the NFL. He was a left tackle, one of the most lucrative positions in the league. He had made over $17 million in his first two full years with the Ravens and was due to make an additional $6.5 million if the team kept him on the roster. He had ended the 2015 season on injured reserve and had undergone shoulder surgery. But he was rehabbing his shoulder and working out every day in anticipation of putting his injuries behind him. He was in his prime. Yet on March 9, 2016, he gave an interview to CNN for a report titled \"Is it time for football to reconsider marijuana?\" He said that it was time and that the NFL should start researching the efficacy of marijuana as an alternative to addictive opioid painkillers such as Vicodin and Oxycontin.\n\nHe didn't know it at the time, but he had played his last down in the NFL.\n\nIT WAS, LIKE, the first high he ever experienced. He was 11 years old, the youngest of 16 children. His mother battled an addiction to crack cocaine. His father had just died. He was, he says, \"one of the biggest kids in Plainfield, New Jersey, but not one of the most athletic,\" and football transformed him. In sixth grade, he joined a Pop Warner team and went from being one of the kids picked last to a kid who put other kids on the ground, every play. \"I was laying people out,\" he says, \"and being highly appreciated for it.\"\n\nSo he got hooked. He got hooked on the game -- the adrenaline, the violence, the absolute license of it, the intricacies unfolding all around that no one can know about unless you stand right in the middle of them -- and he stayed hooked even when, inevitably, he got hurt. In a spring practice in pads in preparation for his sophomore season at the University of Virginia, he dislocated his left kneecap and ruptured his patellar retinaculum. His knee had to be grafted back together when he was 19, and it was never the same. \"It made me grow up quick,\" he says. \"It taught me what it was like to really work for something, and it redefined me as a player.\" His mind had always been part of his life; now he made it part of his game. \"No matter where I was on campus, I'd be thinking. In my dorm, in my apartment, at the bus stop, I'd be thinking, trying to figure out what angles certain defenders would take. I was so ingrained in becoming excellent. It was part of my existence. And it showed on the field.\"\n\nOf course, to stay on the field after an injury like that, well, you don't think it's just a matter of grit and perseverance, do you? No -- it's a matter of drugs, the whole dizzying pharmacopoeia that makes our weekend entertainments possible. Players can't play without them. Monroe couldn't play without them. He started taking them in college, when he was recovering from the reconstruction of his knee, and he kept taking them when he played for the Jaguars and the Ravens. On Sundays, he stood in line for injections of the anti-inflammatory Toradol, and the rest of the time he took the pills the team doctors and surgeons prescribed for him. A 10-year prescription for the anti-inflammatory Celebrex; another for the gastric distress the Celebrex caused; another for Ambien, when he was too jacked up or in too much pain to sleep; another for the migraines caused by his concussions; and then the prescriptions for pain, Vicodin and Oxycontin, when he was either trying to forestall surgery or trying to recover from it. His intake wasn't out of the ordinary. It was typical, and so was the fact that it got him high.\n\n\"Those drugs, they stone you,\" Monroe says. \"They have psychoactive components. If you get a bottle of any opioid drug, it warns you not to drive, not to operate any heavy machinery. They cause drowsiness and fatigue; they cause lethargy. But we don't like to talk about that.\"\n\nAnd that's the thing you have to remember when you hear debates about marijuana and the NFL, and especially when you hear the anecdotal estimate that half the players in the NFL regularly smoke weed. It's not that they're choosing to get high.\n\nIt's that they already are.\n\nHERE'S HOW MONROE met his wife, Nureya: She needed a ride. She was a freshman at Virginia, heading home to the suburbs of Baltimore for the weekend but late for her bus. She stopped the first person who drove by, and it was Eugene, on his way to deliver a paper to one of his professors. She didn't know who he was -- didn't know that he played football -- and as soon as she sat down, she demanded his name and called two friends to say who she was with, in case anything happened to her. Eugene talked the entire ride about his love for Japanese anime. \"We kept talking,\" Nureya says, \"and never stopped.\"\n\nSo she knows a lot about Eugene -- knows a lot about what made him \"a little different\" in the estimation of his coaches and the reporters who covered him. At 6-foot-5 and 300 pounds, with long arms and what draft experts called a \"thick lower body,\" he might have been a \"prototypical left tackle\" in regard to his dimensions but never in regard to his temperament. Teams want their linemen to be \"nasty,\" but Monroe is typically described as \"soft-spoken,\" \"thoughtful\" and even \"philosophical\" -- \"a nerd.\" Nureya knew better because she knew how intense he could be, how \"when he believes in something, everybody has to believe it\", how friends who argued with him wound up calling him \"Google\" because he knew everything. She knew how badly he needed a cause, a fight, to be a warrior, and how deeply football satisfied that need.\n\nShe also knew -- she was the only one who knew -- how badly football had hurt him. She was on intimate terms not only with him but with his pain. Indeed, Monroe's life with his family was largely about pain. \"It's the morning after the game, and he wakes up and can hardly move,\" she says. \"Or he wakes up in the middle of the night and he'll be screaming out, asking me to run and give him water and a Tylenol, it's hurting so bad. Or he's forcing himself into the ice tub, telling me to get him ice and Epsom salts. Or he's trying to play with the kids, and I know how much he's hurting, I know that he's bummed out because he can't pick up our son, Xavier. Knowing that he hit 300-pound guys, for him to say 'I can't lift my son up' ... there was like a thought: 'Is that how it's going to be in 15 years, is that where this ends, he can't play with his kids because of the things he has to do to play football?'\"\n\nAnd yet what she couldn't have known, what she couldn't guess, what she couldn't even have imagined, was the cause he would choose. It was something they agreed on back in college: \"I had family members who experienced the negative effects of drugs in their lives, and so had Eugene. He had always been like, 'That's not me ...'\"\n\nAnd for the longest time, it wasn't. \"Drugs were huge in the community where I grew up,\" Monroe says. \"People using them, people selling them, people being arrested for them because they were associated with them. All sorts of drugs came through my house, and I saw some things I'll never forget. It was all right in front of me, and I became averse to them because I saw how damaging they were.\" Even marijuana: \"I used to believe, literally, in those commercials -- 'This is your brain, this is your brain on drugs,'\" he says. \"Your brain is some eggs frying in a pan ... and if you smoke marijuana, that's what happens. For years I never considered having anything to do with it. I just thought it was dangerous.\" And it wasn't just marijuana itself he feared; it was the NFL. When one of his roommates in Jacksonville got high, he used to cover his face and go outside until the dreaded ritual had ended. \"I was always afraid of failing the test, tarnishing my name. A failed test is a huge hit on your character in the NFL world.\"\n\nAnd then one day ... well, you might think he got high and then everything changed. But that's not what happened. Eugene being Eugene -- a guy who gives endless and even agonized consideration to what turn out to be snap decisions -- he watched a documentary on getting high, and then everything changed. Reported by Dr. Sanjay Gupta for CNN, it was called Weed, and it told the stories of families braving opposition so that they could use marijuana to treat the intractable illnesses of their children. Monroe, who would soon be traded from Jacksonville to Baltimore, recognized himself in it because he too had an intractable illness: He made his living playing football. He had always done everything he could to stay on the field, at one point spending his own money on stem cell injections for his ruined left knee, a procedure then considered experimental. Now he began going online to read everything he could about the benefits of marijuana, and eventually he had a talk with his agent, with NFLPA director DeMaurice Smith and with Nureya. \"When Eugene started discussing changing how marijuana is perceived, I was like, 'Hold on -- you're the health advocate, there's no way this can fall in line with that,'\" she says.\n\nThat was seven months ago. He was committed then; he's, like, enlightened now. He's Saul on the road to the dispensary. He's part househusband and part bodhisattva. \"I am having time to learn who I am,\" he says. Nureya says it best: \"Cannabis has given Eugene a stone he can use to kill many birds.\" And what has it given her, in exchange for accepting a lifestyle she never foresaw? It has given her what Eugene has been fighting to be all along: a husband not defined by pain, a father who can play with their three children.\n\nIT IS DIFFICULT playing with pain. It is harder still not being able to play and having to live with doubt. Ask Monroe about his worst time in football and he doesn't mention the injuries that never really went away and so changed his body and his life. He talks about the injury that changed his relationship to his team.\n\nIt was a high ankle sprain, a sometimes crippling injury often prefaced with the word \"nagging.\" He suffered it at the end of the 2014 season, when the Ravens were making a playoff run. The team doctor cleared him to play in the first game of the playoffs, but he remembers being \"barely able to walk, much less run, much less push off.\" He sought a second opinion, the advice of his own doctor, and did not suit up for the Ravens' wild-card win over the Steelers. Against New England in the next round, Baltimore's coaches played him on special teams and not at left tackle. \"It felt like punishment,\" he says. Baltimore lost.\n\nThe Ravens declined to answer any questions about Monroe. But a reporter who covers the team identified the high ankle sprain as the turning point of Monroe's years in Baltimore. He'd started the season signing a contract extension that gave him $17.5 million guaranteed; now the Ravens began to doubt not just his \"nastiness\" but his very love of the game. It is, in the world of the NFL, a serious accusation, hurled against a player's very essence, and Monroe answers with vehemence: \"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and I've yet to have anyone from the team come to me and express that man-to-man.\"\n\nSix months later, Monroe entered the marijuana business. Maryland had recently legalized medical marijuana, and Pete Kadens, partner in an Illinois-based cultivator and distributor called Green Thumb Industries, was looking for local investors. By this time, Monroe was more than just a football player, he was a man who saw \"a business opportunity in an industry where there's not only a high level of growth but also a chance to provide something for people who need it ... who are suffering, who have to decompress, who need cannabis. Philosophically, it made sense. Everything I stand for is there.\"\n\nKadens asked, \"How many players feel like you do?\" Monroe said, \"A lot.\"\n\n\"We wound up talking to some high-level players -- very high-level players,\" Kadens says. \"But after three weeks they'd fall off the face of the earth and never come back.\"\n\nMonroe never worked harder on his body than he did before the 2015 season. \"I wanted to demonstrate that I was the guy the Ravens signed, that I was the guy they thought they were getting,\" he says. He spent most of his NFL career at 330 pounds; now, by concentrating on diet and fitness, he was down to 285. At the same time, he began investing in medical marijuana dispensaries in Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Nevada. He did not tell the Ravens or the NFL. He did not believe his business was any of their business, and he began the 2015 season at the fulcrum of two apparently opposing forces: expecting to dominate on the field and believing he had begun to find his way off it.\n\nAnd then, in the first drive of the Ravens' first game of the season against the Broncos, he got his mind altered, NFL-style.\n\n\"HOW'S THE YAKITORI chicken?\" Monroe asks me.\n\n\"What?\" I'm not eating yakitori chicken. I'm not eating anything. I've followed Monroe in from the patio, and now I'm sitting in his basement, watching him work out.\n\n\"How's the Jack in the Box?\"\n\n\"What?\" I'm not eating Jack in the Box. I mean, like, I could eat. But still ...\n\nMonroe walks over, bathed in sweat and beneficence. \"I said, 'How's the Jack treating you?'\" Oh, right, the Jack.\n\n\"Excellent,\" I say. \"Excellent.\"\n\nFor all of Monroe's enthusiasm for strains of marijuana that don't get you high, Jack Herer is not one of them. It is, instead, a strain of marijuana that makes you realize the difference between just getting high and getting high for a reason that goes well beyond the euphoria, maybe even well beyond the enlightenment. I'm entertained that Eugene has turned his unfinished basement into, like, one vast dorm room, with two tall floor speakers pounding out nihilistic rap music chosen by his teenage cousins from New Jersey, his teenage cousins from New Jersey crowding a sectional couch and playing video games on a large-screen TV, a beanbag chair on the floor the size of a bed and a fully made bed flanked by a nightstand on which sits a bong and a Volcano Vaporizer, and even the foil on the exposed insulation gleaming like the foil on the fabled walls of Andy Warhol's The Factory. Monroe, on the other hand, has chosen to use the Jack because it energizes him for his workouts, and now, by god, he works out as if to demonstrate its power. He wants to slim down and shed his NFL-sized body for a civilian one. But he works out like an NFL player, works out as if to prove he can still play in the NFL, works out so hard he leaves puddles on the floor, works out as if to express how much he misses football, how much the longing still resides in his muscles and lingers in his cells.\n\nHis phone rings. It's his trainer, a former college player named Andre Washington, and he begins chiding Monroe for retiring.\n\n\"You just an old washed-up player, just like me,\" Washington says.\n\n\"I don't know about that, man. I got my film. You got your film? Let's compare film.\"\n\n\"You come on over, we'll just start talking about them old memories ...\"\n\n\"I know I got my film. I don't know about you ...\"\n\n\"Oh, I know, I know,\" Washington says, with sincerity suddenly softening his voice. \"You could still be out there, if you hadn't taken the stand you took.\"\n\n\"I'd be somewhere starting tackle,\" Monroe says. \"Easily.\"\n\n\"But you're doing something revolutionary. I talk about you all the time. You stood up for a cause. A great cause.\"\n\n\"I knew it would be risky,\" Monroe says. \"But creating a safer medical environment for players, reducing the number of pills prescribed, that meant a lot to me, because I was still living to play, and I didn't want to keep taking pills to deal with pain ...\"\n\nAnd here, Eugene Monroe begins telling his story to a good friend who already knows it. But Andre encourages it: \"I tell you, man, I could not be more proud of you, you're still up for something great, of that magnitude, and that's a pretty awesome story to tell for a football player.\" And, hearing an echo of intervention, I finally begin to understand. The trainer he relies on to push and inspire him is no longer working to help Monroe stay in the NFL. He is working to help him stay out.\n\nMONROE GOT HIT in the head. He knows that much; he's seen that much on the film. But he has no memory of what happened when the Ravens played the Broncos in the first game of the 2015 season. His only memory is of what happened afterward, his two weeks in the black chrysalis of concussion, his slow emergence into the pain of the light. He remembers wobbling down the hallway of his hotel the next morning as he made his way to the team doctor. He remembers the \"constant headaches -- a little man, squeezing my head all day long.\" He remembers the pills he was given, and how they didn't work. And he remembers Nureya's terror of his isolation, terror of him recoiling from light, sound, touch.\n\nHe came back. But then he tore his labrum, and the season dissolved into a montage of pain and pills. He ended it on injured reserve and underwent shoulder surgery in December. He went home with a prescription for Vicodin, but the pills made him feel groggy and listless. He had never liked the way opioids made him feel, had never liked the opiate high. Now, in the aftermath of the concussion, he couldn't tolerate it: \"I was sitting there practically drooling, thinking this was not a good idea.\" Six days after his operation, he stopped taking not only the Vicodin but all the other pills stocked in his medicine cabinet. He could endure pain more easily than he could the reminders and harbingers of addiction.\n\nHe expected to keep playing football. His agent had told him he might be released because of his difficulty staying on the field -- and because the Ravens would soon owe him another year's salary if they kept him. And so, Eugene being Eugene, he began to contemplate talking about marijuana, figuring that he'd have more impact as a member of the Ravens than he would as a Ravens castoff. The night before he gave his first interview, he called Pete Kadens of Green Thumb. \"It came out of left field,\" Kadens says. \"He said, 'This is what I'm doing.' I was like, 'Seriously, man?' He said, 'This is it, man. I can't stand by idly anymore, watching guys destroy their bodies with the wrong medicine ...'\"\n\nIt was his strategy from the start: to broaden the terms of the debate. He would talk not just about the NFL's marijuana policy but also about its legacy of chronic traumatic encephalopathy; not just about the state-by-state relaxation and repeal of marijuana laws but about the national epidemic of opioid addiction. He never spoke about getting high because he wasn't yet getting high. He spoke instead about marijuana as an alternative to addictive painkillers -- as an alternative to something that was dangerous, something that led to enslavement and overdoses and lives thrown away. And once he started, he never stopped.\n\n\"DOES THE NFL have a marijuana problem?\" I ask Jeff Miller, the NFL's executive VP for health and safety.\n\n\"We have a program for testing jointly negotiated with the players' association on the advice of our medical advisers,\" he answers. \"We test players, and should they test positive they hopefully get the kind of help and assistance they need. If they repeatedly test positive, there are punishments for it.\"\n\nIt is the answer he gives, with variations, the entire interview. The issue of marijuana has already been dealt with in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement with the NFLPA. Yes, state laws and public perception regarding marijuana seem to be changing rapidly. And yes, the league has said it is open to further research. But until the NFL's medical advisers see a need to change the policy, the policy will stay as it is -- \"a policy consistent with prevailing medical opinion and federal law.\"\n\nAnd, in a way, Miller is right. The NFL doesn't have a marijuana problem. It has, like, five. The first is that an awful lot of its players ignore or find ways to get around league policy and get high. The second is that because so many players get high, the policy is widely regarded as a joke, even by league officials speaking off the record. The third is that the policy causes many players to lose weeks, months and even years of their already short-lived careers. The fourth is that despite -- or because of -- its restrictive policies, the NFL has become crucial to the cause of legalization, a wellspring of pro-marijuana advocacy and activism.\n\nAnd the fifth? The fifth of the NFL's marijuana problems is that it's the least of the NFL's problems. The gravest, of course, is the increasing awareness that playing football is inherently dangerous -- matched by an increasing reluctance of many players to brave the risks and keep playing it. Eugene Monroe is not just the first active player to challenge the league's marijuana policy; he is one of a dozen or so players who retired this past offseason though they had been performing at a high level. Like Monroe, they had tired of playing with pain, had come to fear the next injury, worried about the game's long-term effects on their bodies and their brains, had families to think about and had enough money to get out. What distinguished Monroe from the likes of Calvin Johnson and Marshawn Lynch was that although they might have been saying that the NFL was dangerous, he was somehow driven to say, again and again, that the NFL was demonstrably more dangerous than marijuana.\n\nWHEN YOU'RE AN American kid, wondering whether you should get high, you hear about the \"slippery slope.\" Give in to one thing and you're on your way to something else, sliding toward an unforeseen end. Once he started speaking out about marijuana, Monroe was on a slippery slope uniquely his own. He didn't just speak, he wrote checks. He wrote checks and challenged his fellow players to do the same. He wrote a check to an organization called Doctors for Cannabis Regulation, providing what board member Dr. Sue Sisley calls \"seed money,\" when it was broke. He provided a service dog for Brian Schaefering, an NFL veteran who suffered from extreme memory loss and advocated for marijuana. He visited Realm of Caring, a nonprofit organization, and found out that it was sponsoring a Johns Hopkins study into how many players are using marijuana and why. He asked what its fundraising goals were, then fulfilled them. \"He was talking about donating $80,000,\" says Realm of Caring's CEO, Heather Jackson. \"We tried to convince him not to ... but Eugene would not be swayed.\"\n\nHe never got in trouble for his activism. He just got cut. On June 15, three months after his first interview about marijuana, the Ravens released him, describing it as due to \"football circumstances.\" He began hearing from other teams. \"It was definitely Eugene's choice to keep playing,\" says his agent, Sunny Shah. But it was also Monroe's choice to force a confrontation with the NFL by applying for what is called a \"therapeutic use exemption\" -- the same exception to the prohibition on banned substances that allows players with ADHD to use Adderall. \"We had the paperwork all filled out,\" Sisley says.\n\n\"And then,\" she says, \"the day before we were getting ready to submit, he's out.\"\n\n\"The Giants had offered me a deal to come and play, and so did the 49ers,\" Monroe says. \"But I was looking for a reason to play when I knew I shouldn't. I was trying to legitimize stepping back on the field.\"\n\nAnd so on July 21, he announced his retirement in an essay for The Players' Tribune titled \"Leaving the Game I Love.\"\n\nThe slope had been slippery indeed. Now he was free to go out to his patio and to make a life out of what he once feared.\n\nTHIS IS THE story of Eugene Monroe, full-time marijuana advocate and entrepreneur. He is now a partner in Green Thumb Industries, and marijuana has become not only his cause but his livelihood. He partnered with Green Thumb in opening a medical marijuana dispensary in Carson City, Nevada, calling it Rise and styling it as a spa where people can come and relax. He is the official \"athletics ambassador\" for Doctors for Cannabis Regulation, and in September he was the lead signatory of an open letter the organization sent to the NFL formally requesting that the league reconsider its marijuana policy. He is, Sisley says, \"of all the activists, unique. He's fearless, but he's also a diplomat. Even if you don't agree with him, he's so even-keeled he neutralizes all his opponents.\"\n\nMore Pin Kings\n\nStreaming\n\nStream Pin Kings on WatchESPN and on the app beginning Aug. 19.\n\nPodcast\n\nCheck out our 16-episode podcast.

But no ending is inevitable, and courage and commitment are always open to questions from the unconverted. Is it possible that Monroe began changing his life in response to a CNN documentary, or was there something in him, in his wiring or in his past, that whispered, \"Yes, this is the way\"? His advocacy at first took the form of investment -- is it possible that his advocacy grew out of his investments and that he is as much an opportunist as he is a figure of enlightenment? Did he improvise his exit, or did he execute it, planning and pursuing an endgame even as his coaches and teammates believed that he believed only in them? Did he end up simply exchanging one high for another? Did he replace his football problem with a marijuana problem? Did he retire because he feared another concussion, or did he retire because he finally started getting high and couldn't pass the drug test? Could he pass another drug test even if he wanted to, or is the point that he knew he would want to ... and arranged his life so he could pass every test but that one?\n\nCertainly, his commitment has been tested, as a football player and as a cannabist. The dislocated knee. The concussion. The pills he turned away from. The decision to go public. The release by the Ravens. The tempting offers from two teams. The retirement. All those times he watches a game on TV and tells himself and anyone within earshot that he could still be playing. He has never wavered; at each test he keeps on his path, away from football and toward the freedom of the patio and the embrace of his family.\n\nBut he had never been tested the way he was on Oct. 17, when his commitment to family complicated his commitment to cause. He had grown up with a mother he loved despite the tumult caused by her use of crack cocaine. Indeed, he remembered her example when he was trying to balance being a father and being an offensive tackle in the NFL. \"I tried to give everything I could to my family, but it was always about picking up the pieces,\" he says. He refused to give Nureya and the children a life full of shards, so he retired into a life of tempered purpose until the day his aunt called from home and he found out how badly his mother was still broken.\n\nIt wasn't that he didn't know. He had always known -- when I asked him to describe how long Stephanie Green Monroe has been struggling with drugs, he answered, softly and after a long pause, \"It has been a lifetime.\" But he had thought that, at the age of 55, she had put the worst of it behind her. Then one of his cousins went to her home after not hearing from her. He found her on the bathroom floor. She had overdosed on heroin and had hit her head when she fell. His cousin called an ambulance, and his aunt called Eugene.\n\nHe was on his way to one of the grow houses used by Green Thumb, for the photo shoot associated with this story. His mother had survived and was in a hospital. Now he had to decide what to do -- whether to keep his commitments at the grow house or turn around and go home. He also had to decide what the news meant to him and to his cause. \"Here I've been putting my neck out,\" he said, when I called him. \"And bam -- it hits me.\" And what had hit him? Opioids. Addiction. The very things he'd been fighting against. What had happened was personal, but it wasn't only personal -- \"It wasn't really about my background.\" It was about something much larger, \"a problem everyone has around the country. No one is immune to the effects.\"\n\nAnd yet ... his mother had almost died. She almost died of a drug overdose, and her son was deeply invested in legitimizing a drug that many Americans still regard as dangerous. He was not just the first active NFL player to challenge the NFL's marijuana policy, he was the first retired NFL player to attempt predicating his livelihood on the moral authority conferred by NFL survivorship. Even those who disagreed with him about the medicinal benefits of marijuana could surely see the need to find alternatives to opioids. What would they say, though, now that his mother had almost died from heroin? Would they bring up the slippery slope? Would they try to draw a line between his patio outside Baltimore and his mother's home in New Jersey? Could they possibly understand that for him marijuana offered not a way into addiction but rather a way out of a sport that had a hold on him, body and soul?\n\n\"I've seen my fair share of incidences like this,\" he said. \"But it's different when it's personal. It's testing me at this moment, and it will continue to do so.\" But he didn't have a choice. He was certain that marijuana helped people because he was certain it helped him. \"I know I'm doing the right thing,\" he said. \"People don't need to go through this. And if I know that something can prevent this from happening, why would anyone oppose it?\"\n\nBy \"this,\" he was referring to his mother's experience with heroin. He was referring to the entire cycle of pain and pull and need and habit from which he'd spent his whole life trying to escape. Did the grow house in Illinois promise a cure? Of course the problem was much more complicated than that. But in the grow house flourished something that at the very least promised relief, and so the choice Eugene faced was no choice at all. His mother was back east, in New Jersey. He loved his mother. But she was already surrounded by family, and Nureya was on her way from Baltimore to visit the hospital. Eugene would be able to join her in a day or two. But everything else lay before him -- not just the photo shoot but the opportunity it represented. He was not about to turn around. He kept going west, where the future he fought for somehow managed to keep growing, like a weed.\n\nTom JunodBefore joining ESPN as a senior writer, Junod wrote for Esquire and GQ.

    "raw_text": "WHAT KENNEDY WAS doing was all he ever wanted to do. \"Billy was unlike a lot of us,\" NBA referee Monty McCutchen says. \"He knew when he was 10, 12 and 14 years old that he wanted to be an NBA ref.\"\n\nIn his early teen years in Phoenix, Kennedy would flip on the Suns' pregame radio broadcasts in the one-bedroom apartment he shared with his mother in the central city. If play-by-play man Al McCoy announced Tommy Nunez Sr. as one of the officials working the game, Kennedy would jump on his bicycle and zoom down to Veterans Memorial Coliseum in 15 minutes. There, a security guard named Mary Lou, charmed by a young Kennedy, would let him through the back gate.\n\nNunez, who refers to Kennedy as \"my son,\" was a strong presence at the two most influential institutions in Kennedy's youth: the Boys & Girls Club and St. Mary's Catholic High School. With Kennedy's mother working multiple jobs to scrape together the money to send him to St. Mary's and Kennedy's father often absent from his life, the Boys & Girls Club was where Kennedy spent his time after school. And when, on a Saturday in 1978, the 8- and 9-year-olds at the club needed a referee, the 12-year-old Kennedy stepped in -- and a referee was born.\n\nKennedy quickly piled up assignments, and officiating soon became far more than a chance to earn five bucks; it was a compulsion. When he wasn't officiating games, he attached himself to Nunez. After Suns home games when Nunez was officiating, Kennedy would tag along with him and his officiating partner to the China Doll restaurant on 7th Avenue, where the crew would debrief its performance, talking shop until the place closed down after midnight. \"He had an Afro and these big glasses and teeth,\" said Nunez's son Tommy Jr., a former NBA ref who often joined his father for dinner and is seven years older than Kennedy. \"He'd come right over and he'd be sitting right there, this little kid, right in the middle of everything.\"\n\nBy the time he reached high school, Kennedy was a fixture in Phoenix's tight-knit referee community. By 17, Kennedy, after reffing a slate of high school basketball and football games on Friday nights, would wake early on Saturday mornings for a busy dance card of Pop Warner games. By 20, he was working the junior college circuit, signing up for virtually every officiating clinic in the western U.S. hosted by a big-name NBA referee and establishing himself as one of the best young officiating prospects in the Southwest. He was a kid in a hurry. \"He was confident, he was brash, he was cocky,\" Nunez Jr. says. \"Coaches didn't like him. He looked like a million dollars. He ran faster than anybody on the court, and he was very serious about what he did.\"\n\nWhen the eagerly awaited call came from the Continental Basketball Association in 1992, it wasn't without complication. The league, Kennedy says, played on Wednesdays and Saturdays in cities that were rarely nonstops from Phoenix. To make it work, Kennedy landed a day job managing a local roller rink run by a benefactor in his circle of junior college officials, Bob Seitsema, who had a certain appreciation for the demands of getting to La Crosse, Wisconsin, from Phoenix. And though Kennedy had already worked as a customer service rep for America West Airlines, a microfiche filer and a bank teller, none of them tapped his inner referee like Great Skate.\n\n\"He just had this instinct about him where he was able to go and move around the building, as the manager, and spot trouble,\" Seitsema says of Kennedy, who would scan the roller rink for the girl who takes her drink out onto the floor, the guy hitting on someone else's girlfriend, the bully trying to hustle a smaller boy by the skate counter. \"Billy would go into the DJ booth, and you had a little bit of an elevated look, and after about 10 or 15 minutes he'd say, 'See that guy over there in the red shirt? Keep an eye on him.' Sure enough, the red shirt, half an hour, 45 minutes later, the guy in the red shirt would be doing something.\"\n\nKennedy was still living with his mother in the family's two-bedroom apartment -- one he didn't move out of until he was 30 -- when she found a letter from a male friend of his that included some lurid sexual details. \"The Letter led to The Talk,\" Kennedy says, adding that he's certain his mother knew he was gay before he did. After The Talk, he began to venture into gay spaces in his early 20s -- including Charlie's, a gay country bar a few blocks from where he went to grade school.\n\n\"It had the dark windows,\" Kennedy says. \"We didn't officially know what it was, but I kind of knew what it was.\"\n\nLike many gay men, Kennedy existed somewhere between the closet and daylight during his early adult years. \"People suspected it because he's a good-looking dude, and you just didn't see him bringing girls to games,\" Nunez Jr. says. \"You didn't hear him talking about a date, Mary Jane or whoever it might be.\" Around the time he joined the CBA, Kennedy started seeing men romantically. Though he wasn't out in Ref World, there was a tacit \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy between Kennedy and his friends, who operated under the assumption that he is gay. Getting to the NBA was difficult enough without walking any further than that into the light.\n\nA 5-POUND BAG of Gold Medal flour (expires June 2006), Old El Paso hard taco shells (expires Dec. 28, 2004), multiple pouches of Kroger \"Rice & Sauce,\" date and origin unknown. This is a sample of the inventory of the pantry inside Kennedy's four-bedroom, three-bath model home in the suburban Glendale subdivision that he moved into during the 1999-2000 season. All of it is left over from the staging of the house, as are the place settings glued to place mats, framed stock photos of white families, a sign over the rec room that reads KIDS ZONE (Kennedy is childless), flower arrangements and potted plants. \"That ficus hasn't moved in 15 years,\" says NBA referee Scott Twardoski, a close friend.\n\nThe decor is such a source of amusement between Kennedy and his friends that maintaining the integrity of the model has become a badge of honor for him. Besides, an NBA referee's home is on the road. And so Kennedy, forced to disclose his sexual identity to the league office in New York to save his career, proceeded to spend the next 15 years going about the business of the bifurcated life of a gay referee.\n\n\"Being a professional official is kind of the perfect profession for avoiding,\" says Dale Scott, an MLB umpire who came out during the 2014 offseason and is one of Kennedy's close friends. \"It is very conducive to it because you are constantly on the move. It's a built-in excuse you can use, which I did.\"\n\nWith his pedigree, Kennedy was the consummate insider, as at home in a referee's locker room or at a late postgame dinner as anyone on the league roster. Yet that comfort was predicated on a certain distance from co-workers, even those he counted as personal friends. \"You say the right thing, and at the end of the day, as soon as we broke from dinner, I would go over there and they would go over there,\" Kennedy says. \"You played the game -- it's learning how to survive.\"\n\nIn Kennedy's mind, it was no real deprivation to stay in the closet on the court -- for a while, at least. He might not have declared himself openly gay, but when did referees publicly declare anything about themselves? They are the most visible, least known people in sports -- always present, never heard.\n\nThen there was Mom, who died in 2011. \"My mother didn't want me to come out,\" Kennedy says. \"That's probably 75 percent of why I didn't come out earlier. I didn't want to disappoint her or upset her. I didn't want her to get phone calls from people or feel like she had to explain. And I didn't want any harm to come to me.\"\n\nIn 2002, Kennedy met a 25-year-old man in Washington, D.C., named Craig Glover who would move to Phoenix and date Kennedy for four years. When the NBA assigned Kennedy to officiate a regular-season game in Tokyo in the fall of 2003, he brought along Glover. \"That's who he chose to bring, and even though it wasn't definitively stated, I think it's pretty neat,\" says McCutchen, who was also assigned to Tokyo and was traveling with his wife. \"It shows a real confidence in Billy internally that even though he maybe wasn't ready to be out to the world, there was enough trust to share that with his co-workers. It's no small thing.\"\n\nBack in Phoenix, Kennedy was a member of an extended circle of young, gay male professionals who socialized, played sports and traveled on weekend getaways together. Though he was on the road more than half the year, Kennedy very much resided at the center of the group. His home was frequently used as temporary housing for anyone in need. Dinner checks that never appeared at the table were often the result of Kennedy's quiet generosity. Yet as central as Kennedy's gay friends were to his life and he to theirs, he often went missing.\n\n\"Billy was the original ghoster,\" says Mike Fornelli, a close friend of Kennedy's who owns BS West, a popular gay club in Scottsdale, Arizona, that Kennedy has frequented and sung karaoke at for years. \"Any time a camera would be around, Billy's gone. If there was somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody, Billy was gone. You always expect it. If you're going out with Billy, he might disappear.\"\n\nIn a collection of photos in Kennedy's home office sits a group shot of a softball team posing for the camera after winning a tournament. A dozen men joyously pose for a gay newspaper in Houston that was covering the event, but one of the subjects is obscured. He almost seems to be intentionally ducking out of view.\n\nFriends from his officiating life unanimously say they either knew or suspected Kennedy is gay -- and didn't care. All the while, gay friends found his attempt to manage his persona entertaining, given that pegging Kennedy as gay might seem obvious to anyone with even a marginally tuned gaydar. \"Billy, you don't want people to know you're gay,\" Fornelli would quip, \"but your hands are on your hips all the fucking time.\"\n\nWhen disgraced former NBA referee Tim Donaghy effectively outed Kennedy in 2010 by telling a radio host in Boston, \"It's no secret on [the NBA officiating] staff that Bill Kennedy is a homosexual,\" Kennedy simultaneously became more relaxed about his sexual identity around people he knew yet more skittish about the possibility of it becoming public at a time when social media was exploding. \"I was really concerned with if this got legs and took off, there could be some repercussions, whether it be player-wise, whether it be coaching-wise, whether it be public-wise,\" Kennedy says. \"I had no idea, and so what I did was I just didn't do anything. I was like, 'Let's just be silent and see if this gains any traction.' And it never did.\"\n\nStill, Kennedy embraced life as an openly gay man in the digital age. Off nights in NBA cities were spent at gay karaoke or country bars, maybe a steam house or flirting on Grindr. (Kennedy's profile photo is what's known in gay parlance as a \"headless torso,\" from the waist to the neck.) He met his current on-again, off-again partner, Scott Fordham, at a karaoke bar in Toronto, where Fordham still lives. The two travel regularly on the road, where many NBA referees have spent time with the couple.\n\n\"I think he became more comfortable with it over time and he could hide in plain sight,\" Davis says. \"It just wasn't as big a deal as it used to be. Once he realized that, he became gradually aware that the world wasn't going to stop spinning and he wasn't going to lose his job if he was completely out.\"\n\nON DEC. 3, moments after the final horn in Mexico City, Kennedy wasn't half as annoyed at Rajon Rondo for calling him a \"motherfucking faggot\" in the third quarter as he was at the damn Wi-Fi in the referees' locker room at Arena Ciudad de Mexico.\n\nAn incident like the one involving Rondo and Kennedy triggers an \"atypical report\" from each of the game officials, a detailed account of what transpired from their individual perspectives, in addition to the regular game report, both of which needed to be emailed off to New York. With the Wi-Fi not cooperating at the arena, Kennedy, Bennie Adams and Ben Taylor worked on an outline of both reports that they'd finish back at the St. Regis hotel. As the crew chief, Kennedy was responsible for pulling them together, and with a flight before dawn, he needed to hustle.\n\nAs the group sat in the locker room enumerating every detail from the incident that warranted inclusion in their account, Adams noticed Kennedy's brain was churning. Though he was measured and as committed to process as ever, Kennedy was beginning to consider the enormity of what had happened on the court. After Kennedy had whistled Rondo's Kings teammate DeMarcus Cousins for a foul on Jae Crowder, Rondo had badgered Kennedy. \"That's not a fucking foul,\" he'd barked at Kennedy twice. When Rondo persisted, Kennedy assessed him a second technical and an ejection, after which Rondo stalked Kennedy, yelling after him, \"You're a motherfucking faggot. You're a faggot, Billy,\" according to the league's report.\n\n\"Billy was stunned that those were words that were used in 2015,\" Adams says. \"As the night wore on, you could see him reflecting and thinking. As he's writing the report, he's like, 'It's time that I come out and stand up.'\"\n\nThe next several hours -- at the arena, then later at the hotel -- passed in fits and starts. The referees recounted details, wrote copy, waited for Wi-Fi (the hotel rooms were experiencing intermittent outages, so the crew congregated down in the lobby), all the while listening to Kennedy weigh the potential magnitude of coming out publicly should he choose to. \"Over the course of the night between the locker room, the hotel lobby as we were writing our report, you could see the process, the conversation he was having,\" Adams says. \"'This is it for me. ... It's not OK for this to happen to people in the workplace or anywhere else. ... And I'm going to say something about it.'\"\n\nBy the time the crew finished its paperwork, it was 3 a.m. Kennedy headed to the airport as the league immediately went to work, setting up phone interviews with the officials and players involved.\n\nWhen he arrived in Miami, Kennedy received a call from Mike Bantom, the league's executive vice president of referee operations, and Kiki VanDeWeghe, executive vice president of basketball operations, both of whom had read the report and were horrified. The National Basketball Referees Association's general counsel, Lee Seham, also got in touch to discuss with Kennedy a more nuanced point: Players who have yelled anti-gay epithets at officials, as Kobe Bryant did at Adams in 2011, were typically hit with a fine ($100,000 in Bryant's case) but no suspension. Adams isn't gay, therefore the \"faggot\" hurled in his direction is regarded as offensive and inexcusable, but not hate speech. And for a league that relies on precedent when rendering verdicts, this complicated the process. Using \"faggot\" as a general schoolyard taunt against a heterosexual official isn't the same offense as attacking a gay official with \"faggot,\" but treating Rondo's behavior as hate speech would essentially out Kennedy.\n\nAsked this summer whether they were aware Kennedy is gay, a number of players and coaches characterized Kennedy's sexual identity as an open secret. But did Rondo know? A source close to the league's investigation says that Rondo was asked by Elizabeth Maringer, the NBA's vice president and assistant general counsel who led the investigation, whether he knew Kennedy was gay when the incident occurred. Rondo replied that he didn't.\n\nThe onus, then, was on Kennedy to disclose his true identity, lest the incident be treated as just another case of an NBA player hurling anti-gay language as a proxy for asshole. \"I had to take it to the next level in order for this issue to be taken up in a different court of appeal, in a different area to where people can say, 'This is not right,'\" he says. \"I knew that this was going to happen when he said it on the floor. I knew.\"\n\nHOURS AFTER THEY worked the Heat game together, Kennedy and Twardoski sat at dinner, discussing the ramifications of Kennedy's decision, then, naturally, moved on to a karaoke bar. Kennedy had mentored Twardoski, spending hours on the phone breaking down Twardoski's game film for areas of improvement. Years earlier, before Twardoski entered the NBA, he'd spent a summer at Kennedy's home in Phoenix. Every day, they'd follow a similar regimen -- the gym, lunch at Panda Express, an afternoon nap, talk shop, dinner, karaoke, then come home at 2 a.m. to break down film for four hours before going to bed at dawn.\n\nOne night in 2002, a group of referees was hanging out in a hotel suite in Mesa during a referees camp when Kennedy told Twardoski he needed to discuss something with him. Twardoski followed him out to the elevator bank, where Kennedy pointedly asked him whether there was anything specific he wanted to talk about.\n\n\"I said, 'Not really. I don't know what you're talking about,'\" Twardoski says. \"Billy goes, 'Well, right now is there anything you ever wanted to ask me? Here's the time to ask me.' I said, 'You know what, Billy, I don't have anything to ask. There's nothing I need to know unless you want to tell me something.' Billy basically said, 'I want to come out.' He was in tears, and he kept looking at me, and I said, 'And ...?' He said, 'What do you mean, \"and ... ?\"' I said, 'Billy, that doesn't change anything.'\"\n\nNow, 13 years later, Kennedy wanted to vent. The situation was frustrating, largely because it was being adjudicated outside of his control. Kennedy speculated about potential fallout and wondered whether he'd have to go in front of the media to make an announcement. He asked Twardoski whether he'd be at the news conference if that were the case. (Kennedy ultimately didn't do so.)\n\nAs the investigation moved into the next week, Kennedy grew both more frustrated and defiant. The process was taking longer than anticipated because Rondo wasn't forthcoming about what he said and, as is often the case in NBA disciplinary investigations, teammates in close proximity pleaded ignorance. In addition, the league didn't have the full broadcast complement it typically has because the game was played in Mexico City. The league hired an audiologist to confirm the officials' account of what was said.\n\nSix nights after the game, Kennedy and his friend Davis went to see A Christmas Carol: The Musical at a dinner theater in Phoenix.\n\n\"When we first sat down, he goes, 'This Mexico City thing isn't going away,'\" Davis says. \"I could tell there was some hesitancy, some insecurity just because of the volume that I knew he was going to generate in conversation, but there was also a comfort level that I had not experienced with him prior. On one hand, yeah, he might have felt like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders. But at the same time, he knew now was the time, and now was a more comfortable world to live in. I think he identified that but still felt like it was a big deal.\"\n\nScott, who officially came out in Outsports during baseball's offseason in December 2014, was an important sounding board for Kennedy, who liked that template for his own announcement. Kennedy says that, left to his own devices, he suspects he would've come out in a similar fashion in the near future. In past years, the two used to joke that they'd make a joint announcement on Ellen.\n\n\"It bothered him because it was so incredibly disrespectful and wrong,\" Scott says. \"I think that's what really spurred him to say, 'Screw this. This is not right, and I'm going to do something about it. I'm going to make a statement. I'm going to say, \"You know what? This was not only wrong in the context of official-player relationship, as far as getting ejected or getting T'd up or whatever. This was wrong on a personal level. This is wrong, and in this day and age, it's not going to be tolerated.\" ' \"\n\nFinally on Friday, Dec. 11, eight days after the Mexico City incident, the NBA issued its verdict -- Rondo would be suspended one game. \"The totality of all those issues -- trying to take into account Bill's privacy, due process for Rondo, a potential appeal and the fact that we'd never had a disciplinary issue where what was said wasn't definitively picked up by a microphone -- that's how we got to a one-game suspension in this case,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver says now.\n\nThe referees' union felt the sentence was too lenient and took issue with the notion that Silver had an imperative to protect Kennedy's privacy at the expense of a more severe sentence. \"We had every step of the way during the investigation said, 'Billy is gay. It is generally known that he is gay, and we are asking that this case not be treated in the context of the prior incidents involving the use of comparable language. It must be treated differently because he is gay,'\" Lee Seham says.\n\nKennedy received a call from Silver the weekend after the Friday verdict. Silver explained the league's rationale in issuing a one-game suspension; he knew of Kennedy's sexual identity, although the two men had never had a previous conversation about it. As such, Silver wanted to balance that knowledge with discretion.\n\nKennedy thanked Silver for his judiciousness, adding that as someone who makes judgment calls for a living, he understood how painstaking the process could be. Though he didn't mention it to Silver in that phone call, Kennedy was preparing to go public with his announcement in short order. \"I didn't think it was fair that this individual was going to say what he said and only get suspended one game,\" Kennedy says. \"I didn't think the character of him, or his character at that moment, was worth just the one-game suspension, and it had to be brought out. The only other way to bring it out was if I went public to bring attention to what actually happened. I wanted everyone to know the facts.\"\n\nKennedy coordinated a statement through Seham. Three days after the NBA's verdict, the statement was published on Yahoo Sports.\n\nKennedy was assigned to one additional Kings game after the incident, but Rondo wasn't in attendance. Three days after the incident, Rondo tweeted, \"My actions during the game were out of frustration and emotion, period! They absolutely do not reflect my feelings toward the LGBT community. I did not mean to offend or disrespect anyone.\" He has not, to this day, reached out to Kennedy directly. He declined to comment for this story.\n\nTHE NIGHT IN 2002 that Kennedy came out to Twardoski, he told Twardoski that were anything ever to happen to him -- a fatal accident or unnatural death -- he wanted Twardoski to tell everyone in attendance at the funeral the true Billy Kennedy story, one featuring a gay man who made it to the NBA as a referee. \"When the Rondo situation happened, Billy said jokingly, 'Well, you're off the hook, but I still need you to speak at my funeral,'\" Twardoski says. \"That's how important it was for him to be able to tell the story when it needed to be.\"\n\nNo more than eight hours after Kennedy began to share that story to the world, he suited up for a Spurs home game against the Jazz. The day had been a whirlwind. His statement had been released that morning, and immediately his phone had begun to convulse with calls and texts. \"I put it on silent because I couldn't keep up,\" Kennedy says. \"There were too many text messages, too many things going on, and I have to work that day.\"\n\nThe morning meeting provided a little distraction, but the story was now being broadcast nationally, and it was gaining traction. For good measure, the league dispatched a security specialist and a public relations staffer to San Antonio. Before the game, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was asked whether he was surprised by Rondo's slurs.\n\n\"Why would I be surprised?\" Popovich told the pregame media scrum. \"You see it all the time. It's unfortunate. It's disgusting. Bill is a great guy. He's been a class act on and off the court. And as far as anybody's sexual orientation, it's nobody's business. It just shows ignorance to act in a derogatory way toward anybody in the LGBT community. Just doesn't make sense.\"\n\nPopovich's comments came out of Kennedy's earshot, and Kennedy found himself in an unusual state -- terrified of taking the court. He told the public relations staffer he didn't want to take any questions from reporters. He merely wanted to work the game, then return to the hotel.\n\nWith 16 minutes remaining before player introductions, Kennedy left the officials' locker room and marched down the dank concrete corridor in the bowels of the AT&T Center. On his way to the floor, he spotted Spurs general manager R.C. Buford walking the other way.\n\n\"[R.C.] looked at me and he goes, 'You OK?'\" Kennedy says. \"I gave him a hug for like 30 seconds. I was late to the floor because of it. I almost started to cry. I was emotional, and I didn't know what the hell was going to happen. We didn't say a word to each other. Other than I looked at him and I said, 'Thank you.'\"\n\nThere's little in the universe more familiar to Kennedy than the final 15 minutes of warm-ups in an NBA arena before the horn sounds -- the thumping music, players running through their shooting and stretching rituals, the crowd growing more anticipatory. But for Kennedy that night, the scene was a blur. He faintly remembers chatting with Sean Wright, who was also working the game. Jazz forward Trevor Booker approached to say, \"Much respect to you,\" but the rest of it was all fog and nerves.\n\nAs the lights went down for player introductions, Popovich sidled up beside him -- telling Kennedy that he chose to walk over in the dark because he didn't want to make a scene that everyone could witness. \"He said, quote, unquote, 'You have more guts, you have more balls than anybody I know,'\" Kennedy says. \"'You have more courage than anybody I know. Now, go out there and kick ass.' Then he walked away. He didn't say a word to me for the rest of the game.\"\n\nON A SUNDAY in late June, Kennedy's eyes take a long tracking shot of a procession of drag queens in tiaras as they strut down Fifth Avenue in the LGBT Pride March in New York. \"I couldn't do that,\" he says to Fordham, who has joined him for the weekend's festivities. \"Oh, lord. Look at that one,\" he says about a 6-foot-4 queen with a long, flowing blue dress, a bare chest and black platform pumps.\n\nFor all the rites of passage Kennedy practiced as a semi-out gay man over the past two decades, marching in a gay pride parade had always presented a degree of difficulty too high.\n\n\"I was always concerned about who might see me, how being seen in a situation like this would affect me and affect my job,\" Kennedy says as he makes his way toward Fifth Avenue to check out the festivities. \"I was always concerned about not doing anything to jeopardize the NBA or myself or put anybody in that kind of jeopardy.\"\n\nFor gay men like Kennedy, even in 2016, the fear of consequence is real. Whatever signals one might glean from polling numbers, prestige television or a popular Facebook post circulating among his peers, Kennedy has grown up in a world where a gay man doesn't know how people are going to react when they learn he sleeps with men. Now, unless another player or official makes a similar announcement sometime soon, Kennedy will be the only openly gay man to appear on an NBA court this October when the league tips off its season.\n\nHe is a man who fears the unknown. He takes his dinner at the same casual-dining chain restaurant every single night near his home in Glendale, rotating among three dishes. He bought a model home because \"I knew what I was getting.\" Ask what frightened him the most pregame that night in San Antonio, and he tersely answers, \"the unknown.\"\n\nBut it's June 2016, and that anxiety is waning. One year ago, the U.S. Supreme Court sanctioned gay marriage nationally. Now virtually every NBA team performs at least token outreach to lesbians and gays in its market, and the league has made pro-gay messaging a point of emphasis. Pride parades used to be headlined by Dykes on Bikes. On this day, the NBA is preparing its float on 37th Street opposite a thumping T-Mobile float.\n\nThe NBA's float is the first for a pro sports league in a gay pride parade, and Silver, in accompanying it, will set another first. For Kennedy, these facts seem to hold profound meaning. He's a company man at heart, and for as long as he can remember, \"NBA official\" has been the most important identity marker in his life. The several dozen NBA employees and family members, the referees who wished him good luck before his trip to New York -- these are every bit as much his people as the boys back in Phoenix. The league is Kennedy's lifeblood, and on this day, goddamn, the league is sending Jerry West's silhouette cruising down Fifth Avenue through a canyon of dancing shirtless twinks, PFLAG moms, queer college kids and an army of nice, cosmopolitan straight New Yorkers who will cheer and wave at Kennedy as he dances atop the float.\n\n\"If you would have told me when I first started out that the NBA would have a float in the frickin' Gay Pride parade, in New York, I would have laughed at you,\" says Scott, the gay major league umpire. \"And so would Billy. He didn't see this happening 10 years ago. Let alone five years ago.\"\n\nThough multiple league sources confirm Silver was a full-throated supporter of the league being a strong presence at Pride, it didn't come without some apprehension. \"If you had asked me going in, I would've said, 'I think it's going to be 70 percent positive,'\" Silver would later say. \"We weren't looking for PR, and we didn't alert the media. But it was 100 percent positive, and that's setting aside the public relations aspect. I didn't understand how important symbolically the event was for my co-workers until that afternoon.\"\n\nNow, as the NBA float turns the corner left onto Fifth Avenue, \"Empire State of Mind\" booming from the speakers, Kennedy breaks out in dance. Then he spots Silver among the large NBA contingent that's on foot surrounding the float. Kennedy jumps off the moving float, runs to Silver and captures him with a fierce, tight hug.\n\nWhen he's done with Silver, Kennedy sprints over to the throngs of onlookers lining the sidewalks of Fifth Avenue and works the crowd like a candidate working a rope line. He slaps hands, then runs a couple of laps around the float before jumping back onto the float -- a sequence that will be repeated several times over the next two hours.\n\nA few minutes later, Kennedy is dancing with Silver, who's joined the staff on the float. Silver, wearing baggy cargo pants and an #OrlandoUnited shirt to commemorate the massacre at the Orlando gay club, pulses to the music as best he can. He waves a small rainbow flag. \"It's important that he be here,\" Kennedy says above the din. \"It makes an employee feel comfortable. It makes an employee feel that it is safe, to know that you've got our back. If we want to be who we are, you've got our back.\"\n\nLater, as the float crosses Bleecker Street, Kennedy grinds with Fordham with little inhibition. The commissioner of his league is standing 10 feet away with his own dance stylings -- one part head bob, one part shallow squat. Nobody is self-conscious, and Kennedy's appetite for the scene is insatiable. With one hand on Fordham's hips, Kennedy reaches the other into his pocket to pull out his phone. He struts up to the bow of the float, where he holds up the phone to capture the full breadth of the day.\n\nAbove the deafening music, he says, \"It feels good not to be invisible.\"",

    "raw_text": "Hockey India president Dilip Tirkey has confirmed the board's intention to expand the Hockey India League, increasing the number of teams in the Women's HIL from four to six and possibly adding more match venues next season onwards.\n\nTalking to reporters on the sidelines of the HIL in Rourkela, Tirkey said he is happy that revival of the league has been a success considering the quality of both men's and women's matches.\n\nThis year's league venues were restricted to just two cities - Ranchi and Rourkela, but that is likely to change from next season. \"There have been discussions about other venues as well. There's a possibility of having multiple venues because if it's one venue throughout, the crowd numbers go up and down. So, that's why we are also thinking that it (venues) should increase next year,\" he said.\n\nThe Women's HIL got over on January 26 with the Odisha Warriors beating JSW Soorma Hockey Club in the final. Only four teams were involved in the inaugural edition, the other two being Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers and Delhi SG Pipers.\n\n\"Yes, there are chances of increasing (women's HIL teams). We want it to go up to six,\" Tirkey said. When asked if it could include a team from Ranchi, he replied, \"There is a chance. So far, that has not happened, it can happen.\"\n\nTirkey is happy that there's constant communication between the board and the owners. The big feedback is that franchises want better marketing of the league. \"More marketing is needed because this time we got less time. How should all the players get involved, like this time some players were left out but the good thing is that the owners are showing interest in how we can make it better. So, this is a very good thing for us,\" he said.\n\nThe start date of the league (December 28) also came into question because a few foreign players couldn't make it as it was a holiday season, and they wanted to spend it with their family. When asked if Hockey India can be flexible about the dates, Tirkey said the FIH calendar makes it difficult, but they will request for a few adjustments.\n\n\"We understand that the calendar of the FIH is already packed. They created a special window and gave it to us. Still, we will request the FIH. If there's a chance for a week of 10 days adjustment. The final decision is with FIH. We'll request,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the president, the standard of both men and women matches have been world class. It's a testament to the league's quality that the two semifinal places were decided on the last day. The men's semifinal will be on January 31 with Bengal Tigers, JSW Soorma Hockey Club, Hyderabad Toofans and Tamil Nadu Dragons competing for the title.\n\n\"Till now our aim has been that there should be quality matches. We all want to make Hockey India League the best league in the world,\" he said.",

The longevity of their international careers -- Tirkey is the first Indian man to 400 caps, while Pargat is the only Indian man to have led the team at two Olympic Games -- and early elevation to leadership for both, speaks of their consistency as players.\n\nBoth were also prolific scorers, Tirkey with the more traditional hit or slap from penalty corners (PCs), while Pargat was more of a field-goal specialist. He was perhaps one of India's most attack-minded full-backs, and having him here just adds a different dimension to attack.\n\nSpeaking of which, there needs to be a drag-flick monster in the mix. We pick Jugraj Singh, one of the stars of the Junior Hockey World Cup win in Hobart in 2001, who then played the Kuala Lumpur World Cup the following year, but suffered a career-ending road accident in 2003. He was peerless with his drag-flick -- impressing Pakistan legend Sohail Abbas so much that he appointed Jugraj his spiritual successor. He has mentored some of the best Indian flickers since, and it is only fitting that their guru gets placed ahead of them in a list of this nature. Oh, and Jugraj was also an incredible first-rusher.\n\nThe midfield: Creativity across\n\nWith the midfield, there was a temptation to settle for just two, but we have gone with a trio that gives a bit of stability, and yet keeps the attacking tempo going with the team.\n\nAshok Kumar played mostly in attack, but he plays right wing here with Zafar Iqbal bombing down the left. Both legends offer free-scoring options -- Ashok got the goal that won India their only World Cup - and also speed, skill and the game sense to be able to control the tempo of the game.\n\nIn the middle of that triangle, we have Manpreet Singh. Among central midfielders, or half-backs as we usually term them, only Sardar Singh can be considered a potential replacement (Ajit Pal Singh also made this position his own, but it would be unfair to compare the pace of the game in the 1970s with modern hockey), but Manpreet just works harder than anybody. He is fast, wins most challenges in the middle, and is another excellent first rusher. In this team, he is the glue that binds the historic and the modern.'\n\nThe attack: The four forwards of the apocalypse\n\nWhat else would you term them, when opposition teams have to cope with (left to right, or right to left) Mohammad Shahid, BP Govinda, Mandeep Singh and Dhanraj Pillay?\n\nShahid was perhaps the greatest dribbler of independent Indian hockey, and that makes him an important asset to weave his way in from either wing. He and Govida often played alongside Ashok, and their interchangeability would give opposition defences nightmares. Both had incredible speed and control, which would make them handy wingers in this tactical setup.\n\nFor finishing, there are no two better players than Dhanraj and Mandeep. Yet again, a delightful convergence of the classical dribbling style of Dhanraj, and the sheer opportunism of Mandeep. With his fellow-forwards weaving through defences, Mandeep could stay low near either post, waiting to tip in anything that might fall loose.",

At last week's Indonesia Masters Super 500, no Indian progressed beyond the second round.\n\nPV Sindhu and Lakshya Sen move up BWF rankings\n\nThere were shock losses for top players such as PV Sindhu, Lakshya Sen and the pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty against unheralded opponents in what was the third straight week of play for them (except Sindhu.) There will be a brief break for the big names in the coming weeks, in which they will aim to regroup after the middling start to the year.\n\nHere's a look at this week's BWF rankings of the top Indian players, and what that tells us about the state of play:\n\n(Note: BWF rankings update every Tuesday and for this purpose, we will look at the Top 32 as that is the tournament's draw size.)\n\nMen's Singles Rankings\n\nLakshya Sen, 10 (--)\n\nHS Prannoy, 31 (--)\n\nThere has been no major change in India's men's singles ranking in the top 32.\n\nHowever, Kiran George's rise last week due to his India Open run has reversed, as he falls two spots to world No 37. Another cause for concern is former world No 1 Kidambi Srikanth, who lost to fellow Indian Ayush Shetty (up 1 spot to 46) in qualifying last week and is currently down two spots to world No 47.\n\nThe world No 1 remains China's Shi Yu Qi.\n\nWomen's Singles Rankings\n\nPV Sindhu, 13 (-1)\n\nMalvika Bansod, 29 (-2)\n\nNot a good week for Indian women's badminton as both Sindhu and Malvika Bansod slipped down the rankings.\n\nSindhu was stunned in the first round in Indonesia by world No. 32 Nguyen Thuy Linh of Vietnam 22-20, 21-12. It was not a result many saw coming as the Indian had started her season looking physically sharp at the Indian Open the week before. Malvika, on the other hand, did not play the tournament.\n\nSouth Korea's An Se Young maintains her dominance at the top of the charts.\n\nMen's Doubles Rankings\n\nSatwik-Chirag, 7 (+2)\n\nSome good news in doubles as Satwik and Chirag have climbed two placed to No 7. However, this is not due to their performance over the last week - an erratic, second-round loss to Kittinupong Kedren - Dechapol Puavaranukroh of Thailand 20-22, 21-23.\n\nIt's partly due to the dropping off former world champion pair of Seo Seungjae and Kang Minhyuk, both of whom have different partners now.\n\nThe world No 1 pair remain Denmark's Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen.\n\nWomen's Doubles Rankings\n\nTreesa-Gayatri, 9 (--)\n\nAshwini-Tanisha, 19 (--)\n\nWhile Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand did not play last week (Indonesia Masters is a Super 500 and there not mandatory), Ashwini Ponappa and Tanisha Crasto lost in the second round in a three-game battle.\n\nThe top pair continue to be South Korea's Baek Hana and Lee Sohee.\n\nMixed Doubles Rankings\n\nSikki-Sumeeth, 31 (--)\n\nAadya-Sathish, 32 (--)\n\nBoth pairs were not in action in the last week.\n\nThe world No 1 pair remains China's Feng Yan Zhe and Huang Dong Ping, and by a sizeable margin.",

    "raw_text": "A dramatic night at the 2024 Paris Paralympics saw Navdeep Singh win the gold medal in the men's javelin throw F41 - for athletes of a short stature. On the field, Navdeep finished in second place with a best throw of 47.32m, then breaking the Paralympic record, but was bettered by Iranian para-athlete Sajdegh Sayah Beit's throw of 47.64m later.\n\nHowever, Sayah was later disqualified for 'unsporting or improper conduct', with Iran appealing the decision, only for that appeal to be rejected - thus awarding Navdeep the gold medal.\n\nPARALYMPICS 2024 KEY DATES | EVERY MEDAL WON BY INDIA AT THE PARALYMPICS | PARALYMPIC CLASSIFICATIONS EXPLAINED\n\nPost his 'victory' Sayah unfurled a flag that he later claimed was that of Umm al-Banin, wife of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the first Shia Imam. Having already earned a yellow card during the competition for a technical offence, he was then disqualified for this second offence, under rule 8.1 of the International Paralympics Committee (IPC) regulations, which states:\n\n\"The IPC Code of Ethics and the World Para Athletics Code of Conduct (both located on the IPC website) shall apply to all participants of World Para Athletics Recognised Competitions. Any breach of these Regulations shall be determined in accordance with the procedures outlined in the World Para Athletics Code of Conduct.\"\n\nThe specific rule in question appears to be a violation of the rule 1.11 of the IPC Code of Ethics, which states:\n\n\"Refrain from using the Paralympic Games and the Paralympic Movement to promote any political agenda, other than the advancement of sport for persons with an impairment and democracy, empowerment, equality, and the protection of human rights.\"\n\nIran's appeal of the disqualification meant that the medal ceremony of the men's javelin F41 event was postponed.\n\nSayah's appeal centred around his claim that the flag was a religious symbol, and not a political one. However, the current interpretation of IPC rules allows for no other flag than that of the para-athlete's country to be displayed. Sayah also claimed that he had unfurled the flag of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the Tokyo Paralympics, where he won a silver medal, but was not reprimanded. This claim could not be verified. It is also possible that Sayah only earned a single yellow card in Tokyo and thus escaped disqualification.\n\nUltimately, Iran's appeal was rejected by the IPC, and the medal ceremony of the men's javelin throw F41 event was eventually conducted, with Navdeep awarded the gold medal - one of only 13 Indians to have ever won gold at the Paralympics.",

He finished fourth in the final with a best throw of 40.80m, behind the bronze medeallist from Iraq Wildan Nukhailawi who threw 41.39m. It was heart-breaking, missing a medal by a few centimetres.\n\nThree years later, there were no such heartbreaks at the Paris Paralympics. In fact, it was the opposite. Navdeep finished with the second-best throw of 47.32m but his silver medal was upgraded to gold in a dramatic turn of events.\n\nIran's Sajdegh Sayah Beit had initially won the gold with a best throw 47.64m but he was disqualified for 'unsporting/improper conduct' - after displaying a non-state flag - in breach of Paralympic rules.\n\nPARALYMPICS 2024 KEY DATES | EVERY MEDAL WON BY INDIA AT THE PARALYMPICS | PARALYMPIC CLASSIFICATIONS EXPLAINED\n\nSun Pengxiang , the defending champion from China, ended up getting upgraded from bronze to silver and Nukhailawi was declared as the bronze winner.\n\nIt's incredible to think that the 23-year-old Navdeep was not initially interested in javelin throw. Like his father Dalbir Singh, he also wanted to become a wrestler and even competed in some events. In 2017, he took up para javelin after watching another para-athlete Sandeep Chaudhary in action.\n\nIt was always going to be difficult for Navdeep, who is around 4 feet 4 inches, to hurl a javelin which is around 7 feet. But once he started tasting success at the highest level, there was no looking back.\n\n\"The spear was big when I first saw javelin throwers practising during competitions. I met Sandeep bhaiya in one such event for the first time and we became friends later. When I decided to pursue the sport, he trained me and helped me in ironing out all the flaws,\" Navdeep told the New Indian Express.\n\nBefore starting out in the final in Paris, Navdeep knew he would face a tough competition considering all the medallists from Tokyo were there in the field. But that would not deter him. With his second throw, which was a personal best of 46.39m, he laid out his intentions clear. There was no way he would go back from Paris without a medal. He improved on his personal best and set a Paralympic record with his next throw, which fetched him a medal. And soon that made him a Paralympic champion.\n\nThis was India's 29th medal at Paris Paralympics 2024, comfortably beating the Pre-Games expectations.",

    "raw_text": "What's the story?\n\nThe 12 Pro Kabaddi League teams have announced the list of players they have retained and released ahead of the PKL's 11th season. The franchises can retain players across three categories: Elite Retained Players, Retained Young Players and Existing New Young Players.\n\nBetween the 12 teams, 88 players have been retained among the three categories.\n\nWho are the big released names?\n\nSome of the biggest names in the PKL universe - Pawan Sehrawat, Mohammadreza Shadloui, Pardeep Narwal and Maninder Singh - have all been released by their respective franchises.\n\nAll of them were released ahead of the last season as well, so it does not come as a big surprise. Teams can still acquire the services of these players by using the Final Bid Match [FBM] card during the auction.\n\nWhat did these big names do last season?\n\n\u2022 Pawan Sehrawat: Became PKL's most-expensive player of all-time and led a young, unheralded Telugu Titans squad. He did well to finish as the third-best raider, but his team won all of two matches and finished at the bottom.\n\n\u2022 Mohammadreza Shadloui: Won the title with Puneri Paltan. Was the season's best defender and had the most tackle points and High 5s\n\n\u2022 Pardeep Narwal: Had a poor season with UP Yoddhas, who only won four games in 22. He managed just 122 points in 17 games and finished 15th among the raiders, a terrible low considering his loft standards.\n\n\u2022 Maninder Singh: PKL's Mr Consistent had a good season personally and was the fourth-best raider, but his team, the Bengal Warriors, missed the playoffs.\n\nWho are the big retained names?\n\nPuneri Paltan have retained their star raiding trio of Aslam Inamdar, Mohit Goyat and Pankaj Mohite as they look to become only the second team to retain their title.\n\nOne of their main challengers will be Dabang Delhi, who have held on to their captain Naveen Kumar [who was injured for large parts last season] and stand-in skipper Ashu Malik.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers, the two-time champs, have retained their MVP Arjun Deshwal.\n\nWhen is the auction?\n\nThe PKL Season 11 player auction will be held in Mumbai on August 15 and 16.\n\nHow does the auction work?\n\nThe domestic and foreign players will be divided into four categories: A, B, C and D. The players will be further subdivided as 'All-Rounders', 'Defenders' and 'Raiders' within each category. The base prices for each of the categories are Category A - \u20b930 Lakh, Category B - \u20b920 Lakh, Category C - \u20b913 Lakh and Category D - \u20b99 Lakh.\n\nOver 500 players will be part of the auction pool, including the 24 players from the two finalist teams of the Khelo India University Games 2024.\n\nEach team will have a total salary purse of \u20b95 crore.",

    "raw_text": "The badminton season is coming to an end for this year, but for Indian badminton fans there's a new beginning to look forward to - the post-Olympics return of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty. The men's doubles pair will be back in action at the China Masters Super 750 starting Tuesday, along with almost all of India's top players.\n\nThe storylines at the final major BWF tournament of 2024 are intriguing, especially from an Indian perspective as players look to end a challenging season on a high. There's the return of Sat-Chi without a regular coach, a rematch of the Olympic bronze medal match for Lakshya Sen and PV Sindhu's continued fight to regain her old aura.\n\nThe biggest talking point, of course, is Satwik-Chirag making their comeback.\n\nThe former world No 1 pair haven't played since their quarterfinal exit at the Paris Olympics in August, taking some time off for Satwik to recover from the shoulder injury that has plagued him for most of this season. They have started training together for the last few weeks and reached China well in advance as they gear up for a fresh Olympic cycle after the heartbreak of the last one.\n\nThey had reached the final of the event last year, losing to China's world No 1 pair Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang. This year, they may not be able to replicate the run given they will have more rust compared to the field, but will look to build some momentum in what has been a season of two contrasting halves. They started 2024 with a bang, reaching three straight finals and being gold medal favourites in Paris; but an injury setback coupled with losses in important matches as the field figured out an antidote to their attack have seen them struggle.\n\nThe absence of coach Mathias Boe, who announced his retirement in August, will also be a challenge to deal with as he was instrumental in their rapid growth. There is no confirmation about their new coach, although rumours of Tan Kim Her - the man responsible for putting the champion pair together - returning have been doing the rounds. For now, it is expected that chief India coach Pullela Gopichand will be in their corner along with someone from the national set up.\n\nSat-Chi seeded sixth now after a long time away from the circuit, and placed in the same section as second seeds and fierce rivals Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen. They will start their campaign Chinese Taipei's Yang Po-Hsuan and Lee Jhe-Huei, whom they have a 3-0 record against, on Wednesday. The real test will be coming out of the quarter to match last year's run while shaking off the rust and adjusting to a post-Boe world.\n\nElsewhere in singles, the big match to watch out for will be Lakshya Sen's opener against reigning Olympic bronze medallist Lee Zii Jia.\n\nLakshya leads the Malaysian 4-2 in the head-to-head but the last time they played was the Paris Olympics where the Indian's loss from a winning position resulted in scar tissue that he's yet to overcome. Indeed, the 23-year-old is yet to win a match since the Olympics... with all being losses from a game up. As discussed on these pages last week, there's no question about Lakshya's physical ability to win big, but it's the mentality that needs to click in tough situations.\n\nIf he can put behind last week's loss in Japan and get a win over Lee it'll do his confidence a world of good irrespective of where he finishes in the tournament. If he can get that win, he will play the winner of Rasmus Gemke vs Kenta Nishimoto and Anders Antonsen is the other seed in his quarter. Can Lakshya end his losing streak? Only time will tell.\n\nAlso in men's singles, Priyanshu Rajawat has been promoted from reserves and will start against Chico Aura Dwi Wardoyo (H2H 0-2 ) and if we wins, have a potential second-round against world No 1 Shu Yu Qi.\n\nIn women's singles, all Indian eyes will be on PV Sindhu as she strives to make a deep run at a big event, but there's another positive storyline - the presence of four Indians in the draw. World No 35 Malvika Bansod, who has had memorable last few months, World No 44 Aakarshi Kashyap and World No 48 Anupama Upadhya (Promoted from reserves) are also in the draw.\n\nSindhu, who lost a 75-minute battle to old foe Michelle Li last week, has been struggling to close out matches off late. The now world No 20 is no longer seeded after a trophy-less run in the last two years and will take on Thai Busanan Ongbamrungphan, who she had beaten just last week and lead 19-1. A win will pit her against either Yeo Jia Min and Lo Sin Yan Happy, and both should be matches the Indian can win. The big test will be the quarterfinals should she reach there, likely against eighth seed Supanida Katethong, whom she leads 5-4 on head-to-head record, in her opener. This one will be tricky as Sindhu has been troubled by the left-hander before, but reaching the quarters will be a good boost nonetheless.\n\nMalvika will take on Line H\u00f8jmark Kjaersfeldt, Aakarsi will face Tomoka Miyazaki of Japan in her opener, in the first round while Anupama will play Beiwan Zhang. There may not be many expectations from the second tier of Indian women's badminton, but competing in big tournaments will give much needed experience.\n\nIn women's doubles, Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand, who made a first round exit from the Kumamoto Masters Japan, last week will start against Hu Ling Fang and Jheng Yu Chieh and a win will pit them against Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning.\n\nIn mixed doubles, B Sumeeth Reddy and Sikki Reddy will take on Presley Smith and Jennie Gai and a win will result in a clash with Chinese top seeds Feng Yan Zhe and Huang Dong Ping.",

    "raw_text": "Graham Reid is back in the land that loves him like no other -- India -- doing the thing he loves more than anything else -- coaching a hockey team. Reid had made India fall back in love with its OG sport, having them play an all-out attacking, entertaining style of hockey, and coaching them to an Olympic medal (the first in 41 years). It ended, with an early exit in the home World Cup in 2023 but he's back, as head coach of Delhi SG Pipers in the Hockey India League. And though there are no medals in sight - the team are last among the eight teams after nine matches - they bear the Reid stamp of attractive, free-flowing hockey.\n\nHow's he feeling about all this, then? \"Fine. Well, you know...bottom of the ladder,\" Reid tells ESPN, with a chuckle\n\nBut he's not too disappointed. Sure, the results have not been there, but success for Reid is measured differently: making the team play in his philosophy -- aggressive hockey with emphasis on scoring. Delhi have been eye-catching, scoring plenty of goals but also conceding far too many. They scored 17 goals, fifth most in the league but also conceded 35, the most so far. They have created 55 penalty corner chances which is the second most in the league.\n\nEven when results are taken into context, from the nine matches so far, four went to shootouts, out of which they lost three. They've lost two games by a one-goal margin. In the more recent match against Vedanta Kalinga Lancers, they were leading 4-1 and 5-2 before conceding in a 5-5 draw and losing in the shootout.\n\n\"I get angry when the effort is not there. When there's effort, people are listening and trying to execute then you know...it is what it is,\" Reid says. \"I've tried to keep things positive. That's the difficult part for the coach. At some point, what do you say? For example, my whatever number of years I've been coaching, I take goal opportunity total. That is the number of scoring opportunities. We've created more opportunities in most of the games. Six out of the eight, we've created more opportunities than the opposition. If that's happening, it can't all be bad,\" Reid says.\n\nAnd he's right. It really isn't all that bad -- his team has been a fun watch, much like that well-loved Indian team of the past. There's also another big factor to take into consideration: DSGP were the most affected team in terms of withdrawals by foreign players. They had to replace as many as six foreigners before the start of the tournament. Reid agrees that so many withdrawals affected the balance but it's a testament to his coaching that he still was able to deliver a good team with the replacements, a team that was successful in playing his brand of hockey.\n\nThere's a nice mixture of sorts to his style, which makes the sport more exciting. And Reid thanks India for that. \"I used to think that Australia and Holland and somewhere in the middle there's a really good brand of hockey, but my new philosophy is somewhere in the middle of the three, the triangle between India, Netherlands and Australia. You got the Australian discipline, you got the Dutch flair and then you got the Indian skills and abilities,\" he says.\n\nThat mixture may not work all the time, but it makes for proper entertainment. The Indian players in the past and his current Delhi team have shown when it works on the field, there's nothing like it. There's a freedom to his hockey, the free-flowing nature also helps in improving self-belief amongst his players, which is hugely beneficial to the youngsters. Just look at what happened with the likes of Hardik Singh, Harmanpreet Singh, Vivek Sagar Prasad and Shamsher Singh when he was the coach of India. Now, tantalizingly, it could happen with the likes of Aaditya Lalage, Sourabh Kushwa, Dilraj Singhm and Rohit from DSGP.\n\nReid believes Indian youngsters are on the right track, especially with the revival of Hockey India League. Opportunities like the HIL will push Indian hockey forward but there's also a piece of advice for those who are tying to make their mark. \"Someone like Sanjay is a really good example. He's now an Olympian and a bronze medal winner. When he played in the Junior World Cup under me, he was very loose with his marking, bit casual, not much effort. And what you see now is a really polished performer -- he marks tighter and a became a good player. The little things like understanding when the opposition have the ball, you need to be switched on. That's what I see in younger players that they switch off not recognising the danger. And just a little bit of calmness about the play. That's what you learn from Europeans and other country players,\" he says.\n\nDSGP's last match of the league is against Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers on January 27. It didn't go as per the plan for Reid this time, but as ever he'll be hoping to bounce back next season and hoping that his team's efforts on the field finally reflect in terms of positive results. DSGP, and India, will be waiting.",

    "raw_text": "PV Sindhu and Lakshya Sen are set to return to competitive badminton action after a break of two months post their respective Olympics heartbreaks, with the Arctic Open Super 500 in Finland starting Tuesday.\n\nSindhu and Lakshya will lead an Indian contingent which also includes Kidambi Srikanth playing qualifiers as well as a bunch of young singles players who have been making the main draw of BWF World Tour events lately.\n\nThe duo had taken a long break after their campaign at the Paris Games ended in early August without a medal, and since then have sought to regroup and recalibrate.\n\nSindhu has put together a whole new coaching set up, appointing Anup Sridhar as her interim coach until the end of the season, and also added South Korean legend Lee Syun Il as a consultant coach in the last month, as she looks to make a push at the end of her season. Her previous coach, Indonesia's Agus Dwi Santoso, joined the team only earlier this year but his contract ended after the Olympics where she lost in the Round of 16. Sridhar was Lakshya's coach till late last year, before they parted ways amid his long slump.\n\nLakshya, meanwhile, has worked on his physicality in the time off since losing his bronze medal match in Paris against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia. He has undergone a series of tests at the Red Bull Athlete Performance Centre in Salzburg, Austria in a bid to understand his body and fitness better.\n\nTheir current form as well as the effects of the Olympics preparation and heartbreak are yet to be seen. The Arctic Open does not have a loaded field with several big names missing, but the Indians' level on comeback will be something to watch out for in the coming week.\n\nMeanwhile, HS Prannoy and the men's doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty are the notable names missing from the draw. The former has opted for a protected ranking as he recovers from the aftereffects of chikungunya, which effectively means he has ended his season. The status of Satwik-Chirag's fitness, coaching after Mathias Boe's resignation, and return to the tour are not yet known.\n\nHere's a closer look at the draws and chances of the Indian contingent:\n\nWomen's singles\n\nHow Sindhu proceeds after an Olympic campaign that was the end of an era is an important storyline for Indian badminton. The 29-year-old returned without an Olympic medal for the first time and this would have led to introspection and new goal-setting. The appointment of a new foreign coach is a good sign, suggesting that Sindhu is looking to revamp aspects of her game and perhaps focus more on the BWF Tour where she has not always won big titles.\n\nSeeded sixth, Sindhu starts against familiar rival Michelle Li, whom she leads 10-3. A win would present an interesting challenge against 18-year-old Japanese rising star Tomako Miyazaki. The teen has won their only meeting, at the Swiss Open earlier this year, and represents the new generation of players Sindhu has to contend with. The other seed in her quarter is Paris bronze medallist Gregoria Mariska Tunjung, who has been struggling physically and was beaten by Malvika Bansod at the China Open last month.\n\nBansod, who has risen to world No 37 after her superb week in China, will also be one to watch out for. Playing for the first time since that quarterfinal run, she starts against world No. 24 Sung Shuo Yun of Chinese Taipei in what will be their first meeting. A win will see her play against either top seed Wang Zhi Yi or former world champion Ratchanok Intanon.\n\nAlso in the main draw is Aakarshi Kashyap who plays Yvonne Li of Germany, against whom she trails 3-1. A win will mean a clash with second seed Han Yue.\n\nIn the qualifiers, 17-year-old Unnati Hooda will look to make the main draw by beating Heli Neiman of Israel.\n\nMen's Singles\n\nAll eyes will be on Lakshya, who had made quite the impression at the Paris Olympics where he finished fourth. The unseeded Indian will start his campaign against Denmark's Rasmus Gemke against whom he has a 1-1 record. A win would mean a rematch of the Olympic quarterfinals against seventh seed Chou Tien Chen - where Lakshya had played one of his best match to beat the veteran. He's in the same quarter as top seed Anders Antonsen, who leads Lakshya 4-2.\n\nIf Lakshya plays like he did in Paris, he has the ability to beat any player and restart his season on a strong note. But the key will be his mentality in pressure situations, which is what led to his narrow medal miss in the first place. To test that aspect, he will have to put himself in finals and big matches often and that should be his aim in this final part of the 2024 season.\n\nThere will be more Indians in the draw with three players in the fray in for four spots in qualification. Srikanth, who returned from a four-month injury layoff, is set to face compatriot and top seed Kiran George and the winner will make the main draw. Sathish Karunakaran will take on France's Arnaud Merkle.\n\nThe doubles draw for India is bare this tournament. There is no Indian representation in men's doubles, which is a loaded field with almost all top pairs action.\n\nRituparna Panda and Swetaparna Panda will compete in women's doubles, and Sathish will partner with Aadya Variyath in mixed doubles.",

    "raw_text": "If you write, people want to visit your office. It doesn't matter if you're immortal or middling; the immortal may get lines of tourists, and the middling curious friends and straggling fumigators, but the impulse is the same -- people want to see where the mystery happens, if only to make the mystery less mysterious. They want to see the talismans rubbed smooth and the voodoo dolls stuck with pins; they want to admire the view that somehow produces the point of view; most of all, they want not only to spy where the magician stashes his hat, but also to make sure he feeds the rabbits. The work may revel in disarray; but the office should be nothing less than a vision of order, evidence that a story well-written should lead to a life well-lived.\n\nIn this, my office is no different from the haunt of any other scribbler: It attracts visitors. Its only distinction is that also repels them. Time and again, I've lead the hopeful up the stairs to the little bedroom that serves as my \"atelier,\" only to see the reality snuff the hope -- and the fantasy that my office might be charming enough to warrant description en fran\u00e7ais -- from their eyes. It is a sobering experience, for them and for me; for I have seen kindly family members literally recoil from the sight of my workshop, and well-meaning acquaintances let out an involuntary \"Oh\" under their breath, before turning on their heels and getting the hell out, as if they have seen something they weren't meant to see. I have had many people come to visit; I have never had anyone stay very long, including my wife, my daughter and my dog.\n\nI do not know why this is, exactly. My office is on the second floor of my house, with a pleasing view of a wooded backyard; it's loaded with knick-knacks and personal mementoes; it is bursting -- barnacled -- with books. Though small and cramped, it is, in short, as well-appointed as many another writer's domicile, and I am nothing if not friendly. Come and visit, and I will not only show you around; I will make sure the unsteady stack of literary magazines tottering in the corner doesn't fall on you. Come and visit, and I will explain why taped to my window frame is not only a succession of wallet photos of my daughter Nia, but also postcards of Hans Hoblein's portraits of Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell, angrily squaring off. Come and visit, and I will show you not only the first book I ever bought -- \"The Portable Faulkner,\" kept within easy reach -- but also, like, the four-thousandth.\n\nAnd yet nobody visits; or, put another way, everybody by now knows better than to come up the stairs. Hell, I know better. When I come home from traveling, my office is often the first place I stop and visit; it also the first place I flee, even when I have to write. This is not a bad thing; more and more, I have stripped myself of rituals, and have made offices of wherever I happen to sit myself down. I write on the couch; I write in bed; I write, like everybody else, at Starbucks; I write, as I am writing now, in a cubicle at the local public library. My office is often where I start; some impersonal place, barren of everything but necessity, is generally where I, and whatever it is I am writing, end up.\n\nMy wife would offer a simple explanation for the failure of my office to be an office: it's a mess. I disagree. Not that it's messy, or that the accumulated water glasses and coffee cups tend to overwhelm the meaning of the carefully curated personal arcana; it is, and they do. But even on those occasions when I've tidied up, there is something about my office that keeps visitors at bay, something that goes to the heart of the whole idea that the best place to find a writer is where he or she happens to work. A scribbler's haunt is always haunted by the unscribbled, and so it is with mine. It hardly matters that I keep, within arm's length of the plastic core-building accordion that now serves as my chair, a chronological collection of every magazine in which I've published a story. It matters even less that, since I've been at this a while, the collection can be measured by the yard, for on the shelves above are the yards of uniform slipcased masterpieces published by the Library of America, to which I've dutifully and nerdily subscribed for 35 years. The discrepancy is intentional; so is the comment cast upon my output by the complete works of H.L Mencken and Mark Twain. My office, then, is where my motivation melds with my masochism, and where as a result I can neither stay nor stay away from very long.",

As most India games have been throughout this tournament, this was once again decided be Deepika, who scored her 11th goal in seven games.\n\nAs has been the case in the last three matches, India once again failed to score in the first half, despite being the better side. They had chances from penalty corners, The goal came after a messy piece of play, as Sushila Chanu initially failed to halt a penalty corner injection properly. But India kept the play alive and found Deepika in the circle on the left hand side. She waited, took her time, and then unleashed a fierce tomahawk that went low to the far corner and beat the Chinese goalkeeper.\n\nSoon after, India had the opportunity to double the lead as a penalty stroke was awarded for a push on Deepika inside the circle. She stepped up from the spot and sent a low shot to the goalkeeper's right, but Li Ting, at full stretch, got her gloves to it and kept the ball out.\n\nIndia had another penalty corner opportunity post that, but again didn't take the opportunity because of a mistrap from Sushila. However, their struggles from penalty corners were in complete contrast to how comfortable they were at the back. India didn't concede a single penalty corner in the second half, and the only real opening that China had throughout the game was met with a superb save from Bichu Devi, who, as throughout the tournament, had split goalkeeping duties with Savita Punia.\n\nThis was India's third Asian Champions Trophy, and their second in a row, after successfully defending the title that they had won in Ranchi last year. This Harendra Singh era now has a real base to build on, but India are nowhere near the finished article, which is what the coach aims to make them as they build towards the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nYou can relive the match on our live blog, below:",

    "raw_text": "Editor's note: This story on Tiger Woods was originally published on April 21, 2016. Watch some of the Masters' most memorable moments Friday on ESPN.\n\nAct I\n\nTen years ago, Tiger Woods sat in his boyhood home across from his father's body, waiting on the men from the funeral home to arrive and carry Earl away. It was around 3 in the morning. Outside this bedroom in Cypress, California, the mechanism of burial and goodbye sputtered into action, while inside, Tiger and his half sister, Royce, floated in those gauzy first hours after a death, when a loved one isn't there but doesn't quite seem gone either. About an hour earlier, Earl had taken two or three final breaths that sounded different from the ones that came before. Tiger got the call and came straight to Cypress, passing the Navy golf course where he learned to play, turning finally onto Teakwood Street. His dad never sold the house because he liked the easily accessible nostalgia. If Earl wanted, he could go see the Obi-Wan Kenobi poster still hanging on Tiger's closet door, or find an old Nintendo or Lego Star Destroyer. Earl died three steps from his son's old room.\n\nRoyce says she sat with her father on the bed, rubbing his back, like she'd done the last few hours as he faded.\n\n\"You're waiting for him to wake up?\" Tiger asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Royce said.\n\n\"I am too.\"\n\nThree days later, on May 6, 2006, the family gathered at a private air terminal in Anaheim to take Earl's remains back to Manhattan, Kansas, where he grew up. Tiger's mom, Tida, and his wife, Elin, sat together in the Gulfstream IV, facing each other, according to Royce. Elin did college homework, which she often did during any free moment, in airplanes or even on fishing trips, working toward her degree in psychology. Tiger's half siblings came along; Royce and Earl Jr. sat at a table, and Kevin sat across from them on a couch. There were six passengers total, and Tiger plopped down in his usual seat, in the front left of the plane. He put the urn holding his father's remains directly across from him -- Royce made a joke about \"strapping Dad in\" -- and when the pilot pushed the throttles forward to lift off, Royce said, Tiger stretched out his legs to hold the urn in place with his feet.\n\nThe flight took 2 hours and 20 minutes. His siblings tried to talk about the old days. Kevin retold a favorite about a camping trip with a 10- or 11-year-old Tiger, in a forest of tall trees: While walking to use the bathroom, Tiger had stopped and peered high into the branches.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Kevin had asked him.\n\n\"Ewoks,\" Tiger said.\n\nSitting in the plane, Tiger didn't say much. He and his siblings landed and drove to the Sunset Cemetery, a mile southwest of K-State's campus, past the zoo and a high school and a cannon dedicated to the memory of dead Union soldiers. Earl, a former Green Beret and Vietnam combat veteran, would have liked that. The graveyard was cool in the shade, the hills rolling from the street toward a gully. Woodpeckers hammered away in the trees. The family gathered around a hole in the ground, between Earl's parents, Miles and Maude Woods. Two cedars and five pines rose into the air. Tiger stayed strong, comforting his mother, and Earl Jr. watched him, impressed. They buried the ashes and left.\n\nAfter a brief stop at the house where Earl grew up -- strangers owned it, so the Woods family stood in the front yard and told a few stories, and this being rural Kansas, the neighbors didn't interrupt or ask for autographs -- everyone headed back to the airport. Seventy-seven minutes after touching down in Kansas, Tiger took off again for Orange County.\n\nConsider him in that moment, 30 years old, the greatest golfer in the world, winner of 10 major championships and counting, confident that the dreams he and his father conceived on Teakwood Street would eventually all come true. His pilot climbed above the clouds. The return trip took 40 minutes longer, exactly 3 hours, and nobody said much, feeling heavy, processing the idea that they'd left Earl behind in the Kansas dirt. Tiger Woods sat in his usual place, facing forward, the seat across from him empty now.\n\nALMOST 10 YEARS later, on the far western end of an island in the Bahamas, Tiger Woods is where he feels most comfortable: hidden behind multiple layers of security and exclusivity, standing with two or three friends in the dark of a marina. It's early December, 28 days before his 40th birthday. His annual tournament begins at a nearby course soon. Both his boats float a few dozen yards away, in two of the first three slips: the 155-foot yacht named Privacy, alongside the smaller, sleeker diving boat he named Solitude. On the main deck of the big boat, there's a basket of sunscreen, a pile of rolled towels and a white orchid. The marina around them couldn't be more private, without a coffee shop or store, not even showing up on the navigational charts in some maritime GPS systems. (Woods' camp declined to comment for this story.)\n\nBehind the story\n\nDeputy editor Ty Wenger and senior editor Paul Kix talk with senior writer Wright Thompson about his comprehensive story on Tiger Woods' secret life after his father's passing. Listen here \u00bb\n\nDocking in a luxury marina is about the only place to catch a random glimpse of Tiger, who moves through the world in a cocoon of his own creation. When he bought his plane, he blocked the tail number from tracking websites: It ends in QS, the standard code for NetJets. Many athletes, by contrast, have some sort of vanity registration, and some even have custom paint jobs; Michael Jordan's plane is detailed in North Carolina blue, and his tail number is N236MJ -- the \"6\" is for his titles. Jack Nicklaus flies around in N1JN nicknamed Air Bear. Sitting on a tarmac, Tiger's plane looks like it belongs to an anonymous business traveler, nothing giving away its famous owner. He comes and goes quietly.\n\nTonight the running lights glowing just offshore belong to Steven Spielberg's The Seven Seas. Marina staff members come across a lot of celebrities, and when they gather away from work, they tell stories, about how Johnny Depp is down-to-earth or how Tiger isn't a diva but is just, well, he's just really weird. Once, when his dog left a tennis ball in the harbormaster's office, Tiger called down and asked someone to \"secure\" the ball until a crew member could retrieve it, and the staff still laugh and roll their eyes about it. They don't know that he often uses military lingo, a small window into how deep he's gotten into that world, words like \"secure\" and \"downrange\" and, even in text messages to his friend Michael Jordan, \"roger that.\"\n\nStanding at the southwest corner of the marina, Tiger and his group make plans for later, and then he walks off down the road. There's no entourage or Team Tiger, no agent or handlers or managers, just a middle-aged man alone, coming to terms with himself and his future, which will hold far more quiet marinas in the years ahead than packed fairways. Not long ago, he asked Jordan a simple yet heavy question: How did you know when it was time to walk away?\n\nTiger hasn't hit a golf ball in about two months. He can't really run; not long ago, he told Time magazine, he fell down in his backyard without a cellphone and had to just lie there until his daughter happened to find him. Tiger sent her to get help. He's had two back operations in the past three months. Yesterday at a news conference, he said for the first time in public that his golf career might be over.\n\nA reporter asked what he did for exercise.\n\n\"I walk,\" he said.\n\nAnd?\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"I walk and I walk some more.\"\n\nHe paused, and asked himself a question. \"Where is the light at the end of the tunnel?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I think pretty much everything beyond this will be gravy.\"\n\nHis friends started hearing these admissions about a month ago. His college roommate Notah Begay texted him around Halloween. Tiger loves Halloween. He's a big kid in many ways. When he lived in Orlando, a former neighbor said, he liked to ride on a skateboard behind a golf cart in the gated country club he called home. He loves the Transformers and comic-book heroes; in the past, he's checked into hotels under the name Logan Howlett, which is Wolverine's human name in X-Men. When he booked his free-diving lessons in Grand Cayman, instructor Kirk Krack recalled, he reserved his spot under the name Eric Cartman. So of course he loves Halloween, and when Notah asked about his costume, Tiger wrote back.\n\n\"I'm going as a golfer known as Tiger Woods.\"\n\nSitting at a steakhouse in the Bahamas one night, Begay is quiet for a moment. He's here for the Golf Channel, forced years ago by his own bad back to make the same admissions that Tiger is making now: The dreams he dreamed as a boy are ending. They met as children -- Tiger was 9 and Notah was 12 -- playing youth golf in California. They saw each other, perhaps the only nonwhite, nonwealthy people around, and Notah walked up to Tiger and told him, \"You'll never be alone again.\" They've been friends ever since, passing together through each stage of life. A few weeks ago, he and Tiger were hanging out at the house in Jupiter when Woods realized they needed to make a carpool run and get his kids at school. They drove over and parked in line with the other parents, about 30 minutes early, and to kill the time, they laughed and talked about Stanford. \"Tiger and I do a lot of looking back,\" Begay says. \"He loves to talk about college.\"\n\nTiger told stories about how his daughter likes soccer and is already a prankster, and Begay said how his girl loves gymnastics and drawing, and then they both looked at each other and just started laughing: Can you believe we are sitting in a carpool line? Tiger is facing the reckoning that all young and powerful men face, the end of that youth and power, and a future spent figuring out how those things might be mourned and possibly replaced. This final comeback, if he ever gets healthy, will be his last.\n\n\"He knows,\" Begay says.\n\nTHE DECADE SEPARATING the cemetery in Kansas and the marina in the Bahamas has seen Tiger lose many of the things most important to him, and the more time passes, the more it's clear he left some essential part of himself there in the ground between Miles and Maude Woods. How did all he'd built come undone so quickly and so completely? That's the question that will shadow him for the rest of his life. The answer is complicated and layered. He fell victim to many things, some well-known and others deeply private: grief, loneliness, desire, freedom and his fixation with his father's profession, the military. These forces started working in Tiger's life almost as soon as his G-IV landed back in Orange County after he buried his father's ashes. The forces kept working until finally his wife found text messages from Rachel Uchitel on his phone and he ran his Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant (that car, incidentally, is owned by a man in rural Arkansas, who bought it used from a local dealer, neither of whom knew its own secret history).\n\nAfter Thanksgiving in 2009, his life split open in the most public and embarrassing way -- can you imagine having to talk about your sex life in a news conference with your mom in the front row? -- but that car crash wasn't the beginning of his unraveling. In an odd way, it was the end. Everything he's endured these past seven years, including admitting that his golf career might be finished, is a consequence of decisions he made in the three years after he lost Earl. He'd been hurtling toward that fire hydrant for a long time. On some level, he even understood what was happening to him, or at least was invested in understanding. There was a book in his car the night of the wreck, and it ended up on the floorboard, covered in shards of glass. Its title was Get a Grip on Physics.\n\nThe topic fascinated Woods. He'd long struggled to sleep, and when he wasn't texting or playing video games, he'd read, often military books about lone men facing impossible odds, such as Roberts Ridge or Lone Survivor, or books about theoretical physics and cosmology. The intro to Get a Grip laid out the basic rules of early science, from Newton and Galileo, focused on the concepts of friction and gravity. These had long interested him. Five-year-old Tiger once made a drawing that showed stickmen swinging different clubs, with the clubface sketched, as well as the flight path of the ball, including distance and apex.\n\nThat drawing is a window into something Woods himself perhaps still can't articulate; even at that age, he was curious enough to be thinking about physics. From the beginning, his golf talent has seemed to be an expression of his genius, not the genius itself. He is a remarkable person, and not because he once won 14 important golf tournaments, but because he thinks about how he came to occupy his particular space in the world. \"He certainly had his mind open to big questions, such as who he was, or who anyone was,\" says a close friend who requested anonymity, \"and had his mind open to the idea that sometimes the question is the answer.\" Six pages into Get a Grip, author John Gribbin sums up a truth governing both the world and the relationship between Earl and Tiger Woods: \"There was a fundamental law of nature which said that, left to their own devices, things move in circles.\"\n\nAct II\n\nTWENTY-FIVE DAYS after he buried his father and 15 before the 2006 U.S. Open, Tiger went back to visit the Navy SEALs, this time to a hidden mountain training facility east of San Diego. The place is known as La Posta, and it's located on a barren stretch of winding road near the Mexican border. Everything is a shade of muted tan and green, like Afghanistan, with boulders the size of cars along the highway.\n\nThis time, Tiger came to do more than watch.\n\nHe tried the SR-25 sniper rifle and the SEALs' pistol of choice, the Sig Sauer P226. One of the instructors was Petty Officer 1st Class John Brown, whose father also served as a Green Beret in Vietnam. Brown pulled Tiger aside. The sun was shining, a nice day, and the two men talked, standing on the northeast corner of a shooting facility.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Brown remembers asking.\n\n\"My dad,\" Tiger said, explaining that Earl had told him he'd either end up being a golfer or a special operations soldier. \"My dad told me I had two paths to choose from.\"\n\nBrown says Tiger seemed to genuinely want to know about their way of life. Tiger asked questions about Brown's family and they figured out that Brown's wife and Tiger shared the same birthday. Tiger told him not to ever try to match Michael Jordan drink for drink. They talked about Earl, and Brown felt like Tiger wanted \"safe harbor\" from his grief, a way to purge some of it even, to prove something to himself, or maybe prove something to the spirit of Earl, whose special ops career never approached the daring of a SEAL team.\n\n\"I definitely think he was searching for something,\" Brown says. \"Most people have to live with their regrets. But he got to experience a taste of what might have been.\"\n\nThe instructors gave Tiger camo pants and a brown T-shirt. He carried an M4 assault rifle and strapped a pistol to his right leg. On a strip of white tape above his right hip pocket, someone wrote \"TIGER.\" SEAL Ben Marshall (his name has been changed for this story because he remains on active duty) took Tiger to the Kill House, the high-stress combat simulator where SEALs practice clearing rooms and rescuing hostages. Marshall is a veteran of many combat deployments and was with Tiger making sure he didn't get too hurt. The instructors ran the golfer through the house over and over, lighting him up with Simunition, high-powered paint rounds that leave big, painful bruises. \"It was so much fun to hit him,\" Marshall says. \"He looked like a deer in the headlights. I was spraying him up like it was nothing.\"\n\nThe instructors set up targets, some of terrorists holding weapons and others of innocent civilians. Under fire and stress, Tiger needed to decide who should die and who should live. During one trip through the Kill House, the guys switched out a target of someone with a gun for one of a photographer, and when Tiger came through the door, he killed the person with the camera, according to two witnesses. The SEALs asked why he'd shot a civilian.\n\nFirst Tiger apologized for his mistake.\n\nThen he made a joke about hating photographers.\n\nEventually, Woods learned how to clear a room, working corners and figuring out lanes of fire, doing something only a handful of civilians are ever allowed to do: run through mock gun battles with actual Navy SEALs. \"He can move through the house,\" says Ed Hiner, a retired SEAL who helped oversee training during the time and wrote a book called First, Fast, Fearless. \"He's not freaking out. You escalate it. You start shooting and then you start blowing s--- up. A lot of people freak out. It's too loud, it's too crazy. He did well.\"\n\nAt one point, Marshall put him through a combat stress shooting course, making him carry a 30-pound ammunition box, do overhead presses with it, do pushups and run up a hill, with shooting mixed in. Tiger struggled with slowing his heart rate down enough to hit the targets, but he attacked the course.\n\n\"He went all out,\" Marshall said. \"He just f---ing went all out.\"\n\nMarshall got his golf clubs at one point and asked Tiger to sign his TaylorMade bag. Tiger refused, sheepishly, saying he couldn't sign a competing brand. So Marshall challenged him to a driving contest for the signature. Both Marshall and Brown confirmed what happened next: Tiger grinned and agreed. Some other guys gathered around a raised area overlooking the shooting range. Marshall went first and hit a solid drive, around 260 or 270 yards. Tiger looked at him and teed up a ball, gripping the TaylorMade driver.\n\nThen he got down on his knees.\n\nHe swung the club like a baseball bat and crushed one out past Marshall's drive. Tiger started laughing, and then all the SEALs started laughing, and eventually Marshall was laughing too.\n\n\"Well, I can just shoot you now and you can die,\" Marshall joked, \"or you can run and die tired.\"\n\nTHE MILITARY MEN and their bravado sent Tiger back in time to the Navy golf course with Earl and those salty retired soldiers and sailors. He missed his dad, of course, but he also missed the idea of Earl, which was as important as the man himself. Sometimes his dad traveled to tournaments and never visited the course, staying put at a hotel or rented house in case Tiger needed him. They could talk about anything, from the big questions of life, like Tiger's completely earnest belief in ghosts, to simple things a man should know, like how to order spacers of water between beers to keep from getting so drunk. (That last bit came about after a bad night at a Stanford fraternity party.) Without Earl, Tiger felt adrift and lonely. He threw himself back into his circus of a life, moving from place to place. And in the months after the funeral, the extramarital affairs either began or intensified. That summer of 2006, he met at least two of the mistresses who'd eventually hit the tabloids.\n\nTo be clear, he'd always talked a good game about women, long before he married Elin Nordegren in 2004. In 1999, in the quiet Oregon woods near the Deschutes River with Mark O'Meara and one of the best steelhead guides in the world, Tiger held court about the perks of being a professional athlete. \"I'm walking down the trail with him and he's bragging about his sexual conquests,\" says guide Amy Hazel. \"And this is when everybody thought he was the golden boy.\"\n\nHe told just filthy stories that Hazel wouldn't repeat, but even with the boasts and dirty jokes, she saw him as more of a big kid than a playboy. \"Nerdy and socially awkward\" are her words, and he seemed happiest standing in the river riffing lines from the Dalai Lama scene in Caddyshack.\n\nThe sexual bravado hid his awkwardness around women. One night he went to a club in New York with Derek Jeter and Michael Jordan. Jeter and Jordan circulated, talking with ease to one beautiful woman after another. (Both declined to comment about the episode.) At one point, Tiger walked up to them and asked the question that lives in the heart of every junior high boy and nearly every grown man too.\n\n\"What do you do to talk to girls?\"\n\nJeter and Jordan looked at each other, then back at Tiger, sort of stunned.\n\nGo tell 'em you're Tiger Woods, they said.\n\nIf Tiger was looking for something, it was seemingly lots of different things, finding pieces in a rotating cast of people. He and Rachel Uchitel bonded over their mutual grief. His fresh wounds from losing Earl helped him understand her scars from her father's cocaine overdose when she was 15, and her fianc\u00e9's death in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. The broken parts of themselves fit together, according to her best friend, Tim Bitici. Sometimes Rachel stayed with Tiger for days, Bitici says. Nobody ever seemed to ask Tiger where he was or what he was doing. Bitici went with Rachel down to Orlando to visit Tiger, who put them up in a condo near his house. When he came over, he walked in and closed all the blinds. Then he sat between Tim and Rachel on the couch and they all watched Chelsea Lately.\n\n\"This makes me so happy,\" Tiger said, according to Bitici.\n\nMany of these relationships had that odd domestic quality, which got mostly ignored in favor of the tabloid splash of threesomes. Tiger once met Jaimee Grubbs in a hotel room, she told a magazine, and instead of getting right down to business, they watched a Tom Hanks movie and cuddled. Cori Rist remembered breakfast in bed. \"It was very normal and traditional in a sense,\" she says. \"He was trying to push that whole image and lifestyle away just to have something real. Even if it's just for a night.\"\n\nMany times, he couldn't sleep.\n\nInsomnia plagued him, and he'd end up awake for days. Bitici says that Tiger asked Rachel to meet him when he'd gone too long without sleep. Only after she arrived could he nod off. Bitici thinks Tiger just wanted a witness to his life. Not the famous life people saw from outside but the real one, where he kept the few things that belonged only to him. This wasn't a series of one-night stands but something more complex and strange. He called women constantly, war-dialing until they picked up, sometimes just to narrate simple everyday activities. When they didn't answer, he called their friends. Sometimes he talked to them about Earl and his childhood.\n\nWe never see the past coming up behind because shaping the future takes so much effort. That's one of those lessons everyone must learn for themselves, including Tiger Woods. He juggled a harem of women at once, looking for something he couldn't find, while he made more and more time for his obsession with the military, and he either ignored or did not notice the repeating patterns from Earl's life. \"Mirror, mirror on the wall, we grow up like our daddy after all,\" says Paul Fregia, first director of the Tiger Woods Foundation. \"In some respects, he became what he loathed about his father.\"\n\n\u0093I definitely think he was searching for something. Most people have to live with their regrets. But he got to experience a taste of what might have been.\u0094\n\n- Petty Officer 1st Class John Brown on Tiger training with SEALs\n\nTHE MILITARY TRIPS continued through 2006 into 2007, kept almost completely a secret. At home, Tiger read books on SEALs and watched the documentary about BUD/S Class 234 over and over. He played Call of Duty for hours straight, so into the fantasy that his friends joked that after Tiger got shot in the game they might find him dead on the couch. When he could, he spent time with real-life operators. Tiger shot guns, learned combat tactics and did free-fall skydiving with active-duty SEALs. During one trip to La Posta, he remembered things they'd told him about their families, asking about wives, things he didn't do in the golf world; Mark O'Meara said Tiger never asks about his kids.\n\n\"If Tiger was around other professional athletes, storytelling would always have a nature of one-upmanship,\" a friend says. \"If Tiger was around some sort of active or retired military personnel, he was all ears. He was genuinely interested in what they had to say. Any time he told a military-related story that he had heard or talked about a tactic he had learned, he had a smile on his face. I can't say that about anything else.\"\n\nOne evening, Brown and two other guys put Tiger in the back seat of a king-cab pickup truck and drove him an hour and a half out into the desert to a training base named Niland, where a SEAL team was doing its final predeployment workup, staging a raid on a mock Afghan village that had been built down in a valley. They stood on a hill looking into the darkness. The SEAL platoon charged toward the position. Flares popped off, trailing into the darkness, and the valley rocked with the deep boom of artillery simulation and the chatter of small-arms fire. In the glow, Tiger looked transfixed. \"It was f---ing awesome,\" Brown says, laughing. \"I don't know if we just got a glimpse of him in a different light, but he just seemed incredibly humble, grateful.\"\n\nHis golfing team, particularly swing coach Hank Haney, understood the risk, sending a long email scolding Tiger for putting his career at risk: You need to get that whole SEALs thing out of your system. Haney does a lot of benefit work, including some for the special operations community, so stories would later trickle back to him about injuries suffered during training. Caddie Steve Williams thought the 2006 U.S. Open, where Tiger missed his first major cut as a pro, was the first time he'd ever seen Woods not mentally prepared. Tiger talked openly about the grief and loss he felt when he practiced, since that activity was so closely wound together with his memories of his dad.\n\nThe moments with the military added some joy to what he has repeatedly called the worst year of his life, and he chose to spend Dec. 30, 2006 -- his 31st birthday -- in San Diego skydiving with SEALs. This was his second skydiving trip; a month earlier, in the middle of a seven-tournament win streak, he'd gotten his free-fall USPA A-license, now able to jump without a tandem. Across the country, in Florida, his reps put a news release on his website, revealing for the first time that Elin was pregnant. Tiger Woods was going to be a father.\n\nElin came with him to San Diego on his birthday, and they rode south and east of the city, near a land preserve a few miles from Mexico, halfway between Chula Vista and Tecate. The road curved at banked angles, and up ahead a small airport came into view. Nichol's Field is a collection of maybe two dozen buildings. To the east of the property, a cluster of metal huts sat behind red stop signs: warning, restricted area. This was Tactical Air Operations, one of the places where the SEALs practice jumps. The main building felt like an inner sanctum: a SEAL flag on the wall and parachute riggings hung from the ceiling. They wore blue-and-white jumpsuits, Tiger and the three or four SEALs. He learned advanced air maneuvers. After each jump, the guys would tell Tiger what to do differently and he'd go off by himself for a bit to visualize the next jump and then go back up in the plane and dive into the air, doing everything they'd said. \"The dude's amazing,\" says Billy Helmers, a SEAL who jumped with him that day. \"He can literally think himself through the skydives.\"\n\nThe SEALs put a birthday cake on a table in one of the Tac Air buildings. It had a skydiver decorated on it in icing and read \"Happy Birthday, Tiger!\" The team guys and their families gathered around and sang \"Happy Birthday,\" and then Tiger leaned in and blew out his candles. Everyone took pictures, and in them Tiger is smiling, and it's not the grin that people know from commercials and news conferences. He looks unwatched and calm.\n\nWHILE HE MADE friends with some of the SEALs, many of their fellow operators didn't know why Tiger wanted to play soldier. It rubbed them the wrong way. Guys saw him doing the fun stuff, shooting guns and jumping out of airplanes, but never the brutal, awful parts of being a SEAL, soaking for hours in hypothermic waters, so covered in sand and grit that the skin simply grinds away. One year during hell week, a BUD/S candidate collapsed, his body temperature below 90 degrees; the man, a former wrestler, would rather have frozen to death than quit.\n\nWas Tiger willing to do that?\n\n\"Tiger Woods never got wet and sandy,\" says former SEAL and current Montana congressman Ryan Zinke, who ran the training facility during the years Tiger came around. The BUD/S instructors didn't like the way Tiger talked about how he'd have been a SEAL if he didn't choose golf. \"I just reached out to the guys I know who jumped with him and interacted with him,\" says a retired SEAL. \"Not a single one wants to have any involvement, or have their name mentioned in the press anywhere near his. His interactions with the guys were not always the most stellar, and most were very underwhelmed with him as a man.\"\n\nThen there's the story of the lunch, which spread throughout the Naval Special Warfare community. Guys still tell it, almost a decade later. Tiger and a group of five or six went to a diner in La Posta. The waitress brought the check and the table went silent, according to two people there that day. Nobody said anything and neither did Tiger, and the other guys sort of looked at one another.\n\nFinally one of the SEALs said, \"Separate checks, please.\"\n\nThe waitress walked away.\n\n\"We are all baffled,\" says one SEAL, a veteran of numerous combat deployments. \"We are sitting there with Tiger f---ing Woods, who probably makes more than all of us combined in a day. He's shooting our ammo, taking our time. He's a weird f---ing guy. That's weird s---. Something's wrong with you.\"\n\n\u0093It was very normal and traditional in a sense. He was trying to push that whole image and lifestyle away just to have something real. Even if it's just for a night.\u0094\n\n- Cori Rist, one of Tiger's mistresses\n\nTHEY'RE NOT WRONG, not exactly, but the SEALs are also viewing Tiger through their own pre-existing idea of how a superstar should act, so his behavior processes as arrogant and selfish. That reaction has colored Tiger's relationships his entire life: People who meet him for 30 seconds love him, and people who spend several hours with him think he's aloof and weird, while people who hang around long enough to know him end up both loving him and being oddly protective. His truest self is shy, awkward and basically well-intentioned, as unsuited for life in public as he is suited for hitting a ball.\n\n\"Frankly, the real Tiger Woods isn't that marketable,\" a friend says. \"There isn't a lot of money to be made off a guy who just wants to be left alone to read a book. Or left alone to play fetch with his dog. Or left alone to play with his kids. Or left alone to lift weights. Or left alone to play a video game. Do you see a trend? Tiger was a natural introvert, and the financial interest for him to be extroverted really drove a wedge in his personality. Being a celebrity changed him and he struggled with that -- and he struggled with the fact that he struggled with that.\"\n\nTiger uses well-rehearsed set pieces as standard icebreakers -- things that get trotted out again and again. Famously, in front of a GQ reporter in 1997, he told a joke that ended on a punch line about a black guy taking off a condom. He told the same joke in 2006 to a SEAL at a Navy shooting range and to a woman at Butter, a New York nightclub. Talk to enough people who've met him and it starts to seem like he's doing an impersonation of what he thinks a superstar athlete is supposed to be. Once he bought a Porsche Carrera GT, similar to the one driven by many celebrities, but one of the first times he got behind the wheel, the powerful car got away from him, spinning off into the grass near his house. He took it back to the dealership.\n\nTIGER BOUGHT A pair of combat boots. They were black, made by the tactical outfitter Blackhawk, popular with ex-special ops guys who become contractors and mercenaries. The boots were inevitable, in hindsight. You can't insert something as intense as the SEAL culture into the mind of someone like Tiger Woods and not have him chase it down a deep, dark hole. He started doing the timed 4-mile run in combat boots, required by everyone who wants to graduate from BUD/S. A friend named Corey Carroll, who refused to comment and whose parents lived near Tiger, did the workouts with him. They'd leave from Carroll's parents' home, heading north, out onto the golf course. The rare sighting was almost too strange to process: Tiger Woods in combat boots, wearing Nike workout pants or long combat-style trousers, depending on the weather, pounding out 8 1/2-minute miles, within striking distance of the time needed for BUD/S.\n\nTiger knew the SEAL physical requirements by heart, easily knocking out the pushups, pullups and situps. When he couldn't sleep, he'd end up at a nearby Gold's Gym at 3 a.m., grinding. One of his favorite workouts was the ladder, or PT pyramid, a popular Navy SEAL exercise: one pullup, two pushups, three situps, then two, four, six, up to 10, 20, 30 and back down again.\n\nSoon, the training at La Posta didn't cut it. He found something more intense with Duane Dieter, a man allowed by the Navy to train SEALs in a specialized form of martial arts that he invented. Dieter is a divisive figure in the special operations world, working out of his own training compound on the Maryland shore. His method is called Close Quarters Defense, or CQD, and some students look at him as an almost spiritual guide, like a modern samurai. Others think he's overrated. For Dieter, few things were more important than ancient warrior principles like light and dark energy.\n\nTiger got introduced by the Navy and learned CQD in Coronado. Hooked, he wanted to go further and ended up making trips to Dieter's compound in Maryland. He'd fly in and either stay at the facility or at the nearby fancy resort, Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond, according to a source who saw Tiger with Dieter. He'd park outside a nearby Target, sending someone else inside for cheap throwaway clothes that they could ruin with the Simunition. The practice rounds left huge bruises. He did all sorts of weapons training and fighting there, including this drill invented by Dieter: He would stand in a room, hands by his side, wearing a helmet with a protective face shield. A hood would be lowered over the helmet and loud white noise would play. It sounded like an approaching train, the speakers turning on and off at random intervals, lasting 30 seconds, or maybe just five. Then the hood would fly up and there would be a scenario. Maybe two people were talking. Or maybe one was a hostile and the other a hostage. If the people posed no threat, the correct response was to check corners and not draw your weapon. Then the hood would go back down, and there'd be more music, and when it came up, the scenario had changed. Sometimes a guy threw punches, to the body and head, and Tiger would need to free himself and draw his weapon. At first, the instructors went easy, not hitting him as hard as they'd hit a SEAL. Tiger put a stop to that and soon they jumped him as aggressively as everyone else. When the drill finally ended, the room smelled like gunpowder.\n\nAn idea began to take hold, a dream, really, one that could destroy the disconnect Tiger felt in his life, completely killing off the character he played in public. Maybe he could just disappear into the shadow world of special operations. He mentioned his plans to people around him, one by one. He pulled over a car at a tournament once and told Steve Williams he wanted to join the Navy. He told Haney he thought it would be cool to go through training. Once, Carroll had to talk him down via text message, according to someone present for the exchange, because Tiger wanted to quit golf and join the Navy. There's only one reason to run 4 miles in pants and combat boots. This wasn't some proto-training to develop a new gear of mental toughness. \"The goal was to make it through BUD/S,\" says a former friend who knew about the training. \"It had nothing to do with golf.\"\n\nTo many people inside Tiger's circle, Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 majors wasn't as important to Tiger as it was to the golfing media and fans. He never mentioned it. Multiple people who've spent significant amounts of time with him say that. When Tiger did talk about it, someone else usually brought it up and he merely responded. The record instead became something to break so he could chase something that truly mattered. He loved the anonymity of wearing a uniform and being part of a team. \"It was very, very serious,\" the friend says. \"If he had had a hot two years and broken the record, he would have hung up his clubs and enlisted. No doubt.\"\n\nTiger talked about some of these military trips with his friends, including describing skydiving to Michael Jordan, who saw a pattern repeating from his own past. Years before, he'd lost his father, and in his grief, he sought solace doing something his dad loved, quitting the Bulls and riding minor league buses for the Birmingham Barons. \"It could be his way of playing baseball,\" Jordan would say years later. \"Soothing his father's interest.\"\n\nJordan looked sad as he said this, perhaps feeling the heaviness of it all or even the luck involved. He somehow got through his grief and reclaimed his greatness, while Tiger has tried and failed over and over again.\n\n\"Ah, boy,\" Jordan sighed.\n\n\u0093If he had broken Nicklaus' record, Tiger would have hung up his clubs and enlisted. No doubt.\u0094\n\n- A friend of Tiger's\n\nTHE POINT OF no return came on July 31, 2007, a date that means nothing to the millions of fans who follow Tiger Woods but was the last real shot he had to avoid the coming storm. From the outside, he was closing in, inevitably, on Nicklaus. But inside his world, a year after his dad died, things were falling apart.\n\nOn June 18, Tiger became a father. In July, he flew a porn star to Washington, D.C., according to a tabloid, to meet him during his tournament, the AT&T National. He'd already met many of the mistresses who would come forward two years later. According to The Wall Street Journal, the summer of 2007 is when the National Enquirer contacted his camp to say it had caught him in an affair with a Perkins waitress. Negotiations allegedly began that would kill the tabloid story if Tiger agreed to sit for an interview and cover shoot with Men's Fitness, owned by the same parent company as the Enquirer. He did. The magazine hit newsstands on June 29.\n\nOn July 22, he finished tied for 12th at the Open Championship, and then came home. In the weeks afterward, he'd announce that he'd ruptured his left ACL while jogging in Isleworth. His news release did not mention whether he'd been running in sneakers or combat boots. At the time, he chose to skip surgery and keep playing. Tiger's account might be true, as might the scenario laid out in Haney's book: that he tore the ACL in the Kill House with SEALs. Most likely, they're both right. The knee suffered repeated stresses and injuries, from military drills and elite-level sports training and high-weight, low-rep lifting. A man who saw him doing CQD training says, \"It's kind of funny, when you have an injury it almost seems like a magnet for trauma. He almost never had something hit his right knee. It was always his left knee that got kicked, or hit, or shot, or landed on. Always the left knee.\"\n\nWhatever happened, he didn't take a break. Two days before the tournament in Akron, he was in Ohio. That night, July 31, his agent, Mark Steinberg, had people over to his home near Cleveland, including Tiger. According to both Haney's and Williams' books, Steinberg said the time had come for an intervention over Tiger's military adventures. While Steinberg has a reputation as a bully in the golf world, he cares a great deal about his client and friend. This all must have seemed insane to someone who just wanted to manage a great athlete: secret trips to military facilities, running around a golf course in combat boots, shooting guns, taking punches.\n\nThat night after dinner, Steinberg took Tiger into his downstairs office, a room in his finished basement. What they talked about remains private. But this was the moment when Tiger could have connected the dots and seen how out of control things had become. Everyone felt good about the talk. Afterward, Haney wrote, Tiger was different and the military trips became less of a distraction.\n\nThat's what they thought.\n\nConsider Tiger Woods once more, tabloids snapping grainy long-distance photos, his marriage suddenly in danger and with it the normalcy he lacked everywhere else, his body taking a terrible beating from SEAL training and aggressive weightlifting, a year after losing his father, adrift and yet still dominating all the other golfers in the world. They never were his greatest opponent, which was and always will be a combination of himself and all those expectations he never could control. Tiger won Akron, then won his 13th career major the following week at the PGA Championship in Tulsa, and then, 15 hours after getting home from the tournament, he packed up and flew off again to do CQD training with Dieter. Steinberg's warning was just 13 days old.\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE MIGHT as well have been chiseled in stone on the day he was born. The two knee surgeries in Park City, Utah, a year later. The three back surgeries. The Thanksgiving night he took an Ambien and forgot to erase his text messages, and how that enormous storm started small, with Elin calling numbers in his phone, confronting the people on the other end, including Uchitel's friend Tim Bitici, who was in Vermont with his family when his phone rang. The horrors big and small that followed. The butcher paper taped up over the windows to block the paparazzi. The sheet his crew hung over the name of his yacht. The internet comments he read while driving to Augusta National before the 2010 Masters, obsessed over what people thought. The questions from his kids about why Mommy and Daddy don't live together, and the things he won't be able to protect them from when their classmates discover the internet. The tournament where he shot a 42 on the front nine and withdrew, blaming knee and Achilles injuries.\n\nThat day, Steve Williams saw a friend in the parking lot.\n\n\"What happened?\" his friend asked, incredulous.\n\n\"I think he's got the yips, mate,\" Williams replied.\n\nIn the 1,303 days between his father's death and the fire hydrant, Tiger set in motion all those things, and when he can finally go back and make a full accounting of his life, he'll realize that winning the 2008 U.S. Open a year before the scandal, with a broken leg and torn ACL, was the closest he ever got to BUD/S. He could barely walk and he still beat everyone in the world. He won and has never been the same. The loneliness and pain tore apart his family, and the injuries destroyed his chance to beat Nicklaus and to leave fame behind and join the Navy. He lost his dad, and then his focus, and then his way, and everything else came falling down too.\n\nBut first, he got one final major.\n\n\"I'm winning this tournament,\" he told his team.\n\n\"Is it really worth it, Tiger?\" Steve Williams asked.\n\n\"F-- you,\" Tiger said.",

Here's a timeline of the key events in the story so far.\n\nDec 2013: Faced with the threat of being ousted from the Olympics, FILA (the world wrestling body), now United World Wrestling, decides to scrap some weight categories making it a 6-6-6 format for men's freestyle, women's freestyle and greco-roman. One of the categories axed from the Games is the 66 kg category in which double Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar competed and excelled in. Sushil decides to move to the 74 kg freestyle category.\n\nJuly 2014: Sushil competes in the new weight category for the first time at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and wins gold. Skips the Asian Games the same year in which Narsingh Yadav, who had bagged gold in the 74 kg freestyle event at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, wins a bronze in Incheon. Sushil does not compete in any further events citing injury.\n\nSept 2015: Narsingh wins a bronze at the World Championships in the 74 kg freestyle category event in Las Vegas, earning India a quota at the Rio Olympics.\n\nDec 2015: Faced with a possibility of a face-off with Narsingh, Sushil pulls out of the Pro Wrestling League (PWL). Narsingh was a part of the Bengaluru Yodhas, who lost to Mumbai Garudas in the semi final despite Narsingh winning his bout 7-0.\n\nMay 2016: Sushil turns vocal in his demand for trials with Narsingh to pick who gets to go to the Olympics.\n\nMay 13: Sushil intensifies his campaign, takes to social media, appealing to the PMO and sports ministry requesting intervention.\n\nMay 15: In a body blow to his hopes, Sushil's name is excluded from Wrestling Federation of India's (WFI) list of wrestlers for the preparatory camp in Sonepat. WFI justifies its move saying that wrestlers who have won an Olympic quota place were included and hints that Narsingh, who has a podium finish in every tournament he has participated in over the last two years, has their backing.\n\nMay 16: Sushil moves to Delhi High Court seeking the conduct of a trial bout with Narsingh.\n\nMay 17: Court refuses to intervene, directs the WFI to meet the wrestler and sort out the matter.",

    "raw_text": "Aman Sehrawat is a man on a mission in Paris: to keep alive Indian wrestling's medalling streak at the Olympics. Fighting in the 57kg category (his idol Ravi Dahiya's), he was looking to emulate Ravi's silver.\n\nAman was clear about what he wanted to do from the off in the first round: attack. Up first was Macedonia's Vladimir Egorov, a gold medallist at the 2022 European Championships. Aman gave him a minute to settle down and used his long levers to execute a takedown as Egorov was put on the activity clock. Aman struck with another swooping takedown and got a step-out point as well as a passivity point which handed him a 6-0 lead at the interval.\n\nHe had barely broken a sweat. He calmly sipped on water as he got his arms massaged at the break, while the Macedonian camp discussed the way back into the contest. Their plans materialized to nothing, however, as Aman was in no mood to indulge. Within a minute of the second period, Aman had two more takedowns and the bout to his name.\n\nHe was back on the mat within the hour and he had a familiar opponent across him: Zelimkhan Abakarov of Albania. The last time the two met, the Russian-born Albanian had trapped Aman in a leg-lace and rolled him around five times. It's the most embarrassing way to lose a bout - you're just there, feet trapped, with nowhere to go as your opponent rolls you on the mat like a rag doll.\n\nThat defeat stung Aman. Amends had to be made. 124 seconds is all Aman needed. He scored off a takedown to set the pace and did to Abakarov what he had done to him last year: roll him around the mat.\n\nAman used his long levers to inflict a single-leg takedown and then grabbed onto Abakarov's ankles to leg lace him forward thrice and a reverse leg lace closed out the contest. Not that it was very competitive. It was Aman's second win via technical superiority. Aman, though, hardly looked impressed. He got up and walked to the centre of the mat like nothing had happened, while Abakarov sat there stunned.\n\nIt was an exhibition of attacking wrestling. Aman showed just why he is considered among the best wrestlers in the men's 57kg. And he will have to prove himself once again later this evening when he takes on the top seed in Rei Higuchi. The Japanese wrestler won silver at the 2016 Olympics and a silver at the 2023 Worlds. Higuchi convincingly beat him at the Hungary Ranking Series in June.\n\nFollow that match live right here at 9:45 PM\n\nAman goes into the bout as the underdog, but as the writing in his room says, \"If it was easy, everyone would do it.\"",

    "raw_text": "The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland has accepted Vinesh Phogat's appeal over her disqualification from the 2024 Paris Olympics and will make a decision before the culmination of the Games. The matter has been referred to the Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett AC SC, sitting as a Sole Arbitrator, who will hold a hearing with the parties on Friday.\n\nThe Sole Arbitrator's decision is expected to be issued before the end of the Games. Former Solicitor General of India, Harish Salve, will represent the Indian Olympic Association at the hearing.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nIn a statement, the CAS said that Vinesh had not requested for urgent interim measures, and that it would not have been possible considering the respondents (UWW, the world wrestling federation) would also needed to be heard first. \"The procedure is, however, ongoing and the Applicant has confirmed that she seeks the annulment of the Challenged Decision and that she requests to be awarded a (shared) silver medal,\" it read.\n\nThe grounds for appeal by Vinesh's team are understood to rest on these points: Vinesh won three bouts on August 6 with her weight within the limit, and therefore her entry to the final was legal. After those three bouts she needed to hydrate and eat to a sufficient quantity for her body to recover, so the weight she regained was not in the nature of giving her an advantage but part of an essential recovery process. Vinesh was disqualified from the Olympics on the morning of her gold medal bout, after failing to make weight, reportedly 100 grams over the weight limit.\n\nVinesh had weighed in at 49.9kg on the morning of her first bout and went on to reach the final after three bouts, but weighed 52.7kg by the end of day's play. After a sleepless night where drastic measures were taken to make weight, Vinesh weighed in at 50.1kg on the morning of her gold medal bout, and was subsequently disqualified as per UWW (United World Wrestling) rules.\n\nFollowing Vinesh's disqualification, Yusneylys Guzman Lopez of Cuba (whom Vinesh had defeated in her semifinal) replaced her in the gold medal bout, which was won by Sarah Hildebrandt of the USA. Vinesh's appeal is to be awarded a joint silver medal.\n\nExplained: Why was Vinesh Phogat disqualified from Paris Olympics? How does wrestling weigh-in work?\n\nCAS has already intervened at the Paris Olympics in the men's doubles badminton event, allowing French duo Lucas Corvee and Ronan Labar to feature after a BWF (Badminton World Federation) error initially excluded them from the draw.\n\nVinesh had announced her retirement from wrestling on Thursday, saying she had no strength left to continue. Posting to social media, Vinesh wrote \"Ma, wrestling has won, I have lost. Please forgive me, your dreams and my courage, everything is broken. I don't have any more strength now. Goodbye wrestling 2001-2024. I shall be indebted to you all. Forgive (me).\"",

Naveen has been to this season what Pawan Kumar Sehrawat was to the last edition, perhaps a little bit better in terms of consistency, with 21 Super 10s from 22 matches.

In the semifinal against Bengaluru Bulls, he managed a few tackles on Pawan. In the previous match between the two teams, he was instrumental in keeping Sehrawat consigned to the bench for a significant amount of time as well.\n\nSukesh Hegde (Bengal Warriors): Although far from the most substantial contributor in terms of points scored, Hegde has been particularly useful in Bengal's last few matches, scoring vital raid points in the absence of captain and lead raider Maninder Singh due to injury concerns. He was the team's top raider - with eight points - in the semifinal win.\n\nWild card",

    "raw_text": "India's Hokato Hotozhe Sema won bronze in the men's F57 shotput with a sensational throw of 14.65m that considerably bettered his previous personal best. With the pressure on him, Hokato was able to bring out his very best to seal the medal.\n\nCompatriot Soman Rana finished fifth, while gold was taken by an imperious Yasin Khosravi of Iran and silver went to Brazil's Thiago dos Santos.\n\nPARALYMPICS 2024 KEY DATES | EVERY MEDAL WON BY INDIA AT THE PARALYMPICS | PARALYMPIC CLASSIFICATIONS EXPLAINED\n\nIt was a competition that started with a real statement of intent. In one of the great showings at this, or indeed any Paralympic Games, Khosravi came and with each of his six throws hurled the shot put farther than the previous Paralympics Record. Have a look at his sequence: 15.26m, 15.87m, 15.94m, 15.96m, 15.57m, 15.94m. The worst of his throws was still 0.20m more than the silver winning throw.\n\nWith the gold already sewn up and dos Santos' 15.06m looking pretty far away, the real battle was on for bronze. Soman went first but a poor series of throws, well below his best, saw him hit a best of only 14.07m. That was beaten on his first attempt by Finland's Teijo Koopikka who hit 14.18m (his best on the evening also).\n\nHokato followed the two immediately and while his start was slow, built up steam by mid-way, throwing 14.40m to overtake Koopikka before unfurling his best ever throw, hitting 14.65m... a distance that proved too far for any of the athletes that came after him.\n\nThe F57 is a classification for those that participate in a seated position, and that tells you just how tough the event can be. Where shot put throwers generally generate momentum by spinning and stepping fast, powering themselves from the ground up, this seated position demands that the athlete generate all that power from their upper body alone -- which they achieve by leaning back impossibly and using their mammoth shoulders and arms to throw the shot put great distances.\n\nAnd throw it a great distance is exactly what Hokato did.\n\nNagaland's only Paralympian, Hokato is an Indian army soldier who lost his leg to a land mine blast during operations in 2002. This led to the amputation of his left leg, and that was a surgery that Hokato took quite a while to recover from. It was not just the immense physical recovery needed that took a toll, but the mental and psychological effect of going from the peak of human physical fitness to becoming an amputee.\n\nHe struggled to deal with this for years, and while still with the army in an administrative role, the Army's Para Sports Node came calling. After a fair bit of convincing, Hokato gave it a try and focused on shot put to maximise his immense upper body strength. That was eight years ago, and he's steadily risen through the para-sporting ranks since. With the competitive juices flowing the soldier then went on a mission of improvement. In 2023 he won his first big international medal, bronze at the Asian Games, before coming close to repeating the trick at the 2024 World Championships (where he finished fourth).\n\nIn Paris, though, there was no denying him. With Soman's disappointing series hanging as a cloud, he brushed aside the pressure of performing at the sport's biggest stage, and pulled out the very best he is capable of. His throw of 14.65m was exactly the kind of throw that Paralympians dream of achieving once the spotlight is on them and he will return home to India a Paralympic medalist on his debut attempt.",

I speak with these players, not every day like Richard [Hughes] but quite a lot.\n\n\"It would be ridiculous if in all those times we have not spoken about the future. Of course we do.

    "raw_text": "Simran Sharma came on to the track for the women's 200m T12 final at the Paris Paralympics as the reigning world champion. Less than 25 seconds later, she was a Paralympic medallist for the first time, winning the bronze with a new personal best time.\n\nShe and her guide Abhay Singh -- the 24-year-old Simran competes in the category for the partially visually impaired -- shaved 0.20 seconds in a terrific sprint to reach the podium, just two days ago after facing the heartbreak of fourth in the 100m T12 race, and that by a mere 0.05 seconds.\n\nShe put that disappointment behind to clock 24.75 seconds and win the bronze that took India's medal tally up to a record-extending 29. Cuba's Omara Durand Elias, the undisputed GOAT of this event (who was injured during the last World Championships), won gold with a time of 23.62s while Venezuela's Alejandra Paola Perez Lopez won silver. Hajar Safarzadeh, who had beaten Simran to silver at last year's Para Asian Games, finished fourth. Both Lopez and Hajar beat their personal bests too.\n\nPARALYMPICS 2024 KEY DATES | EVERY MEDAL WON BY INDIA AT THE PARALYMPICS | PARALYMPIC CLASSIFICATIONS EXPLAINED\n\nFor Simran it was a remarkable run. It takes immense determination to better your personal best by 0.20 seconds in sprints in the brightest of spotlights. Her semifinal time was 25.03 seconds and in the heats, she clocked 25.41 seconds. To then run her best for the medal was a huge effort. She had similarly run her then personal best of 24.95 seconds to win the World Championships gold medal earlier this year in Kobe, Japan.\n\nTo keep registering your personal best on the biggest of stages says something about the mentality of an athlete. And Simran, who was born prematurely and survived weeks in an incubator, is nothing if not determined.\n\nThe 24-year-old from Ghaziabad was encouraged to and competed in extra-curricular sports all her life despite her vision challenges, before discovering para sports around 2019. And yet when she competed at the 2019 World Para Athletics Championship, she had to deal with her father battling a chronic illness and his death soon after.\n\nSimran also had faced financial struggles to train early on but that's when she met Gajender Singh, a fellow athlete and a soldier in the Indian Army. He became her coach and is now her husband. He has taken out loans to help her training since the time she got her license to compete in para-athletics.\n\nShe has been competing on the circuit for a few years now, qualifying for the Tokyo Games where she finished 11th in the 100m T12. But 2024 has the been the year the 24-year-old has made her big breakthrough, first with the World Championship gold in May and now a Paralympics medal in September.\n\nInterestingly, her guide in Paris, Abhay Singh is also an India international sprinter. He holds U18 national record holder for 200m and won bronze at the 2023 Asian U18 Championships and that technical ability showed as he kept stride superbly with Simran.\n\nWith the talent and determination, they possess, it's only fair to say that we will be hearing from Simran and Abhay.",

Multiple reports late on Wednesday night suggest that Vinesh has requested a joint silver medal and CAS has asked till Thursday morning to reply to the appeal.\n\nAn Ad hoc Division of the CAS has been set up in Paris for resolution by arbitration of any disputes arising during the Olympic Games or during a period of 10 days preceding the Opening Ceremony.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nVinesh had been disqualified on Wednesday morning after failing to make the correct weight on day 2 of competition when she was due to take part in the final, despite the best efforts of her team overnight. As a result of the disqualification, Vinesh was placed last in the category and her place in the final was taken by the Cuban Guzman Lopez, whom Vinesh had beaten in the semifinal. Additionally, both Yui Susaki and Oksana Livach, whom Vinesh had beaten in the first two rounds, contested a bronze medal bout between each other in the repechage due to the Cuban moving into the final.\n\nExplained: Why was Vinesh Phogat disqualified from Paris Olympics? How does wrestling weigh-in work?\n\nESPN understands that the appeal was made this evening, through the Indian Olympic Association. The IOA President PT Usha also met Vinesh at the Olympic Village's medical centre this afternoon, where she was said to have been injected with intravenous fluids to rehydrate after the rigorous process she underwent to lose weight.\n\nVinesh was within the permissible weight limit of 50kg on Tuesday morning before her first day of competition. Her weight increased through the day as she replenished herself in between the three bouts. It is understood she had to lose about 2kg overnight. Despite having worked all night, the Indian eventually fell short by about 100 grams this morning.\n\nCAS has already intervened in this Olympic Games - French badminton players Lucas Corv\u00e9e and Ronan Labar had been included in a revised men's doubles draw after a CAS intervention. The draw was expanded to 17 pairs to accommodate them after BWF failed to add them due to a calculation error.\n\nWhat does the rule say?\n\nArticle 11 of the United World Wrestling's rule book says an athlete who doesn't make the weight cut will be eliminated from the competition. \"If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated of the competition and ranked last, without rank.\"\n\nBy the above law, Vinesh's disqualification seems to have been taken by the book, but now it is understood that CAS will issue an interim order on Thursday morning.",

    "raw_text": "At the Paris Olympics in August, Lakshya Sen was the best performing Indian badminton player reaching the bronze medal match and finishing an agonising fourth. That run, which saw him beat three higher-ranked players and come close to a medal, elevated him in the national sporting consciousness as a future champion (a thought reasserted by eventual gold medallist Viktor Axelsen).\n\nThree months later, Lakshya is struggling to put together a win. In his latest outing at the Japan Masters on Wednesday, the Indian world no. 17 went down to world no. 31 Leong Jun Hao 22-20, 17-21, 16-21 in a match that lasted 75 minutes and saw Lakshya gain the upper hand multiple times only to squander it away. had a hard-fought, one game lead against an opponent who he has a 3-1 record against, and then a 10-6 advantage in the decider, but he just couldn't close it out.\n\nIn isolation, this result after a month-long break doesn't look as bad. But the fact that Lakshya has yet to win a match after the Olympics is bordering on cause of concern.\n\nHe took a break of two months after the Olympic heartbreaks, recovering and then working on his fitness at the Red Bull Athlete Performance Centre in Salzburg before returning for the European in October. He had opening round walkover at the Arctic Open Super 500 but then lost to lost to Chou Tien Chen from a game up, the same opponent he'd beaten to reach the Olympic semis playing one of his career's best matches. The following week he lost his opener to Lu Guang Zu at the Denmark Open Super 750, once again from a game up.\n\nNow, a month and another training block later, Lakshya finds himself back at the three-game loss threshold. In none of these matches, can one say that he was playing badly or was not in with a chance. It's this losing from advantageous positions that's become a worry for the 23-year-old.\n\nOn Wednesday against Leong, Lakshya was all quick feet and swift rallies, playing a very good level of badminton and showing little sign of having been away from the court. After a slightly slower start, he got into his pace and neither player could hold on to serve till 12-12. It's then that the Malaysian built a run of points and the Indian's focus jangled. There were multiple failed smashed and avoidable errors. But the way he clinched the first game from 18-20 down to 22-20 was classic Lakshya, making the runs, erasing the deficit and getting the points.\n\nIn the second game, the Indian had to catch up and erase the deficit several times, but every time Leong pulled ahead, Lakshya was able to stay close. Until he made on too many errors on judgment calls. The Malaysian managed to punch in a number of winners on open court, not an easy feat against a Lakshya's quality defence but that's where his lapses showed.\n\nIn the decider though, it was Lakshya who was setting the pace again and staying ahead till the mid point. But the final change of ends, after more than an hour of play, it was Lakshya who plateaued, and Leong's relentless pressure -- the precise touch finding the lines and quick movement to match -- prevailed.\n\nTwo things sorely stood out in his match for Lakshya -- the spate of errors while he tried to shift to a more attacking mode and the soft points he conceded after defending for his life in hard rallies. The smashes that fell just wide, the errors at the net when going for the kill, the last shot in a long rally when he ran all over court, it all piled up and made him stumble. As mentioned in our preview, while there is no doubt that Lakshya can challenge the best, his mental blocks seem to have become an even bigger issue after the fourth-place finish in Paris.\n\nThis is certainly not the first time it happened and Lakshya has overcome this successfully is the past, most strikingly at the start of the year when he went on a big run to qualify for the Olympics after seven straight first-round exits on tour. What he then did in Paris was even more memorable. He just needs to tap into that level of confidence and get that habit of winning again. The only way to do it to win a close match and the only one who can do it is Lakshya, as his childhood coach Vimal Kumar had notably said earlier this year.\n\nHe still has a chance to do that, next week at the Super 750 in China which will end the top-tier tournaments for 2024, and then the Syed Modi Super 300 back home. And he will hope to do that to finish off the season on a positive note. For now, Lakshya's breakthrough Olympic season looks to be bookended by two confidence-crisis slumps.",

    "raw_text": "Dominant. That's the best word to define Praveen Kumar's gold medal in the men's T64 high jump at the Paris Paralympics 2024. Just take this fact, for instance: Praveen cleared his seven heights in a single jump. Heights of 1.89m, 1.93m, 1.97m, 2.00m, 2.03m, 2.06m and 2.08m, all in one go. Dominant, capital D. By the time he experienced his first failure in the final -- 2.10m -- he had already won the gold medal.\n\nPARALYMPICS 2024 KEY DATES | EVERY MEDAL WON BY INDIA AT THE PARALYMPICS | PARALYMPIC CLASSIFICATIONS EXPLAINED\n\nAt just 21, he is now a double Paralympic medalist. He wiped the floor with the competition to win this gold, an upgrade on the silver he won in Tokyo. This was India's sixth gold at these Games and the tally now reads 26 medals. USA's Derek Loccident took the silver while the bronze was shared between Uzbekistan's Giyazov Temurbek and Poland's Maciej Lepiato.\n\nBut the competition wasn't even close. The 2.08m height that Praveen cleared is the new Asian record and improves his personal best (from 2.07m).\n\nConsidering his pedigree and his previous Paralympics performance, Praveen was always in the mix for the medal in the event. However, just this year he had finished fourth at the World Championships with a best clearance of 1.94m. He had improved his season's best to 2.05m but the kind of dominance he showed on Friday was surprising to say the least considering the field he was in: one that included Tokyo gold medallist Jonathan Broom-Edwards of Great Britain and bronze winner Maciej.\n\nBroom-Edwards couldn't repeat his Tokyo showing and finished fifth with a best jump of 1.89m. Meanwhile, both Giyazov and Loccident came up with new personal best jumps but still couldn't topple Praveen.\n\nIn a way, though, it's not surprising either. That's because since his entry into the sport, Praveen has always been seen as a hugely talented athlete capable of breaking records. At Tokyo, he became India's youngest para-athlete to win a medal (with an Asian record to boot), at just 18. It's a testament to his talent because he took up the sport only in 2019 and qualified for the biggest competition in the world after a few months.\n\nIn the same year, he won the bronze medal at the Junior Para World Championship. Praveen, belonging to a village close to Noida, was born with a short leg. In sports, his first love was volleyball. \"I used to play volleyball in school but gradually I got into para-athletics and took part in the high jump event. I came to know about the Paralympics through [an internet] search and found out how to reach there.\"\n\nThe first ever high jump event that he participated in was for able bodied athletes and Praveen quickly realised that he has an opportunity to excel in para-athletics. Training under coach Satyapal Singh, Praveen started participating in the junior competitions. It didn't take him long to make an impression in the senior events.\n\nAfter the heights of the Tokyo medal, Praveen continued his rising route and won gold at the Asian Para Games in Hangzhou, breaking the Games record by clearing 2.02m in the final. In 2022, he even went on to win the gold medal at the 20th National Federation Cup Junior U-20 Championship: an event for able-bodied athletes.\n\nConsidering what we have seen of Praveen through his short career, there's no doubt that he has many more years in him at the top level. At 21, he's already a legend... and is now on his way to achieve unprecedented heights.",

This is the second time the deadline has been extended for the ad-hoc division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to announce its verdict.\n\nThe unprecedented disqualification has now given rise to an extraordinary and unexplained delay; the disqualification was on August 7 and the appeal was filed the same day.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS\n\n\"The CAS ad hoc division president has allowed Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett, Sole Arbitrator in the Vinesh Phogat vs. United World Wrestling (UWW) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) matter, an extension until 6-00 p.m. (Paris time) on Friday, August 16, 2024,\" a release from the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said.\n\nIn what added to the mystery surrounding the case, a scheduled press conference (via Zoom) with IOA president PT Usha and Harish Salve, representing the association in the case, was cancelled without any explanation or update. Reporters who clicked on the meeting link at the scheduled time got an \"invalid\" message.\n\nVinesh was disqualified on August 7, when she was 100 grams above the weight limit of 50kgs. She had weighed in at 49.9kg on the morning of her first bout and went on to reach the final after three bouts but weighed 52.7kg by the end of day's play.\n\nAfter a sleepless night where drastic measures were taken to make weight, Vinesh weighed in at 50.1kg on the morning of her gold medal bout and was subsequently disqualified as per UWW (United World Wrestling) rules, which states that an athlete who doesn't make the weight cut will be eliminated from the competition.\n\nExplained: Why was Vinesh Phogat disqualified from Paris Olympics? How does wrestling weigh-in work?\n\nFollowing Vinesh's disqualification, Yusneylys Guzman Lopez of Cuba (whom Vinesh had defeated in her semifinal) replaced her in the gold medal bout, which was won by Sarah Hildebrandt of the USA.\n\nVinesh had appealed to the CAS late on August 7 over her disqualification and the CAS accepted her appeal before referring the case to Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett AC SC, sitting as a Sole Arbitrator.\n\nVinesh was represented by a group of pro bono French lawyers who are part of a panel set up for the Olympics to fight urgent cases that come before CAS. The IOA, which is an interested party in the case, was represented by Harish Salve and Vidushpat Singhania. Vinesh subsequently announced her retirement from wrestling on August 8, saying she had no strength left to continue.\n\nThe Sole Arbitrator held a hearing with the parties on August 8 and a verdict was to be announced before the Games ended. However, a statement from the IOA said the verdict would be announced on August 9, which it rectified later by saying that the deadline was for the parties to submit additional documents and that the final verdict would only be known only on Tuesday.\n\nThe grounds for appeal by Vinesh's team are understood to rest on these points: she won three bouts on August 6 with her weight within the limit, and therefore her entry to the final was legal. After those three bouts she needed to hydrate and eat to a sufficient quantity for her body to recover, so the weight she regained was not in the nature of giving her an advantage but part of an essential recovery process.",

    "raw_text": "Vinesh Phogat has announced her retirement after her disqualification from the Olympics, saying she doesn't have the strength to continue. The 29-year-old, who was disqualified for being 100gm overweight ahead of her 50kg category gold medal bout on Wednesday, announced her decision via social media.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nAddressing her mother Premlata, Vinesh wrote, \"Ma, wrestling has won, I have lost. Please forgive me, your dreams and my courage, everything is broken. I don't have any more strength now. Goodbye wrestling 2001-2024. I shall be indebted to you all. Forgive (me),\" added the two-time world championships bronze-medallist.\n\nVinesh appealed against her disqualification from the Olympic finals on Wednesday in the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), demanding that she be awarded a joint silver medal.\n\nShe spent a good part of the day at a polyclinic inside the Games village owing to severe dehydration caused by her desperate measures to make the cut, which included going hungry, avoiding fluids and staying up all night to sweat it out.\n\nAn ad-hoc division of the CAS had been set up in Paris for resolution by arbitration of any disputes arising during the Olympic Games or during a period of 10 days preceding the Opening Ceremony. Vinesh's appeal was to be taken up in the next few hours.\n\nExplained: Why was Vinesh Phogat disqualified from Paris Olympics? How does wrestling weigh-in work?\n\nCuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, who lost to Vinesh in the semifinals, replaced her in the final against American Sarah Ann Hildebrandt. Hidebrandt won the bout to claim gold and Vinesh is now banking on CAS to be a joint silver-medallist with Lopez.\n\nHowever, the sport's international governing body, United World Wrestling (UWW) has made it clear on its part that the current weigh-in rule cannot be changed as of now. \"On IOA's suggestion that a wrestler's results from the day on which the athlete met the weigh-in requirements should not be disqualified, the UWW President was sympathetic.\n\n\"UWW will also discuss the suggestion at an appropriate platform but it could not be done retrospectively,\" the world body said in a statement late on Wednesday after its President Nenad Lalovic met IOA chief P T Usha.\n\nVinesh had scripted history by becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the gold medal bout in her category on Tuesday night. She was assured of at least a silver medal before the disqualification.\n\nHaryana Chief Minister Nayab Saini announced that Vinesh would be received as a medal-winner back home, saying \"Our brave daughter of Haryana, Vinesh Phogat, performed brilliantly and entered the finals of the Olympics. Due to some reasons, she may not have been able to play the final of the Olympics, but she is a champion for all of us.\"\n\n\"Our government has decided that Vinesh Phogat will be welcomed and felicitated like a medallist. All the respect, rewards and facilities that the Haryana government gives to an Olympic silver medallist will be gratefully given to Vinesh Phogat as well. We are proud of you Vinesh!\"\n\nVinesh retires as a three-time Olympian and has won gold medals in both the Asian and Commonwealth Games. For the past one year, she had also been the face of fierce protests against former Wrestling Federation of India head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexual harassment.",

    "raw_text": "That is very much that, then. Across a 24-page document, sole arbitrator Annabelle Bennett comprehensively recorded Vinesh Phogat's case at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and ended it with her final decision: \"In view of the above considerations, the Applicant's Application filed on 7 August 2024 shall be dismissed.\" No joint-silver, nothing, as we had predicted since CAS released its brief verdict on August 14.\n\nThere is, though, a potential silver lining here, because a reading of the detailed judgement shows there is scope for a relook at the laws that govern weigh-ins at big wrestling events. Vinesh will not get her medal, but similar incidents can be prevented in the future.\n\nThere are enough indications in the detailed verdict that Bennett disagreed with the rules but, as she explained, her hands were tied. This was the most striking: \"The consequences of the failed second weigh-in, which do not arise from any illegal or wrongful act on the part of the Applicant are, in the opinion of the Sole Arbitrator, draconian.\"\n\nSince the validity of said rule was not being contested, she said, there was nothing much she could do about it; instead, she subtly put the onus on United World Wrestling (UWW), the global governing body, to revisit its laws.\n\nVinesh's ouster may have been correct as per the rules, as Bennett pointed out, but the outpouring of support and empathy for her from across the world of wrestling and beyond suggests it's time for a change. Here are some rules the UWW could start with.\n\nOne-day weigh-in as opposed to two-day weigh-ins\n\nVinesh competed on August 6 at the Paris Olympics because she made the weigh-in on the first day. That much is accepted by all parties. Now, why does wrestling mandate a second weigh-in for a competitor who's already made the cut for the first bout? Considering the health risks associated with weight cuts, wouldn't it be advisable to have the athlete continue through the tournament without any further weigh-ins? Especially since it's just a two-day affair.\n\nWrestling had always been a single-day affair from the first round to the final until 2017 when the two-day format was introduced. Under the new rule, a strict no-allowance weigh-in on the first day was followed by a weigh-in on the second day that had a two-kilogram allowance.\n\nSkipping, sauna, sparring, cutting her hair: How Vinesh tried to get her weight down\n\nRather ironically, one of the highlighted aims for that change was to reduce the need for drastic weight cuts, so that wrestlers may compete closer to their natural weight. UWW president Nenad Lalovic had said at the time, \"I [..] believe these new rules will also encourage healthier wrestlers.\"\n\nThe logic was that dividing it over two days meant that athletes wouldn't lose a huge amount of weight in one day and compete, but an important part of that was the 2kg allowance on the second day. If the concept of the daily weigh-in can't be dropped (even boxing has daily weigh-ins on the morning of the bouts), revisiting the original 2017 format would be a start.\n\nStrangely, while dropping the 2kg provision from the Olympics (without any explanation), the UWW itself follows this rule in certain \"international tournaments\" like the World Cup. Why not extend it to the Olympic Games? Whatever the reasoning behind allowing this tolerance at other events, surely that could be extended to the single most important tournament in the sport.\n\nStaggered weigh-ins for different wrestlers\n\nAt the Olympics, each wrestler must make weight ahead of the morning session. While this makes sense for those competing in that session, for finalists who only compete late in the evening session (such as in Vinesh's case), why can't there be an afternoon weigh-in? Considering how little effort it requires from the administrator's side and how big an impact it could make on the athlete's health and physical condition, this could be a provision that's explored.\n\nExplained: Why was Vinesh Phogat disqualified from Paris Olympics?\n\nSeemingly, all the weigh-ins are done at the same point since UWW referees and officials need to be present at the time of the weigh-in. Surely, though, the global body can manage to conduct an additional, smaller-scale weigh-in in the afternoon for finalists who compete later. That would give the wrestlers, who have put on weight after the Day 1 weigh-in thanks to rehydration and nutrition, sufficient time to lose weight. In Vinesh's case, specifically, she would most likely have shed the excess 100 grams of weight and been cleared for her final.\n\nCater to the biological differences between women and men\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association (IOA) tried to argue that \"the biological difference in the bodies of male and female wrestlers, particularly in light of the menstruation of women, needs to be taken into account whilst determining the eligibility of female wrestlers on the second day of the weigh-in\".\n\nBennett dismissed the IOA's argument, stating that it was \"unquantified\", and that \"the effects of any such differences [between male and female bodies], and of steps to mitigate such effects, are speculative and unsupported by evidence and cannot be considered for the purposes of this Application.\" This is a reasonable statement.\n\nWhy not quantify it, though? Why not have supportive evidence to back the anecdotal? To do this would take very specific studies to be conducted on women's physiology (as against generalising based on men's), for each Olympic weight class. Such a scientific approach would only help the athletes -- which should be the prime consideration of the governing body.\n\nVinesh Phogat has a bigger fight, if she wants it: saving Indian wrestling\n\nSports science has progressed over the years, and an in-depth study of many aspects unique to female physiology -- like how menstrual cycles affect weight retention -- can be commissioned.\n\nFor instance, multiple focused studies have shown how women footballers are more prone to ACL injuries (4-6 times more) due to various factors, all of which can be quantified: ligamentous laxity, hormonal influences, neuromuscular imbalances, biomechanical alignment, and intercondylar notch width. The study of this has helped advocate for different training methodologies for women - like managing the greater imbalance between hamstring and quadricep strength. It's also helping in the design of boots specific to women footballers (wider around the toes, narrower at the heel and more support around the arch).\n\nThere are visible changes in the way sport is played too - the three-point line in the WNBA is 20'6\" from the basket, in the NBA it is 23'9\", and they use different-sized balls (size 6 vs size 7). In Olympic track and field, the men's shotput is 7.26 kg, the women's is 4 kg, the women's hurdle is 2'9\" high, while the men's is 3'6\". A volleyball net is at 2.43m for men and 2.24m for women.\n\nThese sweeping differences, though, are not necessary for wrestling as it stands. What we are calling for here is to adopt a more scientific approach -- like football is starting to adopt -- to take a relook at certain rules and regulations that clearly were designed for men (look at the looseness of language in the regulations, where the pronoun 'he' is often used by itself) and rework those for women.\n\nIs the 'punishment' proportional?\n\n\"The Sole Arbitrator observes that the Athlete entered the field of play and fought and won three rounds and reached the final of the 50 kg wrestling competition at the Paris Olympic Games before she failed the second weigh-in and was ineligible to compete in the final. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on her part.\"\n\nNo wrongdoing. And yet, a finalist of the Games walks away without a medal. There is an inherent injustice here that UWW can ensure won't happen in the future -- the striking down of the \"draconian\" rule that states failing of the second weigh-in disqualifies the athlete from the entire competition. In Vinesh's case, she was below the 50kg limit on day 1, and she pulled off three remarkable wins on that day -- surely, it's reasonable to suggest that we consider that for the final result? Don't let the athlete compete on day 2 if they don't make weight, but don't erase day 1's triumphs either.\n\nBefore Vinesh Phogat the icon was Vinesh Phogat the champion wrestler\n\nLet's continue with the Vinesh example -- if we are voiding her results from day 1, couldn't the great Yui Susaki claim on good grounds that she's as entitled to advance to the gold medal match as the wrestler who was promoted to it, Yusneylis Guzman Lopez? Having come into the Games with an 82-0 record in international competition, it stands to reason that she would have been the favourite to advance if she'd been given a chance to take on Lopez (like she showed by beating Vinesh's quarterfinal opponent Oksana Livach in repechage). If Vinesh is ranked last, with no wins, Susaki has a logical claim for a route to the final as well.\n\nParis' boxing unit regulations, for instance, state that: \"If a Boxer fails the Medical Examination or Daily Weigh-In, his/her opponent will win by WO,\" but there is no mention of taking a medal away from them (in boxing, entering semifinals guarantees a medal). It stands to reason from the reading of the rules that a boxer who didn't make the daily weigh-in ahead of the final would forfeit the final by walkover, but still be awarded a silver medal.\n\nNow, implementing changes as suggested in the previous points may take time, but in the meantime, this is one disproportionate punishment that can be removed with a simple press of the backspace key.\n\nThe Vinesh Phogat case is a unique one, and while retrospectively addressing it may well be impossible, it can be used as the springboard for change.",

But \"I've studied the whole show,\" he says, and it's clear to Embiid that Kit Harington's character, Jon Snow, will not end up on the Iron Throne.\n\n\"That's what everybody thinks is going to happen,\" Embiid says. \"But the whole show has been that you don't know what's going to happen. Jon Snow will not be the king.\"\n\nWe've been in a car together for about 30 minutes, driving from San Francisco to Sacramento, where the 76ers' irrepressible young star will meet his teammates for a game the next night. Already Embiid has made predictions about Game of Thrones, this year's NBA Finals-- \"[The Warriors] will be ready to go seven games with the Sixers in June!\"-- and how his own ride on the fame cycle might turn.\n\n\"People love you at the beginning,\" Embiid explains. \"But at some point they're gonna start hating you. LeBron. Russell Westbrook. All the superstars. Even Steph. He's so likable. He does nothing wrong, but some people still hate him. It just comes with the nature of it. I've seen it.\n\n\"I feel like I'm about to go through it. I think it's coming. People always want something new.\"\n\nTo be clear, no one appears anywhere close to turning on Embiid. After four years of former general manager Sam Hinkie's YOLO tanking in pursuit of future greatness, the Sixers have come to life in the first part of this NBA season, with Embiid as their trash-talking, Dream Shaking leader. Social media adores his blend of right-up-to-the-line trolling and self-deprecating humor. NBA coaches and veterans marvel at his unique skill set-- low-post dominance like Shaquille O'Neal, footwork like Hakeem Olajuwon, a shooting touch like Dirk Nowitzki. \"He's a problem,\" Lakers coach Luke Walton said on Nov. 15, after Embiid torched his team for 46 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists and 7 blocks. Even the hardened, cynical fans in Philadelphia seem smitten with Embiid.\n\nThe Process, the nickname Embiid gave himself last year as an homage to the Hinkie era, has become a civic rallying cry. It can be heard at road games in Boston and Washington, D.C. A viral video featured a Lyft driver who shouted it as he followed Embiid on a Rocky Balboa-style run through the streets of Philadelphia one night.\n\nEmbiid loves it. When Sixers fans chant it as he shoots free throws, he'll wave his arms, imploring them to chant louder.\n\n\"It's like Happy Gilmore out there,\" former teammate Nik Stauskas says. \"Most people like the place to be quiet when they're shooting. Jo's like, 'Come on, man, make some noise!'\"\n\nAnd if they don't, he's not happy about it.\n\n\"Oh, he eggs the crowd on,\" Sixers swingman Robert Covington says. \"He loves it.\"\n\nAll in all, it's clear that Philly-- not to mention NBA Twitter-- is still firmly in the honeymoon phase with its young star. So why does he think the world might be about to turn on him?\n\nIs that what he's afraid of?\n\nOr what he wants?\n\nTo understand Embiid, you must first understand the psychology of the troll. As anyone who has ever checked his Twitter mentions knows, there are all sorts of trolls. Mean ones, funny ones, bullies, racists, pranksters. They all have the same goal: to get a reaction.\n\nEmbiid is a playful troll.\n\n\"I don't go over the line, but I feel like I'm always right there,\" he says with a grin. Of course he is aware it makes people within the organization crazy that their budding superstar keeps giving shoutouts to the deposed general manager who led the franchise to one of the worst stretches in NBA history. That's kind of the point.\n\n\"I won't mention names, but a lot of people weren't happy\" with his call-outs, Embiid says. \"I don't care. To me it was like, we've gone through so much, and I get that Sam Hinkie wasn't the most loved in Philly, but that was the guy who drafted me. I still like him. He did a lot for me.\"\n\nSo he calls himself The Process, over and over, mischievously defusing its bite with humor and hashtags but still cutting right up close to the quick.\n\n\"I'm not doing it to hurt anybody's feelings or create a situation,\" Embiid says. \"I just think it's funny.\"\n\nThis is the essence of Embiid. Always flexing. Kidding but not kidding. Trolling on social media, trash-talking on the court, playfully tweaking people to see what they'll do about it. But Embiid is pushing himself as much as he's pushing buttons.\n\n\"I love that stuff. That gets me going,\" he says. \"That makes me want to score and block a shot and dive on the floor. That makes me want to make a great play. I hate when we go on the road and other teams don't really have fans who cheer. ... I feel like it makes me sleepy.\n\n\"I want to get into the fans, I want to hear their voices and hear people talking s--- and hear people get into the game crazy and chanting 'Ref sucks' or 'Trust the process' or 'Joel, you suck!'\"\n\nSo he likes the pressure it puts on him?\n\n\"I love the pressure.\"\n\nThis fall, the Sixers gave Embiid a five-year, $146.5 million contract extension after seeing him play just 31 games in his first three seasons. They saw enough talent, star power and character to believe he can be the face of their franchise for a long time.\n\nBut Embiid has felt like the star of this team for far longer than he's been paid like one. Back in May 2015, Embiid spent the better part of a week destroying people in three-on-three games at the 76ers' practice facility. Young players, veterans, the wayward coach who jumped into one of the games to get a closer look: Nobody could stop Embiid, including Nerlens Noel, whom the Sixers had picked sixth overall in 2013 and had high hopes for.\n\n\"I played against him,\" Embiid says. \"And actually, I killed it.\"\n\nAfter sitting out his entire rookie season with a foot injury in 2014-15, Embiid was finally back on the court, and he looked like some mythological creature sent to destroy opponents and resurrect a basketball franchise. It didn't take long for word to reach Hinkie, who was off scouting in California.\n\nHinkie texted Covington, wanting to make sure this was real and not just sycophants trying to make him feel better about using a lottery pick on an injured big man.\n\n\"[Embiid] literally almost ran all our bigs out of the gym,\" Covington says. \"It was the first time I'd seen him, and for him to dominate like that, it was like, 'Well, damn.'\"\n\nA few weeks later, Embiid started playing against veterans at pickup games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It was a joke how good he was,\" veteran NBA guard Jamal Crawford says. \"I saw then that the league had nothing for him.\"\n\nLess than a week later, an MRI revealed that the bone in Embiid's foot wasn't healing properly. Today, the foot, knee and back injuries that derailed Embiid's first three seasons are as much a part of his story as his incredible journey from Cameroon to NBA stardom. His health is the giant blinking asterisk affixed to every prediction about his destiny and the great expectations for the Sixers' future.\n\nHe was the first rookie to average at least 28.7 points per 36 minutes played since Wilt Chamberlain. With Embiid and rookie point guard Ben Simmons on the court, the Sixers, through Dec. 11, had outscored teams by 9.9 points per 100 possessions-- a net rating behind only the Warriors and Rockets.\n\nEmbiid's health hangs over all of these dreams.\n\nHe and the team are proactive: Embiid has gone to Aspetar, a state-of-the-art sports medicine facility in Qatar, where experts study everything from his sleep patterns to his gait, trying to build his body in the most sustainable way possible. During interviews at his locker, a world-renowned physiotherapist digs into the quadriceps muscle above his knee. He used to love rich, buttery French food but gave up dairy because it causes too much inflammation. He sits out the second night of back-to-backs on orders from the front office.\n\nEmbiid stopped trying to fight these modifications a long time ago. His protests about sitting out feel more spiritual than philosophical.\n\n\"I'm not OK with it,\" he says. \"But it's best for the future. They know that once I'm on the court, if you let me stay on the court, I'm going to lead.\"\n\nEmbiid was a teenager in Cameroon when he first saw Kobe Bryant in all his swaggering, gunslinging glory during the 2009 NBA Finals. Embiid didn't speak English and had never played organized basketball, yet he knew he wanted to be like Kobe someday.\n\n\"I just liked his mentality, the way he was playing. He just didn't care,\" Embiid says. \"I think I needed to figure out a way to be like that more.\"\n\nIn another life-- or another body-- Embiid would probably be out running sand dunes like Bryant did at 4 a.m. as a way of channeling the restless id inside him. But Embiid's body would never tolerate that, so the competitiveness manifests elsewhere. It's why he trash-talks and taunts on the court right up to the line where someone might swing at him. Why he plays video games deep into the night, even bringing his PlayStation on road trips. \"I just love winning,\" he says. \"When I play, I rarely lose, so it makes me feel good about myself. And I keep winning, winning, winning.\"\n\n\"I played [PlayStation] with him once and said I'll never do it again,\" Sixers guard T.J. McConnell says. \"He talks the most crap ever. ... I wanted to throw the controller out of his apartment building.\"\n\nEmbiid says he's reached out to Bryant on several occasions, drawn to Kobe's supreme confidence. How do you shoot 30-plus times in a game and never feel even the smallest twinge of guilt about it?\n\n\"After 15 to 20 shots, I feel like my teammates might be looking at me,\" Embiid says. \"I don't want that to be on me. But I feel like sometimes I need to.\"\n\nBryant didn't take all those shots because he had no conscience. He took them, Embiid says, because he knew he could make them. \"He was always working on his shot, so that's why he felt like he could.\n\n\"When everyone else was partying, he was working on his shot. I have to get a little of that.\"\n\nSo Embiid doesn't drink alcohol or spend much time at parties. He studies classic NBA games like they're textbooks. He watches his contemporaries, like Karl-Anthony Towns, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kristaps Porzingis, Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic, knowing he'll likely do battle with them in the playoffs someday.\n\nHe studies his own team and thinks there is still room to grow. Simmons' game is limited by his lack of outside shooting, which collapses the space Embiid has to work inside. There will also be an adjustment period when rookie point guard Markelle Fultz returns from a shoulder injury and tries to find his place in the offense.\n\n\"We're still working on our chemistry, especially with me and Ben on the court,\" Embiid says.\n\n\"I think with everything, the main thing we have to do is just stay together, because I feel like there's going to be some type of situation where people say who is better between us three. And that's how it splits.\"\n\nIT IS NOW Embiid's job to ensure that it doesn't. That's part of accepting the $146.5 million contract and wanting to be the face of the franchise. You have a responsibility to lead it.\n\nIn many ways, the 23-year-old is a natural-born leader. His infectious personality is like a gravitational force. Teammates flock to him after games and on off-days. But if Embiid is the sun at the center of the Sixers' solar system, Simmons is the moon. The young Australian mostly keeps to himself and has a natural quietness to him.\n\n\"Night and day,\" Sixers wing Justin Anderson says of his teammates' personalities.\n\n\u0093I don't go over the line, but I feel like I'm always right there.\u0094\n\n- Joel Embiid\n\nFor Embiid to take this team to its full potential, he has to do it with Simmons, which means they need to foster a relationship that has at times been distant.\n\n\"They have a role to play in each other's success,\" coach Brett Brown says. \"What interests me more than going out to dinner or being together off the court all the time is respect on the court. And the respect is generated because you look at somebody and know they care, know they work, know the team is in their best interest.\"\n\nBrown spent 12 years working under Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, and he says it took years for Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker, the core of the Spurs dynasty, to find out how to play-- and win-- together. Popovich was always the strongest voice in the room, Duncan led by example, Parker was the beating heart, Ginobili was the conscience. Brown says he used to get emails from Duncan at all hours of the night, musing on how to address an issue the team needed to work on.\n\n\"Everybody's got their own way to deliver a message,\" Brown says. \"To try to force a style of leadership on anybody is not what I'm interested in.\"\n\nOf course, Embiid's style of leadership isn't always the most politically correct.\n\n\"Having your teammates' backs-- that's what I feel being a leader is,\" Embiid says.\n\nThis year that's meant Brown and the Sixers have to bite their tongues when Embiid criticizes the way they've handled situations with Fultz, whose mysterious shoulder injury has kept him from any meaningful action, and former lottery pick Jahlil Okafor, who was finally traded to the Nets on Dec. 7, more than a month after requesting to leave.\n\n\"The whole thing with Markelle is messed up,\" Embiid says. \"It should not have happened. Obviously, it has something to do with his shoulder-- I saw that they said it wasn't the shoulder, but I don't believe it.\n\n\"With Jahlil, I really appreciate that he didn't want to cause a scene,\" he says. \"If it was me, I feel like I would have lost it. I don't know if I could have handled it.\"\n\nEmbiid makes headlines and ruffles feathers when he talks like this. Same as he did when he co-opted \"The Process\" as his nickname. Teammates mostly are amused by it. \"He loves to poke the bear-- he thrives on it,\" Stauskas says. \"I've never really seen anything like it. It's different, but it works.\"\n\nIn the end, trusting the process really means trusting Embiid.\n\n\"We encourage him to explore and be a little bit unfiltered,\" Brown says with a smile. \"That's how he lives. And that's how he plays.\"\n\nEMBIID HAS DONE so much in his young career-- through 50 games, he scored more points than Olajuwon, grabbed more rebounds than Patrick Ewing, had more assists and 3-pointers than Olajuwon, Ewing, O'Neal, Dwight Howard and David Robinson-- that it's easy to forget how quickly this has all happened.\n\nSeven years ago, the man didn't speak English, let alone play basketball, and now he's wickedly funny in another language and one of the most skilled big men in the sport. He jokes that he learned English by listening to rap music and how to shoot by \"watching [videos] of white people.\" But clearly there's more to it.\n\nMore From Doubletruck\n\nDoubletruck is the home for ESPN storytelling, a place to find great features, investigations and character portraits. Doubletruck home \u00bb\n\n\"I look like I'm not listening, but I'm actually listening,\" Embiid explains. \"I like listening to everything, observing everybody, just taking everything in and then in my mind, figuring out what's good for me and what's bad for me.\"\n\nSo far he's figured it out pretty well. For every testy Twitter exchange that goes right up to the line, Embiid does 10 more playful, irreverent things that seem solely motivated by a boyish sense of adventure.\n\nHe's out shagging fly balls during the Home Run Derby at the MLB All-Star Game. He's at the World Series, tweeting \"Let's Go Astros!\" while wearing a Dodgers jersey. He's playing tennis on a public court at night with strangers who challenge him to a game.\n\nOn the one hand, Embiid is an anthropologist, using what is obviously a brilliant mind to study our culture with fresh eyes. On the other, he's Tom Hanks in the movie Big, testing out games meant for children while in the body of a man.\n\nBefore the NBA draft, his first agent, Arn Tellem, hired a social media coach for Embiid. At first, Embiid followed his instructions to post unassuming, sports-focused updates. \"But unfortunately I got hurt and I didn't have anything to do,\" Embiid says. \"I found social media was a way for me to open up and show the world who I was and also keep my name out there.\"\n\nPretty soon he was asking Rihanna out on a date and recruiting LeBron James via Twitter.\n\n\"On social media, I can hide behind the computer or the iPhone,\" Embiid says. \"Internet courage.\"\n\nThere's the playful troll again. The kidding-not-kidding wink that masks why Embiid likes to play so close to the fire.\n\nHe doesn't want to get burned. He just needs to feel the heat. All this trolling, this button-pushing, it's just a warm-up-- his way of summoning the greatness to back it up.\n\nRamona ShelburneShelburne is a senior writer for ESPN.

The decision comes a day after the ad-hoc division of the CAS said it needed three more days (until August 16, 9:30pm IST) to announce its final verdict.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS\n\n\"The Ad-Hoc division of the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) renders the following decision: The application filed by Vinesh Phogat on 7th August, 2024 is dismissed,\" the CAS order read.\n\nIn a statement, IOA President PT Usha expressed \"shock and disappointment at the decision of the Sole Arbitrator at the CAS to dismiss wrestler Vinesh Phogat's application against the United World Wrestling (UWW) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\"\n\n\"The operative part of the August 14 decision, which dismisses Vinesh's application to be awarded a shared silver medal in women's 50 kg category at the Paris Olympic Games has significant implications for her in particular and the sporting community at large,\" the IOA stated.\n\n. The IOA said it will continue to explore legal options but at this point, the matter seems closed. \"The operative part of the August 14 decision, which dismisses Vinesh's application to be awarded a shared silver medal in women's 50 kg category at the Paris Olympic Games has significant implications for her in particular and the sporting community at large,\" the IOA stated.\n\n\"IOA continues to stand in full support of Ms. Phogat and is exploring further legal options. The IOA is committed to ensuring that Vinesh's case is heard,\" it added.\n\nVinesh was disqualified on August 7, when she was 100 grams above the weight limit of 50kgs. She had weighed in at 49.9kg on the morning of her first bout and went on to reach the final after three bouts but weighed 52.7kg by the end of day's play.\n\nAfter a sleepless night where drastic measures were taken to make weight, Vinesh weighed in at 50.1kg on the morning of her gold medal bout and was subsequently disqualified as per UWW (United World Wrestling) rules, which states that an athlete who doesn't make the weight cut will be eliminated from the competition.\n\nExplained: Why was Vinesh Phogat disqualified from Paris Olympics? How does wrestling weigh-in work?\n\nFollowing Vinesh's disqualification, Yusneylys Guzman Lopez of Cuba (whom Vinesh had defeated in her semifinal) replaced her in the gold medal bout, which was won by Sarah Hildebrandt of the USA.\n\nVinesh had appealed to the CAS late on August 7 over her disqualification and the CAS accepted her appeal before referring the case to Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett AC SC, sitting as a Sole Arbitrator.\n\nVinesh was represented by a group of pro bono French lawyers who are part of a panel set up for the Olympics to fight urgent cases that come before CAS. The IOA, which is an interested party in the case, was represented by Harish Salve and Vidushpat Singhania. Vinesh subsequently announced her retirement from wrestling on August 8, saying she had no strength left to continue.\n\nThe Sole Arbitrator held a hearing with the parties on August 8 and a verdict was to be announced before the Games ended. However, a statement from the IOA said the verdict would be announced on August 9, which it rectified later by saying that the deadline was for the parties to submit additional documents and that the final verdict would only be known only on Tuesday.\n\nThe grounds for appeal by Vinesh's team are understood to rest on these points: she won three bouts on August 6 with her weight within the limit, and therefore her entry to the final was legal. After those three bouts she needed to hydrate and eat to a sufficient quantity for her body to recover, so the weight she regained was not in the nature of giving her an advantage but part of an essential recovery process.",

    "raw_text": "The Pro Kabaddi League has been around for a decade now. Ten seasons, over 1000 matches. And in all these seasons over the last decade, there simply has never been a team as dominant as the current Puneri Paltan squad. They decimated every opposition they came up against, lost just two in 24 games and deservedly won the PKL 10 title in their second successive final.\n\nThe stats tell you the story:\n\n\u2022 They finished with a score difference of 272: the best in PKL history\n\n\u2022 Most successful campaign in PKL ever, losing just 2/24 matches\n\n\u2022 Most tackle points in PKL 10 [349] at a league-high average of 14.54 tackle points per game\n\n\u2022 Scored 950 points this season: third-best in PKL history\n\n\u2022 Conceded the lowest points [678] and least All Outs in six seasons [14]\n\n\u2022 Coach BC Ramesh is the first to win the title with three different teams [Bengaluru Bulls (as assistant), Bengal Warriors and Puneri Paltan]\n\n\u2022 PKL 10's MVP and best defender are from Puneri Paltan\n\nAll for one, one for all\n\nFrom the very first game to Friday's final, Puneri Paltan have shown time and again just how lethal they are. And it's not that they do anything extraordinary or fancy. It's just that each player does his task swimmingly well and if someone's having a bad day, the others cover up for him. That's simply it. No gimmicks.\n\nEach of their players added an extra element to their skillset: for example, raiders Mohit Goyat and Pankaj Mohite ramped up their defensive skills while left-corner defender Mohammadreza Shadloui gave glimpses of his raiding prowess. They played as a team from start to finish, each of them playing for the logo on their chest and not chasing individual milestones. Here's a stat to support that: among all the 12 teams, Puneri Paltan scored 464 raid points this season, but all three of their main raiders have a total of eight Super 10s. For context, Arjun Deshwal has 17.\n\nThat sums up the fact that all this Puneri Paltan unit wants is the win for the team, the individual stats just don't matter.\n\nCaptain Aslam, a humble leader\n\nAslam Inamdar is one of the youngest captains in PKL. He succeeded PKL's most successful captain ever, Fazel Atrachali, when he was handed the reins of this team. Mind you, Aslam was coming off the Asian Games gold medal triumph and could have very well felt he was a tad more accomplished than his teammates.\n\nBut there was none of that. Aslam. Despite being a raider himself, he didn't hesitate to send Mohit or Pankaj to do the bulk of the raiding. He doubled up as a defender when the situation demanded it and he fit into any role the team needed him to play in.\n\nThe fact that nearly all the players are in their early 20s could've been a little tricky for Aslam, but he handled it with finesse and it also helped as there was never a chance for anyone to play the \"seniority\" card or for egos to clash.\n\nClever squad building\n\nWe'd written on these pages earlier about how Puneri Paltan had won the auction even before they were held by retaining the core of their team. Six out of their starting seven players were retained from last season. They let go of the Iranian duo of Fazel and Mohammad Esmaeil Nabibakhsh and replaced him with Shadloui. Who, to be fair, had a much bigger impact than the outgoing pair.\n\nThe fact that Puneri Paltan retained Aslam, Mohit and Pankaj as New Young Players is an absolute cheat code, something that the team can continue to exploit for a couple more years. They will all but hold on to this squad for next season too, giving them an edge even before the season kicks off.\n\nGrassroots to champions\n\nThe prime reason why Puneri Paltan have such an incredible young squad is courtesy of their Investment in a youth team. The Yuva Paltan is home to Puneri Paltan's next-gen squad and gives them a realistic shot at playing for the main team. Ask Aslam, Mohit or even the two Shindes - Akash and Aditya - they've all come through the academy. Credit also has to go to former India captain and Puneri Paltan coach Anup Kumar, who took a punt on the youngsters in season 8.\n\nSpeaking to ESPN earlier, Puneri Paltan's CEO, Kailash Kandpal, said the club decided to invest in a feeder system since they noticed a \"shortage of players in the pipeline\"\n\n\"So, we decided to develop talent from the grassroots and get a new supply of players for our team's sustenance. We have players from across the length and breadth of the country. It's not that we only have players from Maharashtra because we're Puneri Paltan, we have boys from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Haryana and Punjab as well. And we have shown them that there is something for all of them here, they can make it to the A team if they do well.\"\n\nA lot of Puneri Paltan's players have also come through the Air India team, coached by Asian Games gold medallist and Arjuna awardee Ashok Shinde. He was a former Puneri Paltan coach and continues to unearth talent for the team. Aslam paid homage to Shinde after the title win by saying \"We have won this title for you.\"\n\nVictory through diversity\n\nPuneri Paltan have one of the most diverse squads in PKL and that has worked in their favour. Coach Ramesh is from Karnataka, captain Aslam is from Maharashtra, Mohit is from Haryana, their second-best defender Gaurav Khatri is Punjabi, defender Abinesh Nadarajan is from Tamil Nadu while Shadloui is from Iran. They have the best from each corner of the country, as opposed to many other teams, whose talent is largely limited to Haryana.\n\nThe diversity not only gives the coach more options but also leads to culture exchange, which in turn paves the way for more holistic player development. The management has also taken the extra effort to enhance team bonding - whether it was a visit to the coastal town of Mahabalipuram during the Chennai leg, or a poolside barbecue in Bangalore or a visit to the many forts in Jaipur. The result of that is to be seen: a champion team, where each player uplifts the other, all in their quest to have that star above their crest.",

    "raw_text": "Lakshya Sen faced his first loss of the Paris Olympics, going down to the reigning Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen in the men's singles semifinal. The unseeded Indian had three game points in the first game and led the second 7-0, but the world no. 2 raised his level at the crucial moments to win 22-20, 21-14.\n\nAUGUST 4: LIVE UPDATES | INDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nBut this loss doesn't mean the end of Lakshya's record-breaking campaign. The 22-year-old Indian can still win a medal when he plays Malaysia's 26-year-old Lee Zii Jia, who is the seventh seed, for the bronze.\n\nThe match will be on Monday evening at 6 PM.\n\nINDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS 2024 - AUGUST 5 FULL SCHEDULE\n\nWhat are Lakshya's chances against Lee?\n\nSimply put, Lakshya has a great chance to win the bronze based on form guide and track record. He has a superior 4-1 record against the Malaysian on the BWF Tour.\n\nIn fact, Lakshya won his first major senior title back in 2016 -- India International Series -- beating Lee in the final. Yes, their history goes that far back. He has since beaten Lee in every individual competition they have played, the only loss coming at the 2022 Thomas Cup in the quarterfinals (a tournament India went on to win.)\n\nAnd most of Lakshya's wins have come in the biggest tournaments. He stunned Lee, who was the defending champion, at the 2022 All England Championships, where Lakshya reached the final. He also beat Lee in the first round of the 2023 Indonesia Open Super 1000, after which Lee took a break from badminton for a while.\n\nThe bronze medal match will undoubtedly be the biggest and Lee's motivation will be higher after a semifinal loss. But Lakshya has the ability to raise his game in such moments and against a player he has regularly beaten, he will fancy his chances.\n\nWhat are Lee's strengths?\n\nLee is a top player, regularly seeded and has won big titles. But he is also a mercurial player, whose levels fall and dip, sometimes in between the same match.\n\nHe has an attacking style, and his explosive strokeplay can match the best. He also has the physicality needed for the long haul. What he lacks is consistency. His natural style lends to a bunch of unforced errors and in the last few years he has lost some of the force in the smashes.\n\nHe's looking to change his erratic way though and has spoken about how he's working to find some balance between his highs and lows this year. He is moving towards a more control-based game now, where the difference between his best and his average level is not so big. But under pressure, his natural game veers towards aggression.\n\nHow can Lakshya nullify those strengths?\n\nLakshya's biggest strength -- his stunning defence -- will be his biggest weapon against Lee. He is one of the fastest young players on court and can retrieve from virtually any corner and be ready for the next shot. This counterpunching, coupled with his quick reflexes, can frustrate aggressive players like Lee into making mistakes.\n\nIn the last few months, Lakshya has been adding to his natural game by way of sharpness at the net and an attacking strokeplay, which we have been seeing more and more in Paris. This variation can unsettle the momentum like it did against top players Jonatan Christie and Chou Tien Chen (and resulted in the big lead against Axelsen). This could be a crucial ploy against Lee too, who is a rhythm player of sorts.\n\nLakshya also has big belief against top players, which is that young Indian athlete quality we see on the rise. As his coach Vimal Kumar said, he is a big-match player who has beaten most of the top 20 which gives him great confidence heading into a big match.\n\nWhat Lakshya needs to be careful of?\n\nThe one thing that could derail Lakshya would be nervy errors in the big points. Like in the three game points against Axelsen. He has to quickly regroup after the loss and learn from it to avoid making mistakes and keep his advantage.\n\nHe has played more matches than any of the other players in the top four by virtue of being in a group of four and not getting a quarterfinal bye. But he is in great physical shape and has played himself well into the courts.\n\nIf he can channel the confidence as he did against Christie and the quality against Chou, an Olympic bronze medal is within touching distance. It will be the first for an Indian man at the Olympics.",

    "raw_text": "Vinesh Phogat, who announced her retirement from wrestling, has earned a reputation that places her above and beyond her sport - the events of the past 18 months have cemented her legacy as an icon of her times.\n\nBut it's important to remember that before all that, she was one of India's best ever wrestlers. Fast, unpredictable, intelligent, she was a scholar of the sport who could think on her feet, quite literally. Her three bouts in one day at the Paris Olympics demonstrated her tactical nous - she had different strategies for each opponent, winning all the bouts comprehensively.\n\nWhile many of the tributes today focus on her fight outside the mat, one of the best comments about Vinesh the wrestler came in 2019 from Sarah Hilderbrandt, her would-be opponent in the Olympics final till she was disqualified (Hilderbrandt eventually won the gold medal). \"I have never practiced these crazy situations that Vinesh puts you in,\" Hildebrandt said after losing to Vinesh at the 2019 World Championships. \"She is very unorthodox and I am unable to finish against her. She improvises so much that it makes it difficult.\"\n\nThat was the New, Improved Vinesh Hildebrandt was fighting against. Until 2018, Vinesh only knew the attack mode. No matter the opposition, no matter whether she was trailing or leading the bout, she would attack.\n\nThat changed when she teamed up with Hungarian coach Woller Akos. She then started doing something she'd once considered a weakness: study her opponents and attack with restraint. It brought out the best in her and two World Championship medals followed.\n\nTake the 2018 Asian Games final against Japan's Yuki Irie. The Japanese had won 20 of her last 21 bouts - her sole loss was against Vinesh. Irie knew what to expect - or so she thought. Vinesh typically would lead with her right leg, which was also one of her weaknesses as she would get caught out by pedigree wrestlers. So she switched it up - led with her left leg instead and that stumped Irie, who struggled to find answers as she had trained to go after the right leg.\n\nThis simple but effective tactical change helped Vinesh become the first Indian woman wrestler to win an Asian Games gold. And it gave other Indian wrestlers hope that an Indian could beat wrestlers from Japan, the powerhouse of women's wrestling.\n\nIt was this ability to tweak her approach and improvise that made her the #1 ranked wrestler in the 53kg division and the top seed at the Tokyo Games. That 2019 bout against Hildebrandt earned her the quota for the Tokyo Olympics. Hildebrandt, the reigning world #1, was the obvious favourite as Vinesh was still relatively new in the 53kg category. The American did what she knew best: attack Vinesh's right leg. She grabbed the right leg five times in the six minutes, but not once did Vinesh let her score a point. \"She's wearing you out!\" screamed the American's coach and Vinesh was doing just that in the 8-2 win.\n\nIt was an on-the-spot change that made the difference. Akos had told Vinesh to stay away from Hildebrandt and not let her attack her legs, but Vinesh did the exact opposite. She let Hildebrandt come in for the takedowns, countered them and tired her out.\n\nThat change in strategy won her the World Championships bronze medal and also convinced her that she had what it took to fight in the 53kg division.\n\nHer bouts in Paris are now the stuff of legend. Especially against the unbeatable Yui Susaki. Vinesh's strategy stunned the wrestling world: she held off Susaki for five minutes and 45 seconds before swooping in for the kill with 15 seconds left. It's hard to imagine many other wrestlers taking that sort of risk in such a high-profile bout against a wrestler of that calibre.\n\nLess than an hour later, she returned to her vintage attacking self against Oksana Livach to move into the semifinal. What followed, against Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, was a combination of the two.\n\nThat's what made her such a formidable opponent: you never knew which version of Vinesh you will face.\n\nWould it be the aggressive Vinesh? In your face, crouching low and maintaining eye-level contact. Almost as if looking into your mind, pre-empting your next move. Before you know it, seeing the tiniest sliver of an opening and swooping in in a flash to sweep you off your feet and slam you on the mat.\n\nOr the defensive Vinesh? Holding you back and wrangling for 90% of the bout before switching gears into attack mode.\n\nOr the Vinesh that could do both with equal finesse? Stay firm enough on her feet to not give you any scoring chances, but at the same time stay on her toes to pounce at you when there's an opening. She kept you guessing. But here's the catch - she never second-guessed herself: she knew exactly what she wanted and got it done. As she did in life, both on and off the mat.",

Well, we will need to wait another three days to find out.\n\nThe ad-hoc division of the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS), which was to announce its final verdict on August 13, has sought a further extension of three days. The final decision will be announced on August 16 at 9:30pm IST.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS\n\nHere's the complete timeline of the last week in Vinesh's life, where she produced her career's best wrestling and is now wrestling against her disqualification -\n\nAugust 6: Vinesh has the toughest possible draw: an opening-round bout against top seed and world #1 Yui Susaki - but she beats Susaki, the first defeat for the Japanese in her international career. Vinesh then beats two-time European Games medallist Oksana Livach and Pan-American Games champion Yusneylys Guzman Lopez to become the first Indian woman wrestler to reach an Olympic final. Later that evening, Vinesh was back to training as she needed to cut around 2kgs before the next morning.\n\nHow Vinesh Phogat won the Olympic medal: Fought with heart, thought with head\n\nAugust 7: Vinesh is up all night and takes drastic measures, including cutting her hair, but it's not enough in the end - she fails the weigh-in by 100 grams and is disqualified from the competition. It meant she would not be eligible for the silver medal despite making the final and she would be ranked last among the 16 competitors.\n\nLate in the day, Vinesh appeals to the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS) and seeks to be awarded a joint-silver medal. CAS asks till Thursday morning to reply to the appeal.\n\nExplained: Why was Vinesh Phogat disqualified from the Paris Olympics?\n\nAugust 8: At 5:17am IST, Vinesh announces her retirement from the sport. In a heartfelt social media post, Vinesh writes that she has no strength left to continue. The CAS accepts Vinesh's appeal and the matter is referred to the Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett AC SC, sitting as a Sole Arbitrator, who holds a hearing with the parties that day. The CAS' statement says a final decision is expected to be issued before the end of the Games. Former Solicitor General of India, Harish Salve, is roped in to represent the IOA at the hearing.\n\nBefore Vinesh Phogat the icon was Vinesh Phogat the champion wrestler\n\nAugust 9: The hearing into Vinesh's appeal concludes at the ad-hoc division of the CAS. Vinesh is represented by a group of pro bono French lawyers who are part of a panel set up for the Olympics to fight urgent cases that come before CAS. The IOA, which is an interested party in the case, is represented by Harish Salve and Vidushpat Singhania. The IOA said it \"remained hopeful of a positive resolution.\"\n\nAugust 10: A statement from the IOA says the verdict will be announced on August 11, but in a chaotic turn of events, it later issues a correction that that the deadline was for the parties to submit additional documents and that the final verdict would only be known only on August 13.\n\n\"The ad-hoc division of CAS has extended time for the Sole Arbitrator Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett in the Vinesh Phogat vs. United World Wrestling & the International Olympic Committee matter to give a decision till 6-00 p.m. on August 13, 2024,\" a statement from the IOA read.\n\nVinesh Phogat retires: a list of all accolades won by an Indian wrestling great\n\nAugust 13: The CAS' ad-hoc division says it will need another three days to announce a final verdict. The CAS will now announce its final decision on August 16 at 9:30pm IST. In what added to the mystery surrounding the case, a scheduled press conference (via Zoom) with IOA president PT Usha and Harish Salve, representing the association in the case, was cancelled without any explanation or update. Reporters who clicked on the meeting link at the scheduled time got an \"invalid\" message.",

    "raw_text": "The most important sports story of 2023 was the wrestlers' protest. It was unique in profile and scale, and ultimately duration: three of the country's greatest ever wrestlers took on the system - the wrestling federation, the sports ministry, the wider sporting ecosystem - for two protests in the heart of the national capital. Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, and several of their peers and contemporaries, were protesting against the running of the Wrestling Federation of India, specifically against the alleged serial sexual harassment of women wrestlers by its president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.\n\nThe story was reported in the media, but the narrative was always hostage to various competing perspectives, especially those of the people in positions of power. In her *memoir Witness Sakshi gives the wrestlers' side of the story. We already know the timeline from when the wrestlers first sat down at Jantar Mantar to the emotional scenes at Haridwar but Witness adds detail, especially the \"why\" and the \"how\" to the \"what\". And what emerges, in Sakshi's words, is a tale of broken promises, of how each stage of the protest was undone by naivete and misplaced trust, of how the protesters \"had been gamed\" by everyone else.\n\nThere's a caveat, of course, when reading this: It's Sakshi's version (and presumably that of Vinesh and Bajrang too). But when you consider who was on the other side, putting out one's own story becomes risky business, which adds credence to this.\n\nIt all started with someone very close to the wrestlers -- Babita Phogat, cousin to Vinesh and sister-in-law to Bajrang. Sakshi writes about how Babita -- whose connections with the BJP were public - convinced them all that she had a line to the topmost levels of the Indian government, and people in power would ensure the wrestlers would get justice. Babita convinced them to start the protest and then distanced herself from it; as the book notes, she was never at the protest site. For her it had been a big political game; for Sakshi and the wrestlers, they'd laid everything on the line. The brutality of this betrayal hit all three of them deep, but it was to be only the beginning.\n\nOver the course of the next few months, the wrestlers would feel the full force of the indifference (and opposition) of the Indian political machinery. They got a sample of it early on when, three days into the protest, they met the then Union sports minister, Anurag Thakur. In an emotionally charged environment, as Sakshi and her fellow women wrestlers detailed their harrowing encounters with Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, Thakur sat emotionless, with an expression that indicated he just wanted it all to be over with.\n\n\"Anurag Thakur sat there, listening quietly,\" Sakshi writes. \"There was no emotion on his face. If he was shocked by anything he heard, he didn't show it. His reaction was in complete contrast to everyone else's. As each of us told our stories, the atmosphere in the room became steadily more emotional. Some of the younger girls were already breaking down in tears. But Thakur could have been listening to someone talking about the weather. It was as if he was bored and just wanted our meeting to be over. \"\n\nWhile still at Thakur's house, Bajrang received a call from Union home minister Amit Shah, who assured them of action being taken against Singh. On that assurance, and despite their reservations, they called off their initial protest. The moment they did that, though, Sakshi knew something was off. \"I broke down,\" she writes. \"I had done everything with absolute sincerity, and despite that, I'd been tricked. It felt as if the wind had been kicked out of my stomach\"\n\nThakur then said Singh would be withdrawn from the daily functioning of the federation, which would now be run by an oversight committee. It would include, on Sakshi's suggestion, Mary Kom, whom Sakshi held up as a role model for her fearlessness and champion attitude.\n\nThis initially gave the wrestlers hope. On hearing Sakshi's account of her harassment by Singh, Mary even told her that it was similar to what she had experienced too, that she would ensure Sakshi and the wrestlers got justice.\n\nOne of the more harrowing passages in the book is Sakshi's description of the wrestlers who'd made allegations against Singh testifying before the IOA committee investigating the charges:\n\n\"All of us thirteen female wrestlers sat in the same room and told our stories, one after the other. It was difficult for the younger ones, but they knew that their seniors were standing right alongside them. One of the girls telling her story was very young... She started to cry as she recalled this, and the other young girls started to cry too. Once they began to weep, I couldn't control myself. I started tearing up, and then Vinesh did too. The women members of the committee who were listening to us, and finally the woman lawyer, who were in the same room, started to cry too. They started to hug the girls who were testifying. They said 'Please don't cry, we will get you justice. Don't worry.'\n\nMary Kom too said she would get us justice. It was a very emotional moment for all of us, but it was cathartic too. Finally, everyone had to started to understand what we were dealing with. Their tears told us they believed us. Now they would go to the IOA and the government and tell them just how rotten the state of Indian wrestling was.\"\n\nNothing happened, however. The final report that the committee submitted had nothing of substance in it. \"Were the committee members' jobs and positions so important to them that they couldn't even stand up for what was right? That they couldn't admit that women wrestlers in the country were facing sexual harassment,\" writes Sakshi.\n\nFriends, politicians, and now fellow sportspersons had all thrown them under the bus. They learned from this (or thought they had), and for the second protest, there was no easy appeasement, no falling for false promises. The book details the hardships they faced while spending days and nights in the open in the Delhi summer, but also the kindness of strangers, of ordinary Indians -- mostly farmers from Haryana -- who would come to the protest, show their solidarity and give them money for the cause.\n\nEventually, the wrestlers took their protest to Hardwar, where they planned to immerse their medals into the Ganga. In the drama that unfolded, with calls from various political and social leaders, only person emerged a winner -- the farmer leader Naresh Tikait, who snatched away the medals from the bewildered, emotionally charged wrestlers' hands, and nullified the whole protest. \"Within a couple of minutes,\" she writes, \"we realised what a tremendous mistake we had made. What was supposed to be a great act of defiance had turned into a complete farce. Not only had we not been able to get Brij Bhushan Singh out of the federation or give up our medals, but we had also broken our word to the people who had supported us.\"\n\nThat broke the back of the protest but the final nail, she writes, came from Shah and Thakur again, when they promised to listen to the wrestlers' requests and ensure a woman candidate would become president of the federation. This is when they finally decided to get off the streets completely -- only to see Singh's cronies hoisted into power in the elections a few months later, with not a woman administrator in sight.\n\nThe defeat had been total. Having started the protest with the intention of forcing Singh out of power, of trying to ensure his crimes were paid for, it had all ended with the sight of Singh celebrating loudly, garlands around his neck, all the power still ensconced in his clenched fists.",

    "raw_text": "PV Sindhu has never returned from an Olympics without a medal.\n\nPV Sindhu has never lost to a player from China, one of badminton's heavyweights, at the World Championships or the Olympics.\n\nBoth of these are extraordinary facts that, with her other achievements, elevate Sindhu to the Indian sporting pantheon. Both of these streaks ended at Paris Olympics on Thursday, when Sindhu lost to China's He Bing Jiao in straight games in the pre-quarterfinal.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nPoignantly, this loss came exactly three years after she had beaten the same player in the bronze medal match at Tokyo to win her second Olympics medal - the first Indian female athlete to do so.\n\nA sad day for Indian sport but, as Sindhu said emotionally after the match, she should keep her head held high. She played her best, doing everything she could to shake off the effects of two injury layoffs and put herself in medal contention as the 10th seed. She may not have been a medal favourite but, given her calibre and track record, Sindhu is the kind of player no one would ever count out.\n\nIf this was the last time we saw Sindhu at the Olympics, it will be a bittersweet ending. There will obviously be pride at everything she's done but also the realisation this is the end of something unique: an Indian athlete staying consistent and commanding across two Olympics and performing well enough to be a top-10 seed at the third.\n\nFew other Indian athletes have that kind of longevity at the Games. And Sindhu did it in a sport as physically draining and logistically demanding as badminton, where players have to compete across the globe in 14-16 BWF events as individuals and a few more for their country.\n\nShe's done it for more than a decade now, starting as a teenager who stunned the world, and the Chinese, to win her first World Championship medal in 2013. She's won four more since, becoming the world champion in 2019. The most successful Indian player of the past decade, with or without a medal in Paris. That's something no one can take away from her.\n\nHer consistency at the biggest of stages captured the imagination of an Indian audience beyond sports fans and made her a household name.\n\nNow, though, there's a new reality for Sindhu, and for Indian sport too: she is no longer a reigning Olympic medallist. And that raises uncomfortable questions: Will she have the same level of motivation after a deflating loss to a player she has beaten before? Or will she slowly fade away, like her predecessor Saina Nehwal did, neither retired nor an active player after injury woes and age caught up? Does she have another Olympics in her?\n\nShe is 29 now and will be 33 by the time of LA 2028, an age where most top badminton players have passed their peak. Especially the ones with her kind of physical playing style.\n\nHowever, with her fitness levels and skill, it will be difficult but not entirely impossible for Sindhu to prolong four more years if she truly wants to. Or at least the two more years for the Asian and Commonwealth Games, the big multi-sport events where Sindhu has always excelled. The lack of successors to her in Indian women's singles could also be a factor: there is no other young Indian player who can push her out of the Indian team - or, indeed, push her to newer heights, as has happened with HS Prannoy - as of now.\n\nThere are no easy answers but one thing is for certain, Sindhu will not go just yet. For all her success, she has goals still to achieve. Big titles on the BWF Tour, more shots at the World Championship. She is not one to brood over losses. The long streak of silver and bronze medals bear witness that she always come back to fight irrespective of the previous result.\n\nShe's in good shape to continue too. Despite her physical struggles in the last couple of years after the stress fracture she sustained en route the 2022 Commonwealth Games gold, she has managed to stay in the top 10-15 of the world rankings. Despite no titles in the last two years and lopsided final losses, she has pushed the top players like Carolina Marin and Chen Yu Fei in 2024.\n\nWhere will we see Sindhu next? Perhaps not at the Japan Open, which is the next scheduled competition on the jam-packed BWF World Tour. It's a Super 750, which makes it a mandatory event for top plyers unless injured. Perhaps she takes a break after planning her season around peaking at the Olympics. All will depend on her mental state once she processes her exit.\n\nThe match itself was a metaphor for her form in the last two years. Coming very close in the first game but losing it from the clutch position of 19-19. Getting completely outplayed in the second game, the fight dimming after not being able to match up to her opponent's pace.\n\nThis was not a version of Sindhu India has seen at the big stage. She has always been the fighter who stays in points, rallies, games till she can. The marathon epic 2017 World Championships final against Nozomi Okuhara. The Rio Olympic final against Carolina Marin. Both losses but those where she left her all out on the court.\n\nThursday's match, though, was a marker of the sands of time. The sad reality is that Sindhu's levels have dipped. Her peak is not world beating as it once was. She did everything she could to get ready for this moment. She changed her team and coaches, moved her base from Hyderabad to Bangalore, made new mentor Prakash Padukone travel to tournaments for the first time and added facets to her game at the age of 29. It wasn't enough in the end.\n\nShe was more philosophical as she said, \"It's sad. The result, I couldn't get what I expected, but it's a journey, isn't it? It's been a wonderful journey so far. There were ups and downs, and I came back from an injury, and everything was going on well. You can't expect easy wins or picking the form at the right time. Sometimes it might not be your day.\"\n\nFor almost a decade Sindhu was Indian badminton. She took over the mantle - and the weight of expectation that comes with it - from Nehwal and now sees younger male players, Sat-Chi and Lakshya Sen, jostling for that space. They may yet earn that space - Lakshya, especially, has time on his side - but Sindhu, as she's done all her career, will make them fight for it. She's down, but she's not out.",

Northwestern beat Liberty 2-0 in 2021 before losing to North Carolina the past two seasons.\n\nNo. 4 seed Saint Joseph's (20-4-0) was in uncharted waters with its first trip to the final. The Hawks eliminated top-seeded North Carolina in the semifinals to advance. The Tar Heels have won the championship in half of their 22 trips to the final.\n\nNorthwestern grabbed the lead 6:25 into the first quarter when Zimmer used an assist from Tromp to score. Zimmer had an assist on Olivia Bent-Cole's eighth goal of the season for a 2-0 advantage, and Tromp found the net with 25 seconds left with assists from Lauren Hunter and Ashley Sessa for a 3-0 lead.\n\nHunter and Sessa again had the helpers on Zimmer's 10th goal of the campaign, and Hunter and Regan Cornelius assisted on Tromp's 11th goal of the season 2:42 later for a 5-0 lead at halftime, and that was that.\n\nAnnabel Skubisz finished with her school-record 14th shutout of the season for Northwestern. Zimmer and Tromp are the second duo to score multiple goals for their school in a championship match. Zimmer was named the tournament MVP.\n\nIt was the second championship for Wildcats coach Tracey Fuchs.\n\nNorthwestern joins North Carolina and Old Dominion as the only schools to reach the championship match in four straight seasons. Six schools have won multiple titles.",

    "raw_text": "The Court of Arbitration for Sport, in its ruling denying wrestler Vinesh Phogat's appeal to be awarded a joint-silver medal at the Paris Olympics, stated that despite the consequences of a failed second weigh-in being draconian, it was on athletes to ensure that they are within the permissible weight limits for their respective events.\n\n\"A consequence of elimination without ranking from the round for which the Athlete was found ineligible, having been eligible for the rounds for which she competed, would seem to be a fairer solution,\" the CAS order said.\n\nThe order stated that there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on Vinesh's part, but there was no provision within United World Wrestling (UWW) guidelines for athletes who had failed the second weigh-in. Instead, the guidelines explicitly state that wrestlers are only eligible for rankings if they clear the weigh-ins on both days of competition.\n\nHowever, it also said that the formation and validity of UWW's policies were not before the arbitrator and there was no evidence or submission against such policies.\n\n\"The problem for the Athlete is that the Rules are clear as to the weight limit and are the same for all participants. There is no tolerance provided for - it is an upper limit. It does not even allow for the weight of the singlet. It is clearly up to an athlete to ensure that they remain below that limit,\" the order stated.\n\nUWW guidelines leaving room for ambiguity\n\nThe order stated that both Vinesh and the Indian Olympic Association had raised a number of arguments based on the construction of the rules, which it called \"not clearly drafted\" and that some of the wording could be taken out of context as well.\n\nThe ambiguous framing of Article 11, which states that if an athlete fails the weigh-in, \"he will be eliminated,\" was a point of contention for the IOA, which stated that there were no consequences mentioned in the UWW guidelines for female athletes who failed the weigh-in.\n\n\"Reading the Rules as a whole, the Sole Arbitrator concludes that the use of the word \"he\" was not intended to exclude female wrestlers from the application of the Rules or of Article 11; rather it was the use of a pronoun intended to cover all wrestlers, male and female,\" the order stated.\n\nThe IOA, not Vinesh, also raised the argument of whether the Olympics counted as an \"International Tournament\" under UWW guidelines, which allow for a 2 kg weight tolerance in such events. However, CAS cited several articles of the UWW guidelines to conclude that the Olympics weren't categorised as an \"International Tournament\" and that said weight tolerance would not be allowed in it.\n\nEffects of menstruation\n\nThe IOA had submitted that \"the biological difference in the bodies of male and female wrestlers, particularly in light of the menstruation of women, needs to be taken into account whilst determining the eligibility of female wrestlers on the second day of the weigh-in\". It produced a medical certificate dated August 8, 2024, stating that Vinesh was in her pre-menstrual phase, and cited medical literature on the effects of menstruation on body weight changes.\n\nIn response, the order stated: \"While it may be the case that the Athlete experienced some bloating and water retention, this is unquantified and, as a condition that may occur during the menstrual cycle, would be expected to be a factor that was mitigated against to ensure that the Athlete remained below the weight limit.\"\n\nLogistical challenges during weight cut process\n\nVinesh had also cited the effects of having to eat and drink for the sake of her health, between her three bouts on the first three days of competition. She also cited the distance between the wrestling venue (Champ-de-Mars Arena) and the Olympic Village, leaving her with little time for the processing of losing weight.\n\nVinesh had asserted that complying with the 50 kg restriction undermines her bodily integrity, but the Sole Arbitrator shot down the argument saying that the Indian had willingly entered the 50 kg category and had achieved much success in that category.\n\nFaulty weighing scales\n\nThe IOA also stated that the scales used during the weigh-in already read 50 grams when no one weight was placed on them. While noting that there were no faulty scales used during the weigh-in, the CAS order states that it still would have still left Vinesh 50 grams above the permissible limit.\n\nThe order from CAS concluded by stating that the Sole Arbitrator does not have the power to award medals. That was a power which only the IOC had. The IOC contended that it only awards medals based on rankings, and that Vinesh wasn't ranked in the competition owing to her disqualification, which made her ineligible for a silver medal, as she had appealed.",

    "raw_text": "Federal prosecutors disputed claims by Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter that he stole from the slugger to pay back massive gambling debts, saying there was no evidence he suffered from a gambling addiction before he started draining the Los Angeles Dodgers star's bank account, according to court documents filed Thursday.\n\nIppei Mizuhara is due to be sentenced Feb. 6 after his June guilty plea. Last week, he asked U.S. District Judge John W. Holcomb for an 18-month sentence, instead of the nearly five years prosecutors seek. Mizuhara said he was remorseful and blamed the crime on what he called a \"long-standing\" addiction to gambling in which he \"frequented casinos four to five times a week.\"\n\nBut in their new response, prosecutors doubled down on their sentencing recommendation and said their research showed there was no evidence of a long-standing addiction other than Mizuhara's \"self-serving and uncorroborated statements to the psychologist he hired for the purposes of sentencing.\"\n\n\"All defendants claim to be remorseful at the time of sentencing,\" prosecutors wrote. \"The question courts must answer is whether the defendant is truly remorseful or whether they are just sorry they were caught.\"\n\nMizuhara's attorney, Michael Freedman, declined to comment Thursday.\n\nProsecutors said the government's investigation found \"only minimal evidence\" of Mizuhara's past legal gambling, stating that investigators had looked at more than 30 casinos across the country and that \"the only evidence found was defendant spending $200 at the Mirage casino during a weekend in 2008.\"\n\nProsecutors attached a document containing a color photocopy of Mizuhara's California driver's license, along with spreadsheet images showing bets he placed at the Mirage.\n\nMizuhara registered for an account on FanDuel in 2018 but never placed a bet on the website, according to prosecutors. He began betting with DraftKings in 2023 after he \"had already stolen millions of dollars from Mr. Ohtani,\" the filing states.\n\nOther exhibits showed Mizuhara placing bets ranging from $5 to $1,400 on NBA, NHL, soccer and college baseball games.\n\nProsecutors contend Mizuhara did not accumulate a \"tremendous debt\" that forced him to steal from Ohtani, as Mizuhara has claimed. At the time of the first fraudulent wire transfer from Ohtani's bank account, for \"a modest $40,000\" in September 2021, Mizuhara had more than $34,000 in his checking account, prosecutors said.\n\n\"[Mizuhara] could have used his own money to pay the bookie but instead chose to steal from Mr. Ohtani,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nThey allege Mizuhara deposited money he received from his winnings from the bookie and DraftKings into his personal account and \"had no intention of repaying Mr. Ohtani.\"\n\nIn his filing to Holcomb, Mizuhara claimed that he \"had to rent a place\" near Ohtani and \"paid hefty rent\" where he ultimately settled in Newport Beach, California, while simultaneously paying rent for an apartment in Japan. He also stated in his filing that he was \"living paycheck to paycheck.\"\n\n\"But this is also not true,\" prosecutors wrote in their filing, submitting bank statements as evidence showing \"he was using Mr. Ohtani's debit card to pay his rent\" without Ohtani's \"knowledge or authorization.\"\n\n\"He had no expenses,\" the prosecutors continued. \"He had no loans, car payments, or rent expenses,\" noting Ohtani gave Mizuhara a Porsche to drive.\n\nMizuhara always had a \"significant balance\" in his checking account, prosecutors state, noting it was more than $30,000 in March 2023 and more than $195,000 in March 2024, when inquiries from ESPN led to his firing from the Dodgers and to Ohtani's attorneys calling the wire transfers a \"massive theft.\"\n\nProsecutors also said Mizuhara turned down book and commercial deals in spite of Ohtani encouraging him \"to accept the deals.\" Mizuhara \"did in fact write at least one book\" -- an illustrated children's book about Ohtani, according to an exhibit.\n\nProsecutors concluded their filing by stating \"a significant period of incarceration is necessary,\" and reiterated their request for a sentence of 57 months in prison, three years supervised release, more than $16 million in restitution to Ohtani and $1.1 million to the IRS.\n\n\"There is no doubt\" Mizuhara \"feels ashamed from the international attention he received from his fraud schemes and web of lies,\" the prosecutors wrote. \"But instead of showing true remorse,\" they allege, Mizuhara is trying to \"justify stealing millions from Mr. Ohtani.\"",

To make that happen, though, he needs to start stringing wins together (especially as other big players start finding their feet on tour)\n\nHS Prannoy had a steep 5-place drop this week as he was unable to match his semifinal run at India Open last year. He has, of course, been away from the Tour for five months with multiple health issues, and is finding his feet again this year.\n\nThe world No 1 remains China's Shi Yu Qi while reigning Olympic Champion Viktor Axelsen climbed a spot to world No 4 after his India Open win.\n\nP.S. Kiran George's heartening quarterfinal run after being promoted from reserves at the India Open gave him a 3-spot boost up to world No 35.\n\nWomen's Singles Rankings\n\nPV Sindhu, 12 (+4)\n\nMalvika Bansod, 27 (--)\n\nSindhu, who reached the quarterfinal in her first tournament of 2025, looked sharper and faster but could not handle the three-game toil against a top player - an increasingly familiar pattern. It did, though, give her a four rank boost as she looks to regain form.\n\nMalvika had a tough start to 2025, running into world No 4 Han Yue in the last two weeks... but she did show incremental growth by taking a game off her in Delhi.\n\nThe world No 1, undisputed at that, remains South Korea's An Se Young (she also won the India Open).\n\nMen's Doubles Rankings\n\nSatwik-Chirag, 9 (--)\n\nThe only Indian pair in the Top 40 of men's doubles went from reaching the finals of these two Opens to losing the semis at both this year. All four losses, though, followed a familiar pattern -- being outdone by a tactical plan of flat exchanges, no height and crafty use of the net. This is a blueprint that most opponents are figuring out and they, along with new coach Tan, will need to figure a solution ASAP.\n\nThe world No 1 pair remain Denmark's Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen, despite their horror start to the season with opening round losses.\n\nWomen's Doubles Rankings\n\nTreesa-Gayatri, 9 (--)\n\nAshwini-Tanisha, 19 (+3)\n\nNeither Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand nor Ashwini Ponappa and Tanisha Crasto have had a great start to the year with early exits despite being seeded in both tournaments they played.\n\nAshwini-Tanisha have moved up due to upheaval in the top pairs (changing partners), but the two duos have been unable to capitalise on it so far.\n\nThe top pair are South Korea's Baek Hana and Lee Sohee, who got there after China's indomitable pair of Jia Yifan and Chen Qingchen parted ways.\n\nMixed Doubles Rankings\n\nSikki-Sumeeth, 31\n\nAadya-Sathish, 32\n\nThis is a curious discipline for India, with no big results but a sizeable number of pairs making major main draws despite early losses.\n\nThe world No 1 pair remains China's Feng Yan Zhe and Huang Dong Ping.",

    "raw_text": "And then there were six. After 132 matches, we're down to the final six teams who will battle it out for the Pro Kabaddi League [PKL 10] title over the next week.\n\nPKL 10 Playoffs LIVE: Dabang Delhi vs Patna Pirates; Haryana Steelers vs Gujarat Giants\n\nESPN tells you everything you need to know ahead of the PKL10 playoffs.\n\nOk, so who are the final six?\n\nPuneri Paltan: the table-toppers and last season's runners up.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers: the defending champions.\n\nDabang Delhi: PKL 8 champions.\n\nGujarat Giants: two-time runners up.\n\nHaryana Steelers: Back in the playoffs for the first time in three years.\n\nPatna Pirates: THE most successful team in PKL history\n\nHow do the playoffs work?\n\nSo four teams will face off in the eliminators on February 26 and the winners will progress to the semifinals on the 28th. The final of PKL 10 will be played on March 1.\n\nBy virtue of finishing among the top-2 teams at the end of the league stage, Puneri Paltan and Jaipur Pink Panthers have a direct slot in the semifinals. Puneri Paltan will play the winner of the eliminator between Dabang Delhi and Patna Pirates, while Jaipur Pink Panthers will face either Gujarat Giants or Haryana Steelers.\n\nTell us a bit about the first two matches..\n\nDabang Delhi vs Patna Pirates\n\nA classic clash between two raiding units. Both teams average around 17 raid points each game and Dabang Delhi are successful in 40.36% of their raids. They have the mercurial Ashu Malik in their ranks, who has not only seamlessly transitioned into the captain's role since Naveen Kumar's injury but has also cemented his name as one of the best raiders in PKL10. He is currently on 257 raid points, the second-most this season. On the other end of the mat is Patna Pirates captain Sachin Tanwar, who also took up captaincy mid-season and leads his side's raiding duties.\n\nThe two deciding factors could be the efficiency of the defences [where Dabang Delhi have a slight edge] and do-or-die raids, which is an area that no one can match Patna Pirates.\n\nGujarat Giants vs Haryana Steelers\n\nThis a traditional defensive battle, with both coaches widely known for their water-tight backlines. Gujarat Giants are led by PKL's most successful captain in Fazel Atrachali and his presence on the mat makes all the difference for them. He leads from the front, while Sombir and Deepak Singh have ably supported him. They have struggled with their raiding as their raiders have all performed in flashes, but Parteek Dahiya has found form in the last few games and will be their go-to man.\n\nManpreet Singh, who had earlier coached the Gujarat team, has the league's best defensive combination of Jaideep Dahiya and Mohit Nandal. Add Rahul Sethapal to the mix and the three have a combined total of 194 tackle points, which is 10 lesser than what the entire Bengal Warriors team had in 22 games. They also lack a primary raider, but have plenty of options such as Siddharth Desai, Vinay. Shivam Patare and Vishal Tate.\n\nWho are the players to watch out for?\n\nAshu has been Dabang Delhi's raiding extraordinaire and their talisman this season. How he shapes up in such a crucial phase, as both captain and raider, will be interesting to see. A player who will be keen to find form will be Patna Pirates' Krishan Dhull, who had a superb season but has been patchy in the last few games. He's the league's second-best defender with 73 tackle points and will look to increase his tally. Also keep an eye out for Sachin, there isn't anyone in the game who is as good as him in do-or-die raids.\n\nParteek will be keen to Gujarat Giants' fortunes and another x-factor in their team is Sonu Jaglan. The muscular raider has shown us glimpses of his brilliance, especially in their home leg when he came off the bench to cull out some incredible wins. Haryana Steelers will bank on their defence and hope Siddharth, aka Baahubali, turns up in these crunch matches.\n\nWhat's the PKL 10 playoffs schedule?\n\nFebruary 26: Eliminator 1: Dabang Delhi vs Patna Pirates at 8 pm, Eliminator 2: Haryana Steelers vs Gujarat Giants at 9 pm.\n\nFebruary 28: Puneri Paltan vs winner of Eliminator 1 at 8 pm, Jaipur Pink Panthers vs winner of Eliminator 2 at 9 pm.",

    "raw_text": "Aman Sehrawat lost to Japan's Rei Higuchi in the semifinal of the men's 57kg category at the Paris Olympics on Thursday. Despite the loss, Aman still has a shot at making the podium as he will compete in the bronze medal playoff against Puerto Rico's Darian Toi Cruz on Friday.\n\nHiguchi, the silver medallist from the 2016 Olympics and former world champion, was always going to be a tough opponent. Aman had looked dominant in his initial two bouts but was no match to Higuchi's lightning-quick attacks.\n\nDAY 13 LIVE BLOG INDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nWithin seconds of the start, Higuchi latched onto Aman's left arm and threw him over his shoulder for four points. There was nothing Aman could have done to evade that -- Higuchi was too clinical. The Japanese went for a gut wrench soon after but Aman did well to find his way out of it. It was the first time he had to defend on Thursday and he wasn't given time to adjust to Higuchi's pace.\n\nThe 2022 World champion dived at Aman's right leg and inflicted the takedown to make it 6-0 just a little over a minute into the bout. Aman's defence came to the fore again as he used all his strength to stop Higuchi from pinning him, but it merely delayed the inevitable as Higuchi latched onto Aman's right leg once again and rolled him over again with a gut wrench to close out the contest. A win by technical superiority inside three minutes.\n\nAman came into the semifinal as the outright underdog, but his win over Albania's Zelimkhan Abakarov served as a massive boost -- and a chance to get revenge for the thrashing he received when the two last met at the 2023 World Championships. He did just that, locking Abakarov's ankles and rolling him four times to win by technical superiority inside two minutes.\n\nWhat Aman did was stick to his strengths: attack. It's how he has always approached the sport; he takes pride in his lightning-quick footwork and all-out attacking maneuvers, which were on display against Abakarov.\n\nAman's first bout of the session against Macedonia's Vladimir Egorov was a similar affair. Aman came to Paris as the youngest freestyle wrestler in the 2024 Olympics and it was his first bout at such a level. There was no sign of nerves; he dictated the bout from start to finish and pulled off four single-leg takedowns enroute the win.\n\nAman is the sole male wrestler from India at the Olympics and his performance in the first two bouts Paris justified his tagging as the biggest name in Indian wrestling today. Ironically, he is in Paris at the cost of his mentor, Tokyo Olympics silver medallist Ravi Dahiya -- they are in the same weight category and only one could go to the Games.\n\nA product of the Chhatrasal Stadium academy -- from where all of India's recent Olympic medallists have emerged -- which he joined at age 10, he made his debut at the senior level in February 2022, has fought in 42 bouts since and won 33 of them for a winning percentage of 78.5%.\n\nHe will have a chance to seal his 34th win in two years, which will be his career's biggest win when he takes on Cruz for the bronze medal at 11:10 PM on Friday.",

    "raw_text": "It's a testament to the men's Hockey India League's quality that just one point separated the top four teams going into the semifinals. Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers, who finished on top with 19 points, will take on fourth-placed Tamil Nadu Dragons in the first semifinal. JSW Soorma Hockey Club, who also got to 19 points but finished second, will face Hyderabad Toofans in the second semifinal.\n\nHere's a closer look at each semifinal with key players and battles to watch out for:\n\nShrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers vs Tamil Nadu Dragons at 6 PM\n\nWhile Bengal Tigers finished on top and Dragons fourth, it doesn't mean there's a big gap in quality between both the teams. Dragons, in fact, were leading the table for a long time before suffering a couple of defeats in the final stretch of matches. There really isn't much between these two sides. In the league stage, Bengal scored 24 goals and conceded 22 while the Dragons scored 22 and conceded 23.\n\nOne area where Bengal have an edge over the Dragons is penalty corner conversion. The in-form Jugraj Singh has scored nine goals from dragflicks this season, the best in the league. He's also the second highest-scorer in the league overall, behind Vedanta Kalinga Lancers' Thierry Brinkman, who scored 10. Rupinder Pal Singh, too, has chipped in with five goals, includes two from penalty strokes. Head coach Colin Batch will be pleased that his team has two in-form dragflickers going into the knockouts.\n\nThe Dragons have Jip Jansen as their main dragflicker and he has scored seven times so far. However, their main strength has been their midfield with the likes of Mohammed Raheel, Tom Craig, Uttam Singh, Thomas Sorsby and Martin Zwicker impressing with attacking nous and relentlessness. In their last league match against UP Rudras, Dragons were trailing 0-2 and were in danger of not qualifying but it was their midfield who turned things around by continuously winning the ball in the middle of the pitch.\n\nIt's a tough one to predict since these two teams are equally matched but if Dragons continue to give penalty corner chances to their opponents in the semifinals, they will come back the next day and play the third place playoff instead of the final.\n\nJSW Soorma Hockey Club vs Hyderabad Toofans at 8:15 PM\n\nHere, too, the face-off is between two evenly matched teams. Soorma, captained by Harmanpreet Singh, have the same number of outright wins as Toofans, who are being captained by Harmanpreet's defensive partner in India colours - Sumit. However, Soorma finished ahead on points thanks to three shootout wins to Toofans' two.\n\nThe best part about Toofans has been their Indian setup with impressive performances from Amandeep Lakra, Arshdeep Singh, Shilanand Lakra, Rajinder Singh and Talwinder Singh. All these players have played only a few games, if any, for India but have shown tremendous promise, which is of course good news for Indian hockey.\n\nToofans have plenty of goals in them, with Gonzalo Peillat converting six penalty corners so far and Tim Brand scoring six field goals. There's Amandeep who has been a big revelation when it comes to penalty corners, scoring thrice while Maico Casella, Arthur de Sloover and Jacob Anderson have also contributed. Not to forget, Sumit and Nilakanta Sharma have been at their usual best. It has been a proper team performance by the Toofans, with most of their players standing up when their team needs them to be.\n\nSoorma also have goalscorers with as many as 10 players scoring at least a goal each but their biggest strength has been two world class specialists. Harmanpreet Singh had a relatively slow start to the campaign but he has since scored five penalty corner goals. Another important aspect of Harmanpreet's game has been his creative passes from the back, which are effective in breaking down a tough defence.\n\nThe other important player has been 37-year-old Vincent Vanasch, clearly this tournament's best goalkeeper. And the best thing about Vanasch is he raises his game a notch in big matches. Soorma will hope that the big man in goal becomes a wall in their quest to become champions.\n\nGurjant Singh and Prabhjot Singh have also stood up with their work rate and efficiency in the circle. Gurjant scored thrice while Prabhjot has two goals to his name.\n\nLike the previous semifinal, this one is also a tough one to predict but the battle to watch out for is Toofans' free flowing attackers against one of the best goalkeepers in the world.",

She was the first Indian woman wrestler to participate in three Olympics, the first to reach an Olympic final, the first Indian woman wrestler to win gold at the Asian Games, and the only Indian woman with multiple world championship medals in wrestling.\n\nHere are all the accolades Vinesh won over her career:\n\nOlympics\n\n2024 Paris Olympics - Final* (50kg)\n\nVinesh reached the final of the 2024 Paris Olympics on the back of a stunning 3-2 win over Yui Susaki of Japan in the round-of16 bout, bringing an end to the defending Olympic champion's unbeaten (84-0) record. Vinesh went on to beat Oksana Livach and Yusneylys Guzman of Cuba to become the first Indian woman to reach an Olympic final in wrestling.\n\n*Vinesh was later disqualified from the Olympics after failing to make weight on the morning of her gold medal bout.\n\n2020 Tokyo Olympics - QF (53 kg)\n\nVinesh went in as the world no. 1 but lost in the quarterfinal to two-time world champion Vanesa Kaladzinskaya of Belarus (who went on to win bronze).\n\n2016 Rio Olympics - QF (48kg)\n\nMaking her Olympic debut as a 21-year-old, Vinesh had to drop weight categories. In the 48kg quarterfinal against Sun Yanan of China, Vinesh suffered an ACL tear and had to bow out. She was conferred the Arjuna Award later that year.\n\nWorld Championships\n\n2022 Belgrade Worlds - Bronze (53kg)\n\nVinesh lost to eventual silver medallist Batkhuyagiin Khulan of Mongolia in the first round but went on to win bronze via the repechage route, defeating two-time European champion Jonna Malmgren of Sweden - and thus became the only Indian woman wrestler with multiple world championship medals.\n\n2019 Nur-Sultan Worlds - Bronze (53kg)\n\nVinesh qualified for the Tokyo Olympics on the back of her bronze at the 2019 Worlds, which came about after a loss to three-time world champion and Tokyo gold medallist Mayu Mukaida of Japan. Vinesh beat Paris gold medallist Sarah Hildebrandt and three-time worlds medallist Maria Prevolaraki of Greece in the repechage to win bronze.\n\nAsian Games\n\n2018 Jakarta - Gold (50kg)\n\nVinesh achieved some catharsis by defeating Sun Yanan (whom she had lost to in the Rio Olympics after her ACL injury) in the Ro16, and eventually beat two-time Asian champion Yuki Irie in the final. It was Vinesh's first gold medal at the Asiad and the first gold by an Indian woman wrestler in Asian Games history.\n\n2014 Incheon - Bronze (48kg)\n\nA 20-year-old Vinesh became only the third Indian woman to medal at the Asian Games in wrestling, taking bronze via the repechage route after losing to three-time world champion and Rio Olympics gold medallist Eri Tosaka of Japan.\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\n2022 Birmingham - Gold (53kg)\n\nFollowing the heartbreak of Tokyo and her subsequent tiff with the WFI, Vinesh bounced back by becoming the first Indian woman to win three CWG golds, defeating worlds medallist Samantha Stewart of Canade en-route.\n\n2018 Gold Coast - Gold (50kg)\n\nVinesh was making her comeback after the injury heartbreak of Rio and responded in some style, winning all her bouts and defeating former world champion Jessica MacDonald of Canada to win gold.\n\n2014 Glasgow - Gold (48kg)\n\nJust a month shy of her 20th birthday, Vinesh achieved the biggest victory of her career till then by claiming gold (48kg) in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, defeating two-time European medallist Yana Rattigan of England in the final.\n\nAsian Wrestling Championships\n\nVinesh has medalled in every Asian Championships she has entered - earning four bronze (2014 - her first international medal, 2016, 2019, 2020), three silver (2015, 2017, 2018) and a solitary gold in 2021.\n\nPersonal accolades\n\nVinesh became the first Indian to be nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award in 2019, and in 2022 was also nominated for the BBC Indian Sportswoman of the Year.\n\nVinesh was conferred the Arjuna Award in 2016 and was awarded the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna in 2020 - both awards that she returned (left near the Prime Minister's Office) during the wrestler protests in 2023.",

    "raw_text": "It was the best of redemption acts, but Janneke Schopman insists she doesn't think of it this way. Schopman-coached Odisha Warriors became the first ever champions of the Women's Hockey India League, beating JSW Soorma Hockey Club 2-1 in an engaging final in Ranchi.\n\nIt's the same Ranchi and the same stadium where last year Schopman's India stumbled in their Olympic qualification journey against Japan. It was also a painful blow for Schopman's coaching career but a year on, she is full of happiness.\n\n\"I don't look back, I came here because I really like the franchise. The fact that they only have a women's team, the fact that it was Odisha, it's close to my heart. The state has done so much for hockey. If I can contribute to bringing some pride to Odisha then it's a big honour for me,\" Schopman told journalists after the match.\n\nShe's right of course. There is no point in looking back but there's no denying the cinematic nature of her vindication as coach. There is also no denying that India's failure to qualify for the Olympics came under her coaching. She was expected to take the national team a level up since the Tokyo Olympics but instead, India, at least in the big tournaments, couldn't deliver on the promise. Under her, India played good hockey, but inconsistency derailed her ship. It was a painful defeat, with her reign ending post her allegations of gender discrimination. Hockey India never completely addressed her concerns and accepted her resignation stating: \"It is time to begin a fresh chapter in Indian women's hockey with the players progress being at the centre of our focus.\"\n\nAt that time, nobody would've bet that Schopman would return to India and taste success.\n\nBut life always shows a way. The much-awaited Women's Hockey India League began and there she was, back again in the country after accepting a challenge to build a team of foreign and Indian players and guiding them to the trophy.\n\nIt was not a perfect team, at least on the field. But none of that matters now. Before the tournament began, the questions were how Schopman could bounce back after the setback with the national team. Couldn't Odisha Warriors have picked a different coach with less baggage?\n\nTo her credit, she was involved heavily in the auction and picked a solid team that looked like favourites even before they stepped on the field. There was Yibbi Jansen, the best dragflicker in the world. There was Jocelyn Bartram, one of the best goalkeepers. There was Victoria Sauze, one of the best midfielders. And there were the likes of Neha Goyal, Sonika, Baljeet Kaur, Nisha, Deep Grace Ekka -- the best of the young and experienced from India.\n\nBut assembling a team is one thing. Living up to the exceptions is another thing altogether. While the Warriors played to their strengths, thanks to Jansen's penalty corner goals, they finished second best in the league below the superior team in Soorma, who played free-flowing, attacking hockey. Before the final, the big question was their over-reliance on dragflicks and not scoring the field goals. Schopman once again took on the challenge and defied it.\n\nSoorma was successful in denying the penalty corner opportunities for Jansen but Warriors responded by scoring two field goals. Young forward Rutuja Pisal showed immense composure and finishing skills to score twice. First, an instinctive flick to give her team the lead in the 20th minute and then a powerful strike four minutes from full time to ensure victory.\n\nSchopman knew about Rutuja's potential when she was under her in the junior program and the team paid 4.9 lakh for her in the auction. She didn't score before the final but there was no loss of faith in her. \"I know Rutuja for a very long time. She was in the junior program when I was coaching. She's someone with a lot of energy, works really hard for the team. She's not always lucky because she's very rushed in the end phase. But today, she was exactly where she needed to be, I was very happy with her performances throughout the tournament. Today, she got the reward, which was really nice,\" Schopman said.\n\nAfter the final hooter on Sunday, the camera showed Schopman, whose face showed genuine happiness. There were no big emotions, no yelling, no tears, nothing like 'I proved you wrong'. Post match, she was not keen to put the focus on her. \"I'm happy for the girls, also for myself, and the staff. Everyone works hard. I'm here because I love hockey and coaching. It was a great challenge to bring players from different countries together, but it was fun to do. I'm happy we won and happy for the girls,\" she said.\n\nHappy, loving hockey, and fun. Schopman ends January 2025 with these words. Who would've thought about it a year back?",

    "raw_text": "Not long ago a sport confined largely to villages and children's playgrounds, kabaddi has come a long way, conquering large swathes of urban India and going as far afield as Iran, South Korea and even the USA. The Pro Kabaddi League is now the most-viewed sporting league in India after the Indian Premier League and is riding its success to expand into a longer tournament with more teams when Season 6 starts on October 7.\n\nBeyond all the numbers and factoids, though, and possibly the ubiquitous chant, kabaddi remains a mystery, even to many Indians. So here are the basics about the game that could help you make sense of it when the madness descends.\n\nIt's a quickie\n\nMatches last 40 minutes, divided into two equal halves with a five-minute break.\n\nThe Tom and Jerry show\n\nRemember watching Tom and Jerry, where the cat used to run after the mouse, who kept devising ways of saving himself? It's roughly the same in kabaddi. Each team - comprising defenders, raiders and all-rounders - is gathered on either side of a line; then the match starts.\n\nReady, set, raid!\n\nIf cricket can be reduced to each delivery when bowler bowls to batsman, the essence of kabaddi comes down to this: raiders try to attack and defenders try to... well, defend. Each instance is known as struggle. In a struggle, one player (the raider) from Team A crosses the line to Team B; he has 30 seconds to try and touch a Team B player and make it back across the line. Team B, meanwhile, will try and evade him (defend) or, once touched, stop him from going back to his half. What eventually stops the struggle is a point of cease-fire where either the defenders manage to hold the raider before he could move back to his side or when the raider forces himself to the mid-line, thereby completing a successful raid.\n\nEvery successful raid gives the raiding team one point; if there's no touching in those 30 seconds it's an empty raid and gets no points. A super raid is roughly the opposite of 'empty'; it's when a raider manages to touch more than two defenders and move to his side of the court, and a team can score as many points as the number of defenders the raider has touched. Then there's the Do-or-die raid: if a team has two successive empty raids, they have to send a raider to go out and score and if he fails, he must sit out till they are revived again.\n\nDefend till you drop\n\nDefence is as important as raids (but perhaps a bit simpler to understand). Defenders defend themselves and their side from the hands and feet of the raider (literally!) by preventing him from touching them and their teammates. If he does, their job is to hold him and prevent him reaching his half of the court. Also, the defender who was touched has to sit out till \"revived\" (more on that in a bit).\n\nLike successful raids, successful tackles too yield one point each. The Super Tackle - where a raid is stopped when there are just three or fewer defenders left on court - scores two additional points.\n\nRevivals are real\n\nSo what's a revival when it's not on Game of Thrones? Well, every successful raid point and tackle point gives a team an opportunity to bring back the players who had to sit out after being touched. However, revivals aren't applicable for Bonus points - a lucky point that can be scored by a raider if he puts his forefoot on the bonus line, located 4.75 (approx.) metres from the mid-line.\n\nAll out (for a bit)\n\nAn All-Out occurs when all seven members of a playing team are forced to sit out because of unsuccessful raids and tackles. The team enforcing the All-Out gets two extra points before the other is allowed to continue.\n\nJust cant stop\n\nNo, that's not a typo up there. It's plain and simple: you just can't simply stop the cant when you're playing kabaddi. What is a cant anyway, you ask? Well, it's what you and I would call a chant (but kabaddi's too cool for that); it's the 'kabaddi kabaddi' phrase that raiders have to repeat while attempting a raid. The c(h)ant needs to be loud and clear and if the raider stops, he has to sit out. Movie buffs can check out the film Pardes, where Shah Rukh Khan plays kabaddi in one scene; he keeps chanting 'kabaddi kabaddi' continuously, almost breathlessly, while attempting a raid despite being blocked by a whole bunch of defenders. The raid is successful (obviously!) and his team goes on to win the match.\n\nThat's kabaddi for you in around 600 words. But the best way to understand is to watch it. Better still, play it. It's one game sure to leave you breathless.",

    "raw_text": "Puneri Paltan vs Haryana Steelers. The best PKL team ever vs giant-slaying first-time finalists. A first-time champion in the offing. The stage is well and truly set for the Pro Kabaddi League [PKL 10] final.\n\nHow did they get here?\n\nPuneri Paltan did what they have done all season -- decimate their opposition. Last season's runners-up beat PKL's most successful team ever -- Patna Pirates by a massive 16 points to make it to their second final on the trot. This was their 18th win in 23 matches -- they have lost just two. That should tell you just how good they are.\n\nFor a team that lost their opening match by 30 points, Haryana Steelers have truly enjoyed their best season since joining PKL in season 5. Manpreet Singh's boys qualified for the playoffs by finishing fifth and made it to the semis with a gritty win over Gujarat Giants. What followed that win was one of the biggest upsets in PKL history as they hammered defending champions Jaipur Pink Panthers to earn their first shot at the title.\n\nP.S.- Haryana Steelers are the first team not ranked among the top-2 at the end of the league stage, to play in a final.\n\nWhat sets these two teams apart?\n\nPuneri Paltan: They simply can't seem to put a foot wrong. They have scored the most points [922], the most tackle points in PKL 10 [340], have inflicted the most All Outs [45] and have conceded the least points among the 12 teams [653]. Their raiders can defend, defenders can raid...you get the point. There's a reason why they're considered the best PKL team of all time.\n\nHaryana Steelers: They have defended fiercly. A young team with no bonafide superstar, each player has performed beyond expectations. And that's what has made them so effective: you just don't know what to expect from them because there's a new hero in each game. For a team that has no marquee raider, they have the most raid points [1045] and the most super tackles [33]. Their defensive trio of Jaideep Dahiya, Mohit Nandal and Rahul Sethpal have a total of 209 tackle points, which is more than how many the entire Bengal Warriors team had in 22 games.\n\nWhat happened when they played each other this season?\n\nHaryana Steelers are one of the two teams to have beaten Puneri Paltan this year. Sample that. They picked up a 44-39 win when they met back in December, but Puneri Paltan bounced back with a comprehensive 51-36 victory when they met again in Panchkula last month.\n\nWho are the key players?\n\nMohammadreza Shadloui: He's always been a good defender. This year, he's become one of PKL's best-ever defenders. The Iranian left corner has 97 tackle points to his name, just four away from the highest tackle point tally in PKL history. He has 11 High 5s to his name [also a PKL record] and is a livewire on the mat. Oh, and he can raid too.\n\nAslam Inamdar: Puneri Paltan's captain cool. The fact that he is roughly the same age as his teammates makes his mature approach to captaincy all the more remarkable. He is a superb raider, an excellent exponent of the bonus point and is also a very useful defender.\n\nMohit Nandal: Haryana Steelers' superstar in the right cover position. He forms a lethal combination with Jaideep Dahiya [they're called Jai-Mo] and can change a game on its head. He had been an integral part of Haryana Steelers' water-tight defence and if he's on-song, it's very hard to get past him.\n\nVinay: The #1 raider among Manpreet's men. His dodging skills are second to none and he has a unique ability to wriggle out of tackles. He has more often than not delivered for Haryana Steelers and has shouldered their raiding duties with great confidence. He's also, currently, PKL 10's ninth-best raider.\n\nAny fresh faces who could pull off a surprise?\n\nWatch out for Haryana Steelers' Shivam. All of 18 years of age, he's been a revelation in his debut season. He made Jaipur Pink Panthers' Reza Mirbagheri look like a rookie when he beat him five times in the semis and also outsmarted Sunil Kumar and Ankush Rathee for fun. He's a left-raider, which immediately makes him a tricky customer due to the lack of left-raiders and has a very clever head on his young shoulders.\n\nAnother player to watch out for is Akash Shinde. Puneri Paltan have an all-star team and Akash has often been benched, but you can count on him in crunch situations. He's quick, has a superb running hand touch and can stun a defender with a reverse toe touch.\n\nAny storylines to look out for?\n\nWill history repeat itself?\n\nSo, U Mumba finished as runners-up in season 1 and emerged as champions in season 2. Dabang Delhi lost the final in season 7, won the title the next year. Can Puneri Paltan keep the trend going?\n\nManpreet's quest for a title\n\nManpreet won the PKL title as a player with Patna Pirates in season 3. He then took to coaching and steered Gujarat Giants [then called Gujarat Fortunegiants] to two successive finals in PKL 5 and 6 but finished second-best on both occasions. He is now one match away from becoming the first to win the PKL trophy as a player and coach.\n\nThe PKL10 final starts at 8 PM on Friday, March 1 and will be available on Star Sports Network and Disney+ Hotstar.",

Songs like \"When You Come Back to School.\"\n\nThis is also where you would have found Scott Beigel for the past 28 summers. He first came to Starlight as a reluctant camper whose mother, Linda, gave him prepared fill-in-the-bubble notes to send home to Long Island. He returned, year after year, until he became a beloved staff member. Photos on the camp's Facebook page show his growth over the years -- and the constant sense of fun that made him so popular.\n\nFor two months a year, Starlight was his home. As for the other 10 months, well, Scott couldn't quite find the same feeling of stability. That is, until the summer of 2017, when the trail from Starlight led him to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, 1,300 miles away in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThere was an opening for a ninth-grade geography teacher, and Jeff Foster sensed that Scott, a University of Miami grad, would be perfect for the position. When Foster is not teaching AP American government at Douglas, he is the athletic director at Camp Starlight. \"I thought Scott was a natural fit,\" Foster says. \"His campers loved him, and they were the same age and basic demographic as the students he would have at Douglas. He was easygoing, but at the same time he could command a room.\"\n\nFoster reached out to Denise Reed, the assistant principal, and Sandra Davis, the head of the social studies department, and they brought Scott in for an interview in June. They mentioned they also needed a cross country coach.\n\n\"Within five minutes, we knew,\" Reed says. \"He was someone we wanted to work with, and he was someone we knew the kids would love.\"\n\n\"He clearly loved teaching, and he made us laugh,\" Davis says. \"He had this funny, unassuming persona like Jerry Seinfeld. We spent most of the time pinching ourselves.\"\n\nAt the end of the interview, they ran into a Starlight camper and her mother. As Davis recalls, \"They told us, 'I don't know what you're interviewing him for, but you have to hire him.' Scott just shrugged and said, 'What can I say? I planted them there.'\"\n\nMARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS High is named for the legendary naturalist whose life work was the preservation of the Everglades. The sprawling school campus is in Parkland, a meticulously developed community in northwest Broward County that was once part of the Everglades. The school was named after Douglas in 1990, the year she turned 100. She lived to be 108.\n\nSince its inception, Douglas has been one of the best high schools in Florida, with a student body of about 3,300 and a dizzying array of sports teams and extracurricular activities. When junior Cameron Kasky found out that Beigel would be teaching at Douglas, he was thrilled. \"I knew him from Camp Starlight, and he was also my fifth-grade language arts teacher at Pine Crest School. I didn't much like Starlight, but he was the best thing about it. And I was kind of a jerk in fifth grade, but Mr. Beigel turned my thinking around.\"\n\nTeaching freshmen is not easy, Foster says, and Beigel was given a fairly heavy workload that included seven classes plus coaching. \"I think he found it a little overwhelming,\" Foster says, \"but once he overcame those doubts and gained confidence, I started hearing really good things about how he was engaging with his students.\"\n\n\"Mr. Beigel made school fun,\" says Kelsey Friend, one of his homeroom students. \"But he also made geography really interesting. We weren't just looking at maps. We were finding out what it was like to live in those countries.\"\n\nAs for his cross country responsibilities, Scott looked upon them with amusement-he had no real experience when athletic director Chris Hixon told him he needed someone, anyone, to take over the team -- and a dedication to physical fitness to match his runners.\n\n\"We knew more about running than he did,\" captain Nick Boyer says. \"But he made it fun, and he knew when to get serious. He turned out to be a great motivator.\"\n\nThe geography teacher had finally found his place.\n\nBut then came Valentine's Day.\n\nAt 2:19 p.m. on an otherwise beautiful Wednesday, Beigel was teaching Kelsey Friend and her class in Room 1256, at the top of the east stairwell on the third floor of Building 12. According to official accounts, that's when Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the school, arrived with a semi-automatic rifle concealed inside a duffel bag. It was just half an hour before dismissal.\n\n\"We were talking about the Winter Olympics in South Korea,\" Kelsey says. \"He had assigned us countries to follow, and he had Olympic music playing from his Apple Watch through the Bluetooth speakers, and he was dancing around and we were laughing. That's when the fire alarm went off.\"\n\nThe shooter had entered the east entrance on the first floor and began firing into different classrooms and the hallway, killing 11 people before climbing the west stairwell to the second floor.\n\nBeigel started leading his students down to the second floor, but as the shots reverberated and sounds of panic intensified, he took them back to Room 1256. Teachers on the second floor had bolted their doors and covered classroom windows. With no obvious targets, the shooter proceeded up the east stairwell to the third floor.\n\nBeigel had been trained to lock his door in an active shooting, but he also saw students outside. He kept the door open and ushered them into his classroom just before the shooter reached the third floor. The last student through the door was Matthew Zeif.\n\nWhen the gunman reached the top of the stairs, he shot Beigel six times from 5 feet away, and the teacher fell across the threshold to the classroom as students pressed themselves against the wall. According to one account, Beigel used his last breath to tell the shooter that the classroom was empty. Terrified, Matthew texted his older brother Sam, a senior who was sheltered in another room on a different floor: \"My teacher died. And he's sitting in the doorway.\"\n\n\"Mr. Beigel saved my life,\" Kelsey says. \"He saved so many lives.\"\n\nAt least 20 students huddled in the room.\n\nAfter reloading, the shooter killed five more people on the third floor before abandoning the gun and escaping down the west stairwell, mixing in with panicked students.\n\nWithin nine minutes of arriving at the school, he had killed 17 people and wounded 17 others. Of the fatalities, 14 were students and three were staff members who were trying to protect students: assistant football coach Aaron Feis, Hixon and Beigel. It wasn't until 82 minutes after his arrival at the school that the shooter was caught.\n\nLinda Beigel Schulman was on Long Island that afternoon, working as the office manager for her husband Michael's law firm. The day before, she had received a letter from her son, Scott, that was still making her smile. Linda had found his old camp lunchbox over the winter, filled with a bunch of blank notes, and she had sent the empty ones to him.\n\nPostmarked Feb. 10, the letter was addressed to \"Mother.\" Under the heading THE FOOD IS:, he wrote, \"What I eat when I'm hungry.\" Under THE KIDS ARE:, he replied, \"Smaller versions of adults.\"\n\nWhat made it especially touching was that Scott didn't really need to write. He talked to Linda nearly every day, usually after class or practice. She had raised her two children mostly by herself and was close to them. But for some reason, Scott didn't call at his usual time that day.\n\n\"I knew something was wrong,\" Linda says.\n\nMichael was out sick that day and called to tell her to come home. There'd been a school shooting in Florida. When she turned on the car radio, she heard on the news that one of the victims was a geography teacher.\n\nTHE FUNERAL WAS held on Sunday afternoon, Feb. 18, at Temple Beth El in Boca Raton, a strikingly modern Reform synagogue three blocks west of Dixie Highway, near where Scott lived in Deerfield Beach.\n\nWell before the 2 p.m. start, the pews in the sanctuary were filled with teachers and students, counselors and campers from Starlight, family and old friends from Long Island, as well as some interloping journalists.\n\nRabbi Greg Weisman gave an eloquent eulogy that compared Scott's life to \"The Unfinished Symphony,\" the masterpiece Franz Schubert hadn't completed before he died.\n\n\"During his 35 years with us,\" the rabbi said, \"Scott wove together so many people, so many experiences, so much joy, so many memories into a melody and a harmony that leaves us laughing and smiling through our tears of anguish.\"\n\nFor those who did not really know Scott, the desire to get to know him better increased with each of the speakers, including his sister, Melissa Zech; his girlfriend, Gwen Gossler; colleagues from Camp Starlight; Reed and Davis; and his father, Michael Schulman.\n\nThe last speaker was Linda. For all that she had been through-receiving the shocking news, scrambling to get a plane to Florida, dealing with the loss of a son with whom she talked every day, making arrangements and comforting others-she was remarkably poised and strong. And she was carrying the bright blue lunchbox she had given Scott when he was a camper.\n\nShe told the story of the notes, about the last one she received on Feb. 13. She talked about waiting for his call on Valentine's Day: \"Minutes passed like hours as I waited for your response. The rest is a total living nightmare, and I'm still trying to swallow the fact that there will never again be a response.\"\n\nThen she said that after she found out he'd been killed, she wrote a response to him anyway. She told him how amazing he was and that \"everyone you have touched will never be the same.\" She signed off with: \"Please let me know where you are. Mom.\"\n\nTwo days later, Scott's spirit was very much in evidence at Pine Trails Park in Parkland, about 2 miles north of the high school. The cross country team had organized a Run 4 Coach Beigel, a fitting way to honor him and revive community spirit. Those who wished could donate to the Scott J. Beigel Memorial Fund, which had been set up to send underprivileged kids to summer camp. In return, they got a hand-tied wristband with the beads \"M S D\" on it.\n\n\"This is the first day I've been able to smile,\" said Chad Williams, a senior on the team.\n\nSo on a lovely evening, joggers ran around the park 17 times-moms with strollers, dogs leading their owners, even police officers in full tactical gear. When they had finished jogging, members of the cross country team gave speeches. Said sophomore Annagrace Myers, \"Coach Beigel showed up at the very beginning of the year without a single clue about cross country, and yet he made a huge impact. He never taught us anything technical about running. He taught us how to run with our hearts.\"\n\nThe Schulmans showed up to thank the community and add their voices to the growing chorus demanding gun reform. Linda got a loud round of applause when she told the crowd, \"I promise that we are going to fix this, no matter what it takes.\"\n\nTHE CROSS COUNTRY team had every right to be proud of the Run 4 Coach Beigel. But proud was not how members described their feelings a few days later. They had gathered at a park in West Boca Raton to talk about coach Beigel -- Nick Boyer, Chad Williams, Kayla Sanseverino, Gabby Rumasuglia, Joshua Charo, Alyssa Fletcher and River Valladares were so familiar with one another and united in their fondness for Beigel that they seemed to speak as one.\n\n\"We were mortified.\"\n\n\"It was a disaster.\"\n\n\"Coach Beigel would've been laughing at us every step of the way.\"\n\nUh, what went wrong?\n\n\"For one thing, the 17 helium balloons that we brought to release into the air were deflated.\"\n\n\"And we had trouble lighting the candles.\"\n\n\"And we were supposed to give the speeches at 5 before people started running ...\"\n\n\"... but they took off at 5 ... and we couldn't do anything to stop them.\"\n\n\"Coach would've loved that.\"\n\nAnd then they traded memories from the season, of meets and meals and the trip to the state championships in Tallahassee.\n\n\"Here's the kind of advice he would give us before a race,\" Nick Boyer says. \"He'd say, 'Remember. If you get too tired and need to drop out, just make sure you take a runner from another team with you.'\"\n\nEverybody laughed.\n\n\"A lot of his humor was dry,\" Nick says. \"You had to know him.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but we loved him,\" Chad says.\n\nEverybody nodded.\n\nOut of the mouths of high school students. You had to know him.\n\nOn that November trip to state, Nick got to know coach Beigel a little better because he sat up front with him. It was a nine-hour trip, he said, so they had to leave around 5 a.m. Several girls qualified as a team, and River qualified individually. Nick went along for support. \"We're all sleepy, but before long, coach was cracking jokes and making us laugh,\" Nick says. \"On the ride north, he and I talked a lot about colleges-I didn't know where I was going yet, and he gave me some pretty good advice.\" (Nick would decide to go to the University of North Carolina.)\n\nNobody, of course, knew Scott Beigel better than his mother. Even in that first week of mourning, Linda readily agreed to talk about Scott. \"He loved sports. He especially loved the Yankees. All of us Beigels did. Then, when I married Michael, we suddenly had a Mets fan in the house. That made for some interesting conversations.\n\n\"While we're on the subject, when he told me he was going to be the cross country coach, I asked him, 'What do you know about cross country?' He said, 'I don't know anything, but I'm going to learn.' And he did. Teachers make good learners. I was a teacher myself. And he grew to love those kids.\n\n\"Scott was just a big kid himself. But I was so proud of him, no matter what he was doing. He spent a couple of months teaching in South Africa. He liked to travel, and he would bring his experiences into the classroom. That's part of what made him such a good teacher. Another part was that he was selfless-he never wanted to take the credit.\n\n\"He was such a good teacher. He was such a good son. He was such a good man.\"\n\nErnie Rospierski, another ninth-grade geography teacher, worked most closely with Beigel. \"You wouldn't think we'd have much in common besides our jobs,\" he says. \"My wife and I have been teaching here for a few years, and he was new. We're from Michigan, he's from New York. But we hit it off right away. Over a couple of lunches, we came up with this idea for our geography classes. We'd use the Winter Olympics to teach the students not only about South Korea but about other countries as well, about sports they knew nothing about. So we came up with a fantasy league in which we assigned different countries to different students. It was amazing to see these kids from South Florida suddenly interested in biathletes from Norway.\n\n\"But then comes Feb. 14. ... One of the reasons Scott and I got along so well was that we shared a love for popular culture. One of our favorite silly movies was Idiocracy, the Mike Judge comedy set in the future. There's a character in there, the Costco greeter, who says, 'Welcome to Costco, I love you.' Well, it sort of became our catchphrase.\n\n\"That afternoon, I saw Scott at lunch, and the last thing I said to him was 'Welcome to Costco, I love you.' Silly as this sounds, I hope he knows I meant those last three words.\"\n\nSeveral weeks after the shooting, Sandra Davis agreed to talk about the geography teacher she hired last summer. \"I knew Scott was getting better and better as a teacher, but I didn't realize how much of an impact he had made until I took over one of his classes after we came back to school two weeks later. The students -- all of them, not just the ones who always shine -- were so engaged and so eager to show me what they had learned. ...\n\n\"I keep thinking of what he could've done here. I also keep wondering if he knew how well he was doing. He was only here six months. That's not enough time to get a sense of how well you're doing. ... That, to me, is the tragedy within the tragedy. Scott Beigel never found out how brilliant he was.\"\n\nDIX HILLS IS is a small Long Island community of 27,000 on the south edge of the town of Huntington. Before World War II, it was mostly farmland, and long before that, it belonged to the Secatogue Indians.\n\nLinda and Michael Schulman live in a beautiful home here, with four frolicsome dogs to keep them company. They married 12 years ago and not only work together but play golf together. It's a nice day in May, and they've agreed to pose for some photographs.\n\nA lot has happened since Valentine's Day, some of it good. True to her word, Linda has become a passionate and eloquent advocate for gun control. Scott's former camper and student, Cameron Kasky, founded Never Again MSD, which evolved into the March for Our Lives movement. The town of Huntington named a street after Scott. Kelsey Friend, who was in Scott's class that day, has been calling Linda regularly to fill in for Scott. Still ahead was commencement on June 3 and a June 19 fundraiser for the Scott J. Beigel Memorial Fund.\n\nBut answering calls and correspondence and staying busy only helps dull the pain a little. \"It's been 12 weeks now,\" Linda says with a sigh. \"I can't shake the feeling that we were robbed. That Scott was robbed.\"\n\nAmong the hundreds of letters the Schulmans have gotten are some from important people on both sides of the political spectrum. But one she treasures is from the six members of the Zeif family, one of whom is Matthew, the last student through the door.\n\nThe letter reads, in part: Within the plethora of students coming in and out of Scott's classes, somehow he managed to connect with Matthew and show interest in Matthew. He did it in a way that gave Matthew confidence in himself, something no teacher prior to Scott had even shown an interest in doing. He made Matthew believe in himself enough to not only complete things like projects, but he empowered Matthew to believe he could complete them well.\n\nPointing to that letter, Michael says, \"That's the thing. Scott's a hero, but not because he opened that door that day. He's a hero because he opened doors for people every day. That student who seems lost? Who sits alone at lunch? That was him once, and he would go out of his way to make him feel valued.\"\n\nScott Beigel's official resting place is the Temple Beth El Mausoleum in Boca Raton. But he's also in a lot of other places: Dix Hills, Parkland, Starlight. He is the geography teacher in front of a lively classroom, the coach behind the wheel of a van filled with laughing runners.\n\n\"Think how many minds Mr. Beigel opened,\" Cameron Kasky says. \"The way he opened mine. Think how many lives he saved, how many lives he changed. As far as I'm concerned, he's still very much alive.\"",

    "raw_text": "She had chosen the simplest of accompaniments: herself, on piano; a distinguished-looking man with a gray beard adding occasional fills on an organ, as in a church. But Aretha Franklin took her time. Lingering over every chord and elaborating on every phrase, she took nearly five minutes to sing a song she usually delivers in three, prompting a national audience to ask not what she was singing but what she was saying. She made \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d into something like a spiritual. Was it a gesture of thanksgiving or of defiance? Was it a prayer or a protest? 2016 had been a year like no other -- a year in which anybody singing the national anthem before a sporting event faced the very real possibility that the athletes gathered in the arena would decide to sit it out. Lions and Vikings players all stood for Aretha on Thanksgiving Day. But did she make the song her own in order to make the song their own? It was the national anthem, after all. It was supposed to belong to everyone. But when a singer makes it her own, whom does it belong to?\n\nSING IT.\n\nGo ahead, it\u2019s not that hard. Sure, it\u2019s supposed to be a challenge -- by now it\u2019s American opera. But we the people have been singing it for a lot longer than we\u2019ve been merely listening to it, certainly for a lot longer than we\u2019ve made it the province of divas. It\u2019s a couple of ticks past two centuries old, and for most of its existence we had to sing it if we wanted to hear it. And so we did; we sang it in all sorts of ways, even with all sorts of words. It wasn\u2019t holy writ, at least not at the beginning. It was just words a man wrote down on a folded-up piece of parchment paper to a tune in his head. The tune was already familiar, if not shopworn. It belonged to the people who sang it in taverns and music clubs, their tongues loosened by a little liquid courage. Nine years earlier, he\u2019d used the tune for another song, a sentimental ditty about a warrior\u2019s return. But now he\u2019d seen something; he\u2019d witnessed something and he felt the need to write down what he saw. He wrote down the first verse in the morning -- yes, by the dawn\u2019s early light -- on the British ship where he, as a gentleman, had been fed and politely detained. He wrote the rest in a hotel room in Baltimore. It was news, duly printed in the local newspapers almost as soon as it was composed, but more than that, it was meant to be sung, and so the news that Francis Scott Key reported in a triple rhyme has managed to stay news for as long as Americans have managed to sing it:\n\nOur flag was still there.\n\nIt is hard to remember -- hard even to imagine -- a time when the singing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d as prelude to the Super Bowl was anything less than a test of the singer\u2019s chops, patriotism, sincerity and resolve, proctored by something like half a billion of the world\u2019s eyes and ears. It is the part of the pageant that must rise above pageantry; the exclamation point delivered before the start of the sentence; the national gut check that signals, for many, the end of dinner and the start of the game; and, not incidentally, the biggest musical event of the year, at least in terms of the global audience it commands. No sooner do we learn who has been selected to sing than we begin wondering whether he or she is up to it, has the range, possesses the stature, represents both our nation and our time, and, most important, can hit the notes. It\u2019s the first cliff-hanger of the game, and the issue is not decided until the singer scales the heights demanded by the land of the free-eeeeeee ... and then manages to harmonize with the fighter jets summoned to split the skies overhead.\n\nBut it was not always a show of force. For the first, um, XV years of the Super Bowl, the performance of the national anthem was mostly something of a community effort, left to marching bands and local choirs, a beauty pageant winner and the kind of jazz trumpet players who are beloved by squares. The national anthem wasn\u2019t played at Super Bowl XI, and even after the NFL hired Jim Steeg to fashion the Super Bowl into a spectacle commensurate with the nation\u2019s-- and the league\u2019s -- sense of exceptionalism, the bookings could be casually arranged. Why did Cheryl Ladd, the replacement Charlie\u2019s Angel, sing the anthem for Super Bowl XIV? \u201cPete Rozelle ran into her at the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel -- that\u2019s how she was booked,\u201d Steeg says. Why did grandmotherly Helen O\u2019Connell warble the anthem a year later? Rozelle\u2019s second-in-command \u201cwas in love with Helen O\u2019Connell from the big-band era in the \u201840s.\u201d\n\nIt was Steeg\u2019s idea to hire a pop star for Super Bowl XVI. \u201cThe game was in Detroit, and I told Pete, \u2019There\u2019s only one person who can sing the national anthem in Detroit.\u2019 He said, \u2019Go ahead, kid -- go do it.\u2019 So we got Diana Ross, and she represented a change in everything we were doing. All of a sudden, you had star power.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that they were surprised by the length of it -- but that they absolutely enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nAretha Franklin in 2016\n\nRoss sang it a cappella in front of 81,000 people at the Silverdome. She never had a big voice, and as the first icon who had to figure out how to strike a balance with all that iconography, she was the last Super Bowl performer to ask the crowd for help-- to say \u201cSing with me!\u201d And they did; the players did, the coaches did, the fans in the nosebleed seats did, and their gathered voices, when you listen to them today on YouTube, sound not just like a rough chorus accompanying Diana Ross but like the echo of another age.\n\nFrancis Scott Key was not alone when he saw -- when he wrote -- that our flag was still there. He was in the company of the enemy, detained while it bombarded Fort McHenry, which stood athwart the harbor in Baltimore. The fort\u2019s defenders were being shelled from a distance that their own guns could not match, so all they could do was endure the attack by sea while the British dispatched a force to attack Baltimore itself by land. Thirty-one years earlier, the United States of America had disengaged itself from Great Britain by means of armed revolt, but now it was a young and very weak nation at war with an old and very powerful one, and the outcome was very much in doubt. A few weeks before, the British had entered Washington, D.C., and put many of its public buildings to the torch, including the Capitol and the White House. \u201cWe could very easily have been British again,\u201d says Jennifer Jones, who curated the Smithsonian\u2019s 2014 exhibition celebrating the bicentennial of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d \u201cThe Americans were this nagging problem that the British were trying to put down.\u201d\n\nWhat Key beheld on the morning of Sept. 14, 1814, was not just unexpected; it was, says Jones, the martial equivalent of a Hail Mary pass that won the game as time ran out. And the line that provides the central affirmation of the song he wound up writing is not just a declaration; it\u2019s the answer to an implicit question that animates the song\u2019s every verse and stanza. Was the flag still there? It was. British ships did not get by Fort McHenry; British troops did not enter Baltimore; the War of 1812-sometimes called our Second War of Independence -- confirmed America\u2019s global standing and foreshadowed the rise of American power. Key had gotten an inkling of that power; indeed, he\u2019d had a vision of its nature, which was to be continually under siege. It was a new kind of power, an almost oxymoronic kind of power, at once democratic and expansive, and so, to celebrate it, he married his vision to a song notorious, even then, for being hard to sing.\n\nThe song was \u201cTo Anacreon in Heaven,\u201d and it was composed for the members of an all-male British music society, who often sang its fusty lyrics while drinking. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s hard,\u201d says Mark Clague, a University of Michigan musicologist whose website, StarSpangledMusic.org, is the fruit of half a lifetime spent studying and performing the national anthem. \u201cIt\u2019s meant for a trained voice, an operatic voice -- it\u2019s a show-off song, which is why Key chose it. He was saying, \u2019Hey -- we just beat the British.\u2019 But you have to have range to sing it, and it\u2019s always been a scary song to sing.\u201d\n\nThere are five texts central to the American experiment: the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Gettysburg Address and \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d The first two are about invention; the last three are about reinvention amid the challenge and cataclysm of war. But only one has been set to music; only one was written to be sung and then left to the uncertain and invigorating mercy of a nation of untrained voices.\n\nShe did not look scared when she took the stage to sing the song. She looked casual, dressed in a white tracksuit, with her hair kept from her face by a white headband. She looked less like a trained singer than like a trained athlete, and that\u2019s how she sang the song -- like an athlete, living up to her moment.\n\nOf course, the moment was everything. When Whitney Houston sang the anthem for Super Bowl XXV in 1991, she was 27 years old, and the nation was at war in the Persian Gulf. Two years earlier, the Berlin Wall had fallen and America had emerged as the world\u2019s only superpower; now we were in the process of making short work of Iraq, as if to prove our historical claim. It was a rare match: a country and a singer, both at the height of their powers and both heartbreakingly unaware that they\u2019d ever be anything but.\n\nSteeg knew what he was seeing and hearing as soon as she opened her mouth. \u201cAll you had to do was look around,\u201d he says. It was a display of freedom -- force coupled with apparent ease, as if she were insisting on the most fragile claim of American exceptionalism, which is that the most powerful country in the world could remain perpetually innocent. \u201cHer performance elevated the whole thing yet again,\u201d Steeg says. \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d had changed the NFL by connecting it to patriotic pomp. But now the NFL had changed \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d by giving Whitney Houston a platform to assert that anyone singing it in her wake would be singing it for the highest possible stakes.\n\nIn Constitutional Law, there is a philosophy called originalism, which insists that the only way to interpret the Constitution is as written, and the only intentions that matter are the intentions of the men who wrote it. But there is no one way to sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Between 1814 and 1900, there were at least 70 different versions, says Clague, \u201cwith people writing new lyrics about woman\u2019s suffrage, about the peace after the Civil War, about the end of slavery.\u201d It is a musical argument against originalism. It is America\u2019s living document, and the law that made it our national anthem in 1931 said nothing at all about how it was to be sung or played.\n\nThis is not to say that you can sing or play it any way you want to. The United States is not a country with a state religion, but it has a state song, and somewhere along the line -- maybe, as Clague says, at the moment when the U.S. fulfilled Francis Scott Key\u2019s prophecy that it would become a great and powerful nation -- the song became sacred. The rituals around it became sacred, and compulsory. You might not have to sing, but you damn well have to stand, and you better take off your hat ... and if you do sing, you have to sing with humility, sincerity and respect, and without a hint of irony. It is the great tug-of-war at the heart of the song, the great tussle. As the Smithsonian\u2019s Jennifer Jones says, \u201cMusicians are free to make the song their own. Americans don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nOf course, if you sing it as a member of an American minority, it is almost a different song altogether -- you have to make it your own in order to claim it as your own, with some of the most memorable versions of the national anthem turning out to be the ones that were performed under conditions of siege. In 1968, Jos\u00e9 Feliciano, the blind singer born in Puerto Rico, sang \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d as kind of a gentle folk song before a World Series game between the Cardinals and Tigers, accompanying himself on guitar. He thought it was going to be a hit; instead, thousands of Americans responded with howls of derision, questioning not only his performance of the song but his very right to perform it.\n\nA year later, Jimi Hendrix stood before the tribes at Woodstock and made a song inspired by the War of 1812 the soundtrack to the war in Vietnam. A few years earlier, he had gone to England as an R & B guitar player; he had come back to the States as the embodiment of both psychedelia and revolution and had been playing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d ever since. He would wind up performing it 70 times. He was the closing act at Woodstock. He took the stage in the morning, and by the dawn\u2019s early light, he seemed to almost literally invoke the bombs bursting in air. He used his guitar to evoke a state of emergency, emulating air-raid sirens and also a state of mourning, playing a few bars of taps. His \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d was a warning, a prophecy, a threnody, an ecstatic dirge and, in the end, something akin to a public sacrifice. Hendrix did more than take liberties with a song dedicated to the cause of liberty; he gave birth to a tradition of the American anthem enacting the central drama of America itself, turning it into a song that dared singers and musicians to claim it for their own traditions, or no tradition at all. There was, before the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, Marvin Gaye\u2019s agonized slow jam, which turned out to be one of his last public utterances before his father shot him to death after an argument; there was, of course, Aretha; and, a full quarter-century ago now, there was Whitney, whose Gulf War performance is usually considered the capstone of anthemic orthodoxy but who dispensed with the song\u2019s stately European time signature -- it\u2019s a waltz -- and sang it with a bounce, four beats to the bar.\n\nThe song that declared Francis Scott Key\u2019s surprise that the flag was still there has become a song of surprises, with not all of them gift-wrapped. Sebastien De La Cruz was surprised at the reception his respectful rendition of the anthem received. As an 11-year-old mariachi singer from San Antonio, he was pressed into service to sing the anthem before the Spurs played the Heat in Game 3 of the 2013 NBA Finals. He sang in full costume, with a soaring prepubescent enthusiasm, and was shocked, the next morning, when he did an interview with a local radio station and all the questions were about the storm of racist comments his performance provoked on Twitter and Facebook. The experience changed him; it also changed his relationship with \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d so when he sang it last summer at the Democratic National Convention, he was not just a boy tenor who had grown into an adolescent baritone; he was, he says, a singer who sang the song for different people and for different reasons. \u201cWhen I sang at the Spurs game, I was trying to represent San Antonio to the world-to show what mariachi and Mexican-American culture was really about. At the DNC, I wanted to show that I stand for something -- that I stand up for my roots but also everyone else\u2019s roots, that I stand up for everyone who has problems in their life, especially about race.\u201d\n\nThe first question? The first question is simple, Mark Quenzel says: Who can sing it? \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult song, and it all comes down to who can sing it. Even some of the biggest stars in the world can\u2019t sing the national anthem.\u201d\n\nQuenzel is the presiding impresario of NFL Network, the arm of the NFL that produces the annual Super Bowl extravaganza. For the past six years, he has made his living selecting Super Bowl singers, a process he starts in the summer with an iron law: \u201cThere are no hunches when it comes to the national anthem at the Super Bowl.\u201d The singers who sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d on the first Sunday in February have to prove that they can sing it, either by having sung it or by being unquestioned prodigies of range and control.\n\nBut of course there are other considerations. \u201cWe look at it in terms of the overall image,\u201d Quenzel says. \u201cWe look at what our place in the world is, because as big as the Super Bowl is, we\u2019re part of a greater society. You\u2019re never bigger than the national anthem. So we try to respect it, we try to honor it -- the big word around here is unity. The singing of the national anthem is by definition a unifying event.\u201d\n\nHe is not unaware of the timing. He is not unaware that since Colin Kaepernick first employed the national anthem as an instrument of protest in the summer of 2016, at least 42 players from 17 NFL teams have joined him with protests of their own. He is not unaware that there have been at least 134 protests at professional, college and high school sporting events. \u201cOf course we take that into account,\u201d Quenzel says. \u201cBut we look at it as an opportunity. It doesn\u2019t change our basic premise that this should be a unifying moment, that this should be a time when people feel they have more in common than they have keeping them apart. We are focusing on the national anthem to make sure people feel included, that they feel that way about the anthem and about their country.\u201d\n\nFor the national anthem at Super Bowl LI, the NFL wound up picking someone who, in Quenzel\u2019s words, \u201cis a little more traditional\u201d and \u201cchecks all the boxes we\u2019ve been talking about\u201d -- someone who faces the daunting task not only of singing the anthem but of singing it as an exercise in national solidarity. But can anyone possibly live up to such daunting criteria? Can anyone sing for everyone, and will any player sit, kneel or raise a fist as the anthem is sung?\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t like what you hear or what you see during the performance of the national anthem, is there anything you can do? Well, as it so happens, yes --you can revert to originalism and do what Francis Scott Key meant for you to do: Sing it yourself. It\u2019s not that hard. Yes, the song is something of a turkey, but it\u2019s like the turkey compulsory for Thanksgiving, resistant of perfection but worth the fumbling effort. Something happens when you sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d not unlike what happens when you sing \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d because the victory it celebrates is likewise so fragile and fleeting. Our flag was still there: It is one of the central affirmations of American life. But it is also the answer to a question, and the question is consecrated in the impossibility of the song. So go ahead and sing: It might be opera, but you know the words. And the words know you.\n\nWhen Aretha Franklin sang \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d this past Thanksgiving, she sang it 16 days after an election that divided the country. She sang it when the atmosphere of suspense built into the song -- how will she sing it? -- was extended to the audience: How will we hear it? And so she made the Lions\u2019 domed stadium, Ford Field, into her own church, and she sang it as a kind of spiritual --\n\n\u201cIt was not done as a spiritual,\u201d she says, with a brisk snap of correction. \u201cIt was the national anthem as I felt it. That was my interpretation of the basic melody. The election had nothing to do with my performance. Nothing whatsoever. There is a basic melody that is tradition. And you have to respect the tradition. I added something at the end that had not been there. But I played the basic melody.\u201d\n\nBut the churchy sound of the chords she played on the piano and the time it took for her to play them, surely she --\n\n\u201cI did not do it as a spiritual,\u201d the Queen of Soul says, with extreme finality. \u201cI did it as the national anthem.\u201d\n\nAmen.\n\nTom JunodBefore joining ESPN as a senior writer, Junod wrote for Esquire and GQ. He has won two National Magazine Awards, a James Beard Award and the June Biedler Award for Cancer Writing. His work has been widely anthologized and his 2003 9/11 story, \u201cThe Falling Man,\u201d was selected, on Esquire\u2019s 75th anniversary, as one of the seven best stories in the history of the magazine.\n\nCo-written and recorded in 1924 by singer and blackface performer Al Jolson, California, \u201cHere I Come\u201d was performed to its full-out extent by the Ricardos and the Mertzes in a 1955 I Love Lucy episode of the same name. The foursome is on New York\u2019s George Washington Bridge, almost 3,000 miles from the Golden Gate Bridge, belting Open up / That Golden Gate! Mood: the American West is amazing, we want in, because all things are possible there. Cuban Desi Arnaz provides vaudevillian flourishes, Lucille Ball sings as if no one is listening, and they all look, as humans and as characters, like they are living their best lives.\n\nA few years later, Ray Charles covered \u201cCalifornia Here I Come\u201d for a 1960 concept album called The Genius Hits the Road -- it features his indelible \u201cGeorgia on My Mind:\u201d Whoa / Georgia / Georgia / No peace / No peace I find. Charles sings the Hoagy Carmichael composition with the kind of hate and hope that one might harbor for a home state that happily enslaved one\u2019s recent ancestors. Charles\u2019 \u201cCalifornia\u201d on the other hand -- A sun-kissed miss said, \u2018Don\u2019t be late\u2019 / That\u2019s why I can hardly wait -- unfurls with the swag and quandary of new freedoms.\n\nThere is of course the Beach Boys\u2019 1965 \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d and Tupac Shakur and Dr. Dre\u2019s 1996 \u201cCalifornia Love.\u201d Both hit singles surge with similar kinds of regional we-the-best-ness, however ironic or rebellious. When Shakur raps, Let me serenade the streets of L.A. / From Oakland to Sac Town / The Bay Area / And back down, if you are from California, and you love hip-hop, you can come dangerously close to saluting. And the beginning of his epic verse about liberty, and returning home? Out on bail / Fresh out of jail / California dreamin\u2019.\n\nThat\u2019s the secret of these home songs, these pledges of allegiance, these rah-rah warnings. Everybody has one. Or 10. I mean, we haven\u2019t even mentioned \u201cHotel California.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has an actual anthem -- the song about it that has mattered most since the rock era -- and it\u2019s the immortal \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe most compelling versions of the song (and there are many) are from Hugh Masekela, The Beach Boys, Bobby Womack, the Four Tops, and a 2015 cover from Sia, for the soundtrack of Dwayne Johnson\u2019s San Andreas. The most famous and beloved recording of \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019\u201d is the gorgeously folk 1966 single from The Mamas and the Papas. There\u2019s deep comfort in the call-and-response, and in the fever dream, when lost, of familiarity. There\u2019s also frank selfishness -- If I didn\u2019t tell her / I could leave today. And the foursome\u2019s seamless harmonies shimmer with what can in retrospect seem to be the victory of being counter to a culture from within.\n\nThere is a bold and erudite 1968 rendering of \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019\u201d from Jos\u00e9 Feliciano that transcends all versions of the song. Blind from birth, the Puerto Rico-born and New York-bred Feliciano -- beautiful to look at with heavy dark bangs, mod wardrobe and daddy-o dark glasses -- had a massive hit with a soulfully flamenco interpretation of The Doors\u2019 signature \u201cLight My Fire.\u201d He had been on the coffeehouse circuit in New York City\u2019s West Village, then released three successful albums in Spanish. He wrote and performed the theme for the typically paternalistic 1970s sitcom Chico and the Man, and is most famous for \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d a holiday standard -- itself covered by everyone from the cast of Glee to Celine Dion to Luciano Pavarotti -- he wrote and recorded in 1970.\n\n\u201cDo you know, do you realize what you\u2019ve just done? You have created a commotion here.\u201d\n\nformer New York Yankee and Hall of Fame broadcaster Tony Kubek\n\n\u201cI owe a big debt to Jos\u00e9 Feliciano,\u201d songwriter and Doors\u2019 member Robby Krieger said in 1994. \u201cWhen he did it, everybody started doing it. He did a whole different arrangement.\u201d Released only a year after the Doors\u2019 original, the song turned Feliciano immediately into a star. \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019\u201d was the B-side of \u201cLight,\u201d and radio stations played it as much as the Doors\u2019 cover. He was a phenomenon.\n\nThe tempo of Feliciano\u2019s \u201cCalifornia\u201d is far more slow than the Mamas and the Papas\u2019 version (which itself is not quite the original). And when he says he\u2019d be safe and warm if he \u201cwas in L.A.,\u201d it\u2019s a Spanish-inflected \u201cEllay\u201d and calls to mind the palm trees dotting the barrios and middle-class enclaves of Central Los Angeles as much as the ones gracing Malibu, California. The original lyrics, by John and Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas, are, I got down on my knees / And I pretend to pray. Feliciano changes this to and I began to pray, and the song is lifted by this humility from the narrator. There\u2019s no shame in disenchantment, in pretending to pray. While we still have it, freedom of religion is of course as much about not worshipping, or performing faith as it is about practicing it.\n\nBut to actually pray, in a state that used to be mostly-Catholic Mexico, is a knowing script-flip. As are his soulful transitions from American English verse and chorus to Espa\u00f1ol ad-lib at about the halfway mark. It\u2019s a seamless joining. Feliciano is not Mexican, but this is a Latino singing quite literally about wanting California, and about feeling California. Feliciano moors \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019\u201d to the state\u2019s pre-American era, and makes the tremulous state steadier somehow, and more true. Plus his opening chords are deeply Spanish, and as John Phillips has said about Feliciano, \u201cThe way he plays the guitar, it\u2019s like the guitar must have been his friend.\u201d\n\nThe stunningly beautiful song functions as a knotty take on \u201chome,\u201d and \u201ccountry,\u201d and the success of it, as well the success from covering \u201cLight My Fire\u201d -- two massively popular, acclaimed rock singles -- likely gave him the courage to reimagine \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Feliciano was 23 when he walked onto old Tiger Stadium\u2019s left field with his guitar and his guide dog Trudy. It was a sunny day, Game 5 of the 1968 World Series in Detroit -- Tigers vs. the defending St. Louis Cardinals and the Cards were up, 3-1. Vietnam roiled; Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy had been killed; and Gov. George Wallace of Alabama had gained popularity on a platform of \u201csegregation forever.\u201d Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Baltimore -- aflame with discontent.\n\nTiger Stadium, from the tape, seems an isle of white-culture-dominated America girding itself for the poli-cultural battles it would have with the future: not just an MLB in which 30 percent of the players are of Latin descent, but a president with the middle name of Hussein, a first lady who knows all the Missy Elliott lyrics, and an NBA (integrated in \u201947) that is 75 percent black. That day at Tiger was a kind of bouffant and Brylcreem moment common across the United States -- looks all Mad Men-ish in the photos, but was of course overripe with exclusion. And as that well-constructed vibe rots and recedes, still it pushes back, pasting itself to the future with spit and glue, a tall and janky wall in the face of progression.\n\nBatter up, though, right? But before we get started, a nice Spanish guy who sings rock songs has been invited to perform -- in fact by beloved Tigers radio broadcaster (and sometime songwriter) Ernie Harwell. Detroit was still recovering from a summer of \u201967 uprising that had lasted five days. Persistent segregation and police brutality were cited as causes. Forty-three people died. Harwell had booked Marvin Gaye to sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d for Game 4. This was Gaye\u2019s clean-shaven, \u201cAin\u2019t Nothing Like The Real Thing,\u201d Tammi Terrell era, and the hometown hero, to cheers, had taken a traditional route.\n\nIn this era of assassination and pressured integration and -- Stop / Hey / What\u2019s that sound? -- black music continuing to prove itself the sound of young America, what could go wrong when it was Feliciano\u2019s time to be an artist and interpret a poem written (by a man with a strong distaste for blacks) in 1814 and set to music in 1931? What could go wrong if Feliciano, who \u201cwanted to sing an anthem of praise to a country that had given my family and me a better life,\u201d chose to resist the rockets\u2019 red glare?\n\nFeliciano\u2019s lean and gloriously singable version of the national anthem is, in his own words, \u201cslow and meaningful.\u201d It\u2019s also yearning and plaintive. He is America Dreamin\u2019 and he nailed it, as Trudy the smooth-haired collie stood by. The Tigers and the Cards were along the baselines, and the small band crowded behind Feliciano appears only mildly confused as he plays his guitar and sings with an intentional lack of bombast. The rendition has been described as \u201cgroovy,\u201d \u201cnotorious,\u201d \u201ca fiasco,\u201d \u201cLatin-tinged,\u201d \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201ccontroversial.\u201d People complained that his version was \u201cunpatriotic, a desecration.\u201d The Detroit Free Press called Feliciano\u2019s performance \u201ca blues version\u201d that hit an \u201cunresponsive chord.\u201d\n\nIn truth, it\u2019s ethereal. Feliciano\u2019s October 1968 version of the national anthem is too fine for this world. And when he arrives, beseechingly, at the home of the brave, it\u2019s as if he wants us all to live up to that historic or imagined courage -- and you can hear no applause or other kind of affirmation from the stands. Instead a kind of mass, low grumble emerges from the crowd. There was loud booing.\n\n\u201cBefore I had finished my performance,\u201d Feliciano said in an undated interview, \u201cI could feel the discontent within the waves of cheers and applause that spurred on the first pitch -- though I didn\u2019t know what it was about.\u201d Veterans apparently threw shoes at televisions. \u201cSoon afterwards I found out a great controversy was exploding across the country because I\u2019d chosen to alter my rendition of the national anthem to better portray my feelings of gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know, do you realize what you\u2019ve just done? You have created a commotion here,\u201d former New York Yankee and Hall of Fame broadcaster Tony Kubek said to Feliciano right after the performance. \u201cThe switchboard was deluged by calls. I mean you\u2019ve created a real stir.\u201d Feliciano said he was surprised. \u201cTony patted me on the back and said, \u2019Don\u2019t worry, kid, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I really enjoyed the way you did \u2019The Star-Spangled Banner.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter that happened,\u201d Feliciano said, \u201ceverything that I was doing, stopped. Radio stations stopped playing my records. It took me a long, long time, and even to this very day...\u201d The tape ends.\n\nFeliciano doesn\u2019t say what it took him a long to time to do. He doesn\u2019t mention, that Harwell -- a former Marine who was called a traitor and a draft dodger and a communist, and who came close to being fired for the booking -- said at the time that \u201ca fellow has to sing it the way he feels it.\u201d Feliciano doesn\u2019t mention on camera that an unauthorized recording of his rendition hit Billboard\u2019s charts. And though the major Detroit stations didn\u2019t play his version of the national anthem, within two weeks, the song had sold almost 50,000 copies in Detroit alone.\n\nPerhaps Feliciano means that even to this very day he can\u2019t believe how people responded as he sang his 23-year-old heart out. Maybe he means that even now, in his 70s, as he lives in Connecticut with his wife and continues to record and tour, that he can rest on laurels that include 85 million albums sold worldwide. He can bask in the glow of eight Grammy awards -- including for Best Pop Song for his \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d as well as for Best New Artist in 1969. Perhaps Feliciano was about to say that it took him a long time to realize his own influence on interpretive artists such as Jimi Hendrix in 1969, Gaye in 1984, and of course Whitney Houston in 1991. Maybe he was going to tell people that he is an artist, and he is sensitive about his \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d\n\nBest would be if he was about to remind folks that he takes pride in creating art about home being a never-ending quest for that which may never be truly seen -- or even felt -- except for on our most glorious or horrific days. And maybe, just maybe, as he stood at AT&T Park on Oct. 14, 2012 before Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, Feliciano thought to himself that this might be heaven, or it could be hell. It was forty-four years later -- San Francisco Giants vs. the St. Louis Cardinals -- and he was singing again at a postseason game our official national anthem in the manner of his very own self. And there\u2019s no doubt Jos\u00e9 Montserrate Feliciano Garc\u00eda heard the voices calling, from far away. The cheers for him at AT&T park were loud, proud, and unceasing. Those voices matter not nearly as much as one\u2019s own, but can as a chorus of belated praise feel deliciously sweet. Almost as if one is dreaming. It\u2019s a lovely place. It's a lovely place.\n\nDanyel SmithSmith is an American magazine editor and journalist and the culture lead for The Undefeated. Danyel is a 2014 John S.

A full decade before the United States of America came to a brief but full stop -- 2,977 people dead and more than 6,000 injured in three states. This was before three New York firefighters raised a star-spangled banner amid the sooty rubble of ground zero. In 1991, ground zero was just downtown Manhattan.

Buzz-sawed, climbed over and kicked through. Mandela is free, and Margaret Thatcher is out.

North and Saint West\u2019s late grandfather had not yet read his friend\u2019s letter to the world: \u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me,\u201d attorney Robert Kardashian said to flashing bulbs. \u201cPlease think of the real O.J. [Simpson] and not this lost person.\u201d This is the year Mae Jemison preps for the Endeavour, Michael Jordan is ascendant and In Living Color and Twin Peaks stamp the kids who make prestige TV glow in 2016. Beyonce is in elementary school. Steph and Seth Curry are in a Charlotte playpen. Barack Obama is the first black president -- of Harvard Law Review. The (pre)cursors are blinking.\n\n\u201cThis will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait,\u201d President George H.W. Bush says in August 1990, and by the dawn\u2019s early light of Jan. 17, 1991, a coalition of countries led by the United States drops real bombs on real people and real places in real time on four networks. This was the first Gulf War. There are no color-coded threat level advisory posters on airport walls, but the State Department and the Secret Service agree: The possibility of a terror attack is high, and Super Bowl XXV -- the Giants vs. the Bills, scheduled just 10 days later -- is a soft and glaring bull\u2019s-eye.\n\nThe Goodyear blimp? Grounded. A Blackhawk patrols instead. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue\u2019s annual Super Gala gala? Canceled. Concrete bunkers gird the parking lot of old Tampa Stadium, and a 6-foot-high chain-link rises quickly behind that. Canines sniff chassis, and ushers wave metal detectors.

For a Super Bowl.\n\n\u201c[It] was the shape of things to come,\u201d former defensive back Everson Walls recalled in 2013 for USA Today. \u201cThe security was incredible.

He\u2019d struggled with the decision, and it haunted him his whole career. But Commissioner Tagliabue will not have the regrets of his predecessor. Tagliabue -- a Jersey City basketball-playing attorney who\u2019d represented the league against the USFL -- arrived at Super Bowl XXV in a flak jacket. And he had Whitney Elizabeth Houston.\n\nHouston was 27 when she sang \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at Super Bowl XXV. She was already the first artist in history to have seven consecutive singles go to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 pop chart. This Whitney data, of course, does not yet include the zeniths and descents of the second half of her recording career. It doesn\u2019t include the impact she made on-screen in (and on the soundtracks of) 1992\u2019s The Bodyguard, 1995\u2019s Waiting to Exhale and 1996\u2019s The Preacher\u2019s Wife. It doesn\u2019t quantify, because there is no quantifying, the influence she continues to have on Beyonce Knowles Carter, Adele Adkins, Alicia Keys, Lady Gaga and other pop singers who rose in her wake. It can\u2019t articulate the profound relief she granted black teens in the mid-1980s. Just the sight of her, onstage, on MTV, on an album cover -- Houston was proof of life. It became easier for black girls in particular to flex, to breathe -- to revel in visibility and possibility.\n\nHouston wanted more than mainstream pop success. She wanted mainstream pop equality. \u201cNobody,\u201d she told Rolling Stone in 1993, \u201cmakes me do anything I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d And that had become the definition of her relationship with the music business. She\u2019d come by her ambition via nature and nurture and aspired to a level pop playing field that had been systematically denied her forebears. She was earwitness to artists who\u2019d thrashed and thrived in an intricately segregated music industry -- not the least of whom was her own mother, Emily \u201cCissy\u201d Houston, leader of the pop-gospel Sweet Inspirations, who sang behind Jimi Hendrix, Mahalia Jackson, Bette Midler, Linda Ronstadt, Aretha Franklin and more. Whitney was 6 when the Inspirations were singing backup for Elvis Presley in Las Vegas. \u201c[She] taught me how to sing,\u201d Houston said in 1996. \u201cTaught me ... where it comes from. How to control it. How to command it. She sacrificed and taught me everything that she knew.\u201d\n\nWhitney\u2019s distant cousin is pioneering operatic soprano Leontyne Price -- one of the first black singers to earn global acclaim in an art form still using yellow- and blackface in 2016. Whitney\u2019s first cousin is Dionne Warwick, who in partnership with Burt Bacharach (and in stride with Nancy Wilson) crystallized the acutely talented, crisply enunciated, pretty and sexually hushed black female pop star prototype that Whitney, for the first few years of her career, clicked right into. The fashion model\u2019s body type. The disciplined tamping down of racial and class signifiers. The gleam in her eyes and smile that said dreams are real.\n\nYou have to remember. She practiced for Super Bowl XXV. In a demure fur hat and with a case of nerves, Houston sang the national anthem at a Nets-Lakers game in New Jersey early in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 1988-89 retirement season. And she was in even better form for a February 1989 performance of \u201cOne Moment in Time,\u201d a song she recorded for the 1988 Summer Olympics Album. Houston wasn\u2019t featured in the video for the worldwide hit, but onstage at the 1989 Grammys, she made her ownership of the song clear.\n\nOn a large screen were slow-motion shots of triumph -- doves fly, FloJo receives a medal and Greg Louganis is poised to back-flip. The screen rose as Houston, in a white gown, stepped out with aplomb. There was a tiny cross at the base of her throat and a full orchestra in shadow behind her. \u201cYou\u2019re a winner,\u201d she belted, \u201cfor a lifetime.\u201d And then she allowed herself the tiniest of kicks -- of church -- and a step forward. And as she sang the words \u201cI will be free,\u201d three times in a row, in three different ways, the audience leapt to its feet.\n\nYou have to understand. Key to American blues is the notion that by performing them and by experiencing them being performed, one can escape them. \u201cI will be free,\u201d sang this black American woman to a mostly white, tucked-in-tuxes audience attending an event at which black achievement has been and remains segregated and minimized. This is our most familiar pop dance. This is white American affluence being comforted by the performance of black freedom -- and so, feeling forgiven. The polished intonations. The buffed exertion. The testimony. This is the conflation of mass sport and mass music. This is bodies and souls at work. This -- one of America\u2019s most influential creations and biggest imports -- is the uplift of big blues.\n\nJim Steeg was, for over 25 years, in charge of the Super Bowl for the NFL. Four years ago, he recalled the lead-up to XXV\u2019s opening ceremonies for SportsBusinessDaily.com: \u201cIn early January ... our coordinator of Super Bowl pregame activities Bob Best ... produced a recording of the Florida Orchestra for national anthem producer Rickey Minor. ... A week later, Minor flew to Los Angeles to have Whitney record the vocal track. Amazingly ... it was done in one take.\u201d\n\nYes -- Whitney Houston\u2019s version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d was prerecorded. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to rehearse the sound of the crowd ... coming at you,\u201d Minor said years later. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where the first note begins.\u201d\n\nThe NFL had no qualms about the song being prerecorded, even if Houston would be criticized for it. The NFL\u2019s issue was with the meter. \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d is written in 3/4 time -- not quite brisk, but waltzy. Houston and vocal arranger Minor, as well as bassist-arranger John L. Clayton, changed it to 4/4, slowing it down. \u201cAll was in place for what many of us thought would be one of the greatest versions of the national anthem ever performed,\u201d Steeg said.\n\n\u201cThen on Jan. 17,\u201d as Steeg further recalled it, \u201csenior executives with the NFL asked to hear the recording. A tape was overnighted to Buffalo, where the AFC championship game was played. The next day I was told the version was viewed as too slow and difficult to sing along with. Could I ask to have it redone.\u201d Perhaps the NFL was afraid there would be discontent in the stands, as there had been when Jos\u00e9 Feliciano dared to find himself and the times in the anthem before Game 5 of the 1968 World Series. So Steeg called John Houston, Whitney\u2019s father and her manager at the time. \u201cThe conversation was brief,\u201d Steeg said. \u201cThere would be no rerecording.\u201d\n\nYou have to understand: By slowing it down, Team Houston and the Florida Orchestra -- under the direction of Chinese conductor Jahja Ling -- not only increased the national anthem\u2019s level of technical difficulty, they amplified its soul. They made it the blues.\n\n\u201cAnd now, to honor America, especially the brave men and women serving our nation in the Persian Gulf and throughout the world, please join in the singing of our national anthem. The anthem will be followed by a flyover of F-16 jets from the 56th Tactical Training Wing at MacDill Air Force Base and will be performed by the Florida Orchestra under the direction of Maestro Jahja Ling and sung by Grammy Award winner Whitney Houston.\u201d\n\n-- Frank Gifford\n\nYou have to remember.\n\nIt\u2019s a fine warm winter night in Tampa.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 own Faultless Frank is on the ABC Super Bowl team. Every Hall of Fame hair is in place, and there are no signs of the brain trauma that will later plague him. Al Michaels has not yet uttered the phrase \u201cwide right.\u201d Madonna\u2019s \u201cJustify My Love\u201d and Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cLove Will Never Do (Without You)\u201d are battling on terrestrial radio, and terrestrial radio is the ruling class. There\u2019s no streaming. No YouTube. The iPod is 10 years away. Want to party? Hit the creaky shuffle on your CD player. At Tampa Stadium, the pregame jam is Snap\u2019s \u201cThe Power\u201d: It\u2019s gettin\u2019 / It\u2019s gettin\u2019 / It\u2019s gettin\u2019 kinda hectic.\n\nIt is, in fact. The ESPN team is broadcasting from outside the stadium. As Andrea Kremer reports at the time, \u201cEvery single vehicle within 200 feet of the stadium is completely searched. There will be a large, well-rehearsed team in place at Tampa Stadium. And it isn\u2019t just the Bills and the Giants but rather the security forces designed to safeguard the Super Bowl event while trying not to convey undue alarm to fans, or turn the stadium into an armed camp.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll was in place for what many of us thought would be one of the greatest versions of the national anthem ever performed.\u201d\n\nJim Steeg\n\nBut there are more than 1,700 security professionals on the grounds. And if it seems every person is waving a tiny U.S. flag, that\u2019s because a tiny U.S. flag has been placed on every seat. The field is a kaleidoscope of honor guard uniforms and team uniforms and kids doing a red, white and blue card stunt. Central is the entire Florida Orchestra -- standing in full dress, signaling serious and formal.\n\nThen Whitney Houston steps onto a platform -- it looks to be the size of a card table -- in a loose white tracksuit with mild red and blue accents. She has on white Nike Cortezes with a red swoosh. No heels in which to step daintily, and definitely not a gown. Her hair is held back by a pretty but plain ivory bandanna -- there are no wisps blowing onto her face. No visible earplugs to take away from the naturalness of the moment. Everything is arranged to convey casual confidence.\n\nHere we begin. Snare drums so crisp. Bass drum so bold. Houston holds the mic stand for a moment but then clasps her hands behind her back -- it reads as clearly as a military at-ease. Her stance says: We came to play. Says, in the parlance of the \u2019hood, and on behalf of her country: Don\u2019t start none, won\u2019t be none. All we have to do is relax, and we\u2019re all going to win.\n\nLike the best heroes, Whitney -- the black girl from Jersey who worked her way to global stardom, made history and died early from the weight of it -- makes bravery look easy. Although the stadium hears the prerecorded version, she sings live into a dead mic. The image of her singing is interspersed with faces of the fans, of the soldiers at attention and of the U.S. flag and flags of the wartime coalition countries blowing in the breeze. She is calmly joyful -- cool, actually, and free of fear. And when she arrives at Oh, say [cymbal] does our star- [cymbal] spangled banner yet wave, she moves to lift the crowd. It\u2019s a question. It\u2019s always been a question. And she sings it like an answer. People were weeping in the stands, weeping in their homes. The song itself became a top-20 pop hit. Folks called in and requested Whitney Houston\u2019s national anthem on the radio. The version NFL executives thought might be too slow, people sang along to as they drove down the street.\n\nSuper Bowl XXV is defined as much by the launch of Desert Storm and Security Nation and by Whitney Houston as by the game itself. That day was the start of a branding relationship between the armed forces and the NFL that has grown vinelike around a state of perpetual war.\n\nHouston is of course gone now, but she remains the ghost in the machine -- memorialized, memed, GIFed and in many quarters damn near prayed to. We have her massive ballads, and her bad reality TV, but her \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d is much the reason for Houston\u2019s continued presence -- she boldly interpolated our anthem and sang it as well as it will ever be sung. Remember? When her version was rereleased in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- Houston gave her fees to charity -- she roused and comforted a nation again. It was the last top-10 hit of her career.\n\nMost singers want out of that song. Most reach awkwardly for one note or another, or miss it altogether. It\u2019s not just that the song is a difficult one. It\u2019s difficult in front of people who want to feel the pride in the storybook words. They want to wave their ball caps and whoop in the pause after O\u2019er the land of the free. They want to be landlords in the home of the brave. Whitney\u2019s version made it all absolute, for a moment. Her arms were wide and reaching slightly up at the end, a pose familiar to many Americans, across races. Her head was back, as one\u2019s can be when victorious, and as one\u2019s can be when asking for and ecstatically receiving the glory of God.\n\nBright bulbs flashed and popped off behind her. Floodlights intersected with the hazy Florida sunshine and created stairways to heaven. You could almost walk up there. To where the four war jets are.\n\nYou have to understand.\n\nDanyel SmithSmith is an American magazine editor and journalist and the culture lead for The Undefeated. Danyel is a 2014 John S.

    "raw_text": "A perfect seven out of seven.\n\nThe revamped Indian women's hockey team under Harendra Singh won all their matches at the Asian Champions Trophy to defend their title in Rajgir, Bihar. Facing the Olympic silver medallists China in the final, Deepika scored the only goal of the match as the team's defence stood up under pressure and ensured they won their first trophy under the new captaincy of Salima Tete.\n\nIt was a richly deserved trophy for India as they were clearly the best team of the tournament, but this is just the start of a long journey towards Los Angeles 2028. There were positives but this team is still a work in progress.\n\nHere are a few key takeaways:\n\nIndia found consistency, scored goals\n\n... and more importantly, they didn't panic when the going got tough. One of Harendra's key objectives was to ensure India maintain their calm and improve their decision-making in key moments, especially inside the circle. Over seven matches, India have produced evidence that they have made improvements. They scored the most goals in the tournament (29), but what was really impressive was that they got the goals when they needed them the most.\n\nIn the two group matches against China and Japan and later in the semifinal and final against the same teams, India couldn't convert their chances in the first-half. However, they found ways to score in these matches and also ensured they didn't get frustrated and concede. All the four matches were not easy, but they still ended up scoring nine goals.\n\nLast year, on multiple occasions, they crumbled under pressure and made mistakes. It proved very costly in the Olympic Qualifiers which crushed their dream of going to Paris. Mistakes, especially when things were not going their way, didn't happen this time and India persisted to turn things around.\n\nIt's clear that the players and Harendra have worked on this issue. Sure, tougher tests will come and teams like China and Japan came to Bihar without their regular set of internationals. Nonetheless, India delivered when it mattered, and the title will go a big way in boosting the confidence of the players.\n\nSunelita Toppo, a world class midfielder in the making\n\nThere are players who will take the plaudits after the title. Deepika deserves credit for scoring 11 goals in the tournament. Sangita Kumari and Preeti Dubey contributed with key field goals while captain Salima Tete was outstanding when she had the ball. The most impressive Indian player in the tournament, however, was 17-year-old Sunelita.\n\nPlaying alongside her captain as a support to the forwards, Sunelita was a livewire in the middle, with speed and control that defined the status of a world class midfielder. The prime example of her prowess was seen in the semifinal against Japan where she blazed through the defence and entered the circle from the right flank before passing to Lalremsiami who scored India's second goal to seal the match.\n\nIn all seven matches, Sunelita has shown she can hold the ball under pressure and find space to carry it forward. There's a reason why she was sold for Rs 24 lakh in the Hockey India League auction to the Delhi franchise. Harendra spoke about giving freedom to the young players, Sunelita certainly made most of it on the pitch with her performances. She might not have the goals right now but she's the kind of player this team needs the most.\n\nPenalty corner conversion still a big issue\n\nIndia earned a total of 59 penalty corner chances out of which only 11 were scored directly. Out of the 11, five came against Thailand, a match they won 13-0.\n\nDeepika, the only proper dragflick expert in the team, delivered to some extent but she didn't get much support from anybody else. It was also frustrating to see mistakes on the traps in multiple matches. Sushila Chanu, otherwise solid as a defender in the tournament, was the designated stopper but made many errors on her traps. The likes of Udita and Navneet couldn't do much from penalty corners and India's variations also didn't work for most of the tournament.\n\nIt has been an issue preceding Harendra's reign. They have been working on this since last year but with hardly any improvement. As India play better teams in the Pro League and other big tournaments, they should make it count from penalty corners.\n\nIt's one area they have been struggling at for a long time. A good opportunity will come in the Hockey India League where the players will watch and learn from their foreign teammates and coaches.\n\nIndia need more from Navneet and Sharmila\n\nNavneet Kaur and Sharmila Devi have been part of the national setup for quite some time now -- both have played under previous coaches Sjoerd Marijne and Janneke Schopman. Navneet is also the vice-captain of the team and an important forward. She did score three goals, including a crucial field goal against Japan in the group stage but compared to Deepika, Sangita and Preeti, she was underwhelming.\n\nPlaying centrally in the attacking third and also being the penalty corner expert when Deepika was not on, Navneet was guilty of missing chances. There's no doubt that she's a key player for India's future, at least till 2028. Her experience in big matches is vital but it is important that Navneet also hits the note consistently.\n\nSimilarly, Sharmila was disappointing with her attacking play. She is quick on the ball, which plays to the strengths of Harendra's style, but her decision-making needs work. She has also been guilty of losing balls during attacking transitions and failed to get on the scoresheet throughout the tournament. If there's no progress, she might be left out of India's core.",

    "raw_text": "It began with the adverts popping up for less than 20 seconds in between cricket matches and normal programming. A dark indoors, the drip of sweat, foot smashing chin, head hitting floor, man flying over men, a contorted face pushing through arms and shoulders, like a Mumbai train commuter trying to board the 8:03am CST Fast.\n\nI knew what these high-quality 'teasers' were about. Charu Sharma, fellow traveller and friend from Indian sport, had mentioned a kabaddi league in the making. Bubbling with the get-go, Charu was convinced the kabaddi league was going to be a clich\u00e9-busting barrier-breaker. Whenever I bumped into him, he was always ebullient but, with every successive appearance, more exhausted. When the teasers turned up, it was a sign that his league was a go.\n\nIn mid-2014, the other mini-IPLs - hockey, badminton, boxing, football, golf, volleyball - had scrabbled for notice. Tennis was to have two leagues and they both tanked. Kabaddi was to be yet another attempt, not so much out of the box as beyond it - a mystery container launched out into the open seas. An indigenous working-class sport - in city and village - kabaddi was way beyond the boundaries of what was considered urban cool, far removed from the gaze of the TRP-generating-ad-magnet Indian purchasing classes. But that kabaddi we knew was the blurred single-cam desultory DD version.\n\nWhat burst onto Indian TV screens on July 26, 2014 was a contact sport of speed, athleticism, physicality and simplicity. Spruced up and knocked into shape with the mirror that television holds up to everything it wants to consume. It came armed with the required bells and whistles: 18 cameras, loud bass music to punctuate the action, hollering commentators, fog machines spewing out smoke and its own language and groove. Twenty minutes per half, forty minutes per match, everything said and done in an hour. Two matches per night.\n\nWhen PKL began I was hooked. Not by its loud embroidery, but the sport itself and its sheer full-contact fearlessness. Kabaddi had been described as a \"combination of tag and wrestling\" but that description ignored the sport's dramatic, gymnastic dexterity. The ability of its best athletes to torque their bodies in and out and over trouble, leaping, flying, diving through a mass of grabbing hands and stamping legs. What was unmissable was the nonchalance of its best; there they were, country boys of all shapes and sizes (maximum weight limit: 85kg) jaws strapped and heads bandaged, plunging into the action again. Emerging from under a scrum of bodies, checking their teeth to see if all were still in place and then returning to raid in the next 45 seconds.\n\nThe first rounds of games were watched as fan, journalist, anthropologist and nit-picker. Charu would get messages during matches: The scoreline graphics are not clear. Why is the score in black numbers? White shows up better with the indoor background. (Or the other way around). The numbers are too small. Why are both teams dressed in shades of blue? It's confusing on TV. Maybe they should have different strips like they do in football. Big deal. There are now three teams (out of 12) dressed in various blues and the total auction spending has risen from Rs 4.7 crores for the first season to a total player purse of Rs 48 crore in the Season 6 auction. Kindly avoid sports marketing as a career option. In this life or the next.\n\nI still find PKL's action riveting and have tried to tune in every day of every season since - even if I can only watch the second half of the second match that night. The Hindi commentary has remained more insightful than the English. Older players always tell you more. There is no favoured team - Patna have always been strong, Gujarat were outstanding on debut - nor a favourite player. But by the end of PKL 1, I'll recognise them and their quirks and discover their backstories. Captain Rakesh, Anup, Ajay Thakur, Kashiling, Jasvir, Shabeer Bappu, Manjeet Chillar. Rahul Chaudhari -- and the foreign players pronounced in a single kabaddi breath: \"Jangkunlee\", \"Fasalatrachali\"\n\nMy father, who played kabaddi in his UP schools in the 1940s, has watched PKL with me from the first season. A sports fan plus marketing man to the core, he appreciated the telegenic modification of the rules he'd known and has caught up with the new raid lingo - clock, super, do or die. You can tell the PKL is on, when kids in my Bangalore building start to play it amongst themselves, all through their free time. Not cricket, not football, not badminton. Kabaddi. A sport they wouldn't have known about five years ago.\n\nEvery season, the PKL has kept adding dinky changes - from number of teams (from 8 to 12 in Season 5) and the zonal format to setting up a highly popular juniors event. It keeps putting more and more plates into a spin and the fans remain mesmerised because the sport itself remains exciting. (But we haven't forgotten that the women's kabaddi challenge has vanished without explanations, either then or now.)\n\nWhat cannot be denied is that the PKL has done what no other Indian sport outside cricket could do with their version of a franchise league. Give the sport a remodelled form, translate its vocabulary into English and tie everything together into a watchable, sellable, instantly accessible package. Also, I miss no chance to remind people that Shikhar Dhawan's signature thigh-slap after taking a catch is borrowed from the PKL and the corny title they gave the gesture: the thigh-five.",

    "raw_text": "A phone call to my room in Barbados: \"Edward Smith, you need to see the East coast! Meet me in the lobby at 2pm.\" It was a famous voice, warm and avuncular but unprepared for excuses, as though time was short. It was Tony Cozier, and I arrived in the lobby knowing I'd never see him properly again.\n\nThis was last May. We were commentating together for BBC Test Match Special on the series between England and West Indies. With Graeme Swann in the passenger seat, and the TMS scorer Andrew Samson and I in the back, Tony began the drive towards, I assumed, a great vantage point to survey the glory of Barbados. After three or four minutes, much earlier than I'd expected, Tony pulled up by the side of the road. \"Which way's the view, Tony?\" I wondered. \"Why - it's right there,\" he said with a huge grin, pointing at an unprepossessing rum shack. That tone of benevolent mischief never left him all day, and of course, it proved infectious. The countless millions who listened to Tony's commentaries - which began in 1965 - will know the feeling.\n\nGregarious, forgiving, epicurean, anti-puritanical: Tony's listeners knew him well. That authenticity is a common trait among great commentators: they might not talk about themselves, but they can't help being themselves.\n\n\"It is a mistake to think that modern sport created the need for commentary. Commentary invented modern sport\"\n\nWe did indeed see Barbados' rugged east coast - where Tony owned a wooden beach house - but by a most circuitous and sociable route. The stories flowed as easily as the rums punches, and by the end of that sultry afternoon, steeped in a mellow glow of nostalgia, I realised I had travelled on two journeys, impossible to disentangle: the first around an island with cricket in its blood; the second around a life, equally defined by the game we love. The place, the voice, the game: a triad that Cozier unified and invested with lasting meaning.\n\n\"We won't see his like again\" is a weary clich\u00e9. Sometimes, however, it is true. Cozier belonged to a generation of iconic cricket commentators that included Richie Benaud and Christopher Martin-Jenkins, three men who were born between 1930 and 1946 and died between 2013 and 2016. Their careers - distinct but overlapping - could not take a similar shape inside cricket today. The sport and the media have both changed unrecognisably. The foundations are no longer there to support enduring careers in that mould. By nature I am optimistic, but this piece, I fear, will leave an impression of loss more than progress.\n\nFrom the 1920s, when baseball pioneered play-by-play broadcasting on the radio, the drama and colour of sport were transmitted directly into everyday life. Sport entered the living room for the first time. Family life, consequently, had a new voice around the dinner table: the sports broadcaster, or as he was known initially, the \"announcer\".\n\nThis voice, of course, defined the game. It was the job of a solitary man, with words as his only tools, to bring to life a whole scene - the players, the ground, the crowd, the sense of event and expectation, the drama unfolding. His eyes, our ears - an intimate relationship. Over time that voice became much more than just a conveyor of information; he became a trusted confidant: the announcer (much to the surprise of the radio stations) turned into a friend, someone who seemed to share experiences with the listener, even as he described them. It is a mistake to think that modern sport created the need for commentary. Commentary invented modern sport.\n\nIn a monolithic media, where sport was always found on the same radio stations or TV channels, some voices became so deeply associated with games that it was hard to think of the sport without them. To British rugby union fans, Bill McLaren, who died in 2010, was the voice of the game. Tony, of course, was the voice of Caribbean cricket. Whenever he came on the radio, by the time he'd finished saying \"Good morning\", he had automatically initiated a complex layering of associations in the listener's mind: images and recollections of West Indian cricket in its glory days, a high point that coincided with the middle years of Tony's career. We heard a voice and saw a sporting culture in full flow.\n\nIn today's media landscape, with far greater competition and hence fragmentation, it is impossible for any voice to become so universal. Much is gained by that competition. But the next generation of cricket fans will not draw on the same shared experiences of definitive voices. There is no single voice of cricket today, nor can there be one.\n\nTony came from a particular cricketing culture, which he knew intimately and could explain to the rest of the world. He was not incidentally West Indian; his identity was central to his whole working life. (It did not, however, prevent him being outspoken and courageous, especially in his later years.) Again, in this respect Tony belonged to a particular generation. International cricket, for the majority of Tony's career, was the truly glamorous spectacle, the game's gold standard.\n\n\"In some respects, the game is more cosmopolitan now. But the old sense of distinct national blocks within a cricketing culture - each with one explainer-in-chief - has long gone\"\n\nIn the era of the IPL and franchise cricket, in which the players and the media are drawn from around the world, jumbled up across every team, the new cricketing landscape is very different. In some respects, the game is more cosmopolitan now. But the old sense of distinct national blocks within a cricketing culture - each with one explainer-in-chief - has long gone. The players do not belong to their countries in quite the same way today. In that transition, the ownership of the distinctly national commentator has also waned. Who knows Chris Gayle's game the best: a West Indian commentator/fan or an IPL commentator/fan?\n\nFinally, Tony's career began in a different culture of player-media relations, defined by trust rather than suspicion. On those long tours in the 1960s and 1970s, so much was shared between fellow travellers that trust was built into the game. It is also revealing, as with Martin-Jenkins, that Tony's broadcasting never suffered from the fact that he hadn't been a top player. Perhaps it sustained his passion.\n\nI was once shown a study that explored different branches of the media and how people felt about them. Which word did people associate with the radio? The answer was \"friend\". Though Tony was also a prolific television broadcaster, it was the radio that gave primacy to his greatest asset: his voice, the voice of a friend.",

Axelsen is pretty much the gold standard in the current era of men's singles. He has won singles medals at the last two Olympics, and also won the World Championships in Tokyo in 2022.\n\nThe Dane also presents Lakshya his toughest test in what has already been a tough campaign so far. He had to get past the third seed Jonatan Christie in the group stage and then two higher-ranked players in HS Prannoy and Chou Tien Chen in the first two knockout rounds.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES: LAKSHYA VS AXELSEN\n\nThe rest day will help the 22-year-old before the semifinal, especially after coming through three matches in three days, the last of which was incredibly intense from a physical perspective. Even though, he is India's fittest player in the men's singles, the break to recharge his batteries couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nINDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS 2024 - AUGUST 4 FULL SCHEDULE\n\nBefore the semifinal, for those Indian fans of the superstitious kind, there is a good sign for Lakshya already. The last two players to beat Chou Tien Chen in an Olympic quarterfinal -- Lee Chong Wei in Rio and Chen Long in Tokyo -- also went on to make the final.\n\nAdditionally, the last time an Indian faced Axelsen in a marquee event, HS Prannoy won in the World Championship quarterfinal in the Dane's own backyard in Copenhagen.\n\nLakshya Sen vs Viktor Axelsen head-to-head\n\nAxelsen leads 7-1, and most of his wins over Lakshya have been comfortable. However, the two met earlier this year in the first round of the Singapore Open, and it was a tight contest where Axelsen eventually prevailed in three games.\n\nThat performance was one of those which marked Lakshya's turnaround in form in 2024 as not just a flash in the pan, but one that would enable him to make a mark in Paris.\n\nThe Indian's only win against Axelsen came in the 2022 German Open in a nail-biter, winning the third game 22-20. It was two years ago but it should give the Indian the confidence that Axelsen is not an insurmountable hurdle.\n\nAnother piece of good news for Lakshya is that in 2024, Axelsen hasn't looked quite as invincible as he has at some times in the past. He's lost early at some major tournaments, has had injury concerns and been beaten by some unexpected players like Toma Junior Popov, Wang Tzu Wei and Chou Tien Chen, like who Lakshya beat in the quarters.\n\nWhat are Axelsen's strengths?\n\nIn short, everything that a singles player needs to good at. But when you delve deeper into Axelsen's game, the one attribute that makes him a scary opponent for anyone facing him is his excellent shot-making.\n\nAxelsen is adept at both fast exchanges at the net, drop shots and also the big smash from deeper in the court. This ability to vary his speed comes from being able to read an opponent and change tactics almost at will.\n\nAxelsen's natural game has an answer to both defensive and aggressive players. For defensive players, his variety of shot-making often proves to be too much to handle. Against more aggressive players, the Dane's massive wing-span makes him an excellent retriever of shuttles as well.\n\nGenerally, Axelsen does prefer to have his shot-making come to the fore and help him dictate rallies rather than having to defend and just trying to stay in rallies.\n\nHow can Lakshya nullify those strengths?\n\nRepeat everything he did against Chou Tien Chen. Do it for the duration of the whole game. No room for errors. Lakshya can't afford to give Axelsen a sniff of momentum.\n\nHe is equipped to do it, no doubt. He is one of the best defensive players in the world. His ability to make diving retrievals and then spring up to be in position to play the next shuttle as well is something that he will need against Axelsen.\n\nHowever, the mix of defence and attack that Lakshya showed against Chou is the template. He cannot afford to be passive. The big crosscourt smashes from left to right really worked nicely for Lakshya in his quarterfinal, and that has got to be an attacking weapon for him.\n\nA win against Axelsen will be the greatest win by an Indian man at the Olympics. It will be tough. But Lakshya Sen almost didn't even qualify for Paris after a month-long poor run of form. He had a turnaround of form just in time to even make it here. And after making it, he's only crossed one tough obstacle after another. Now, the big Dane presents the biggest one of them all. History awaits Lakshya Sen on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe match will start at around 3:30 PM IST on Sunday.",

    "raw_text": "Lights, camera, a(u)ction - India's best men's kabaddi players will be in the spotlight over the next two days as the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) player auctions get underway in Mumbai on August 15 and 16. Each of the 12 franchises has a purse of \u20b95 crore as they bid to form their squads ahead of PKL 11.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the PKL 11 player auctions:\n\nWho are the big players going into the auction?\n\nSome of PKL's greatest players ever are up for grabs in the auctions this time. For starters, Pawan Sehrawat - who is PKL's most expensive player of all time and was PKL 10's third-best raider - is in the auction, as is Iranian showman Mohammadreza Shadloui. The all-rounder became PKL's most expensive foreign signing last season and played a pivotal role in Puneri Paltan's title victory.\n\nThen there's PKL's Mr Consistent Maninder Singh, who was the fourth-best raider and Iranian defender Fazel Atachali, who is the league's most successful captain ever. A couple of other big names include Pardeep Narwal (who remains a big name despite his underwhelming performance last season) and Sachin Tanwar (Patna Pirates' #1 raider in PKL 10).\n\nCan we expect some big, record-breaking bids again?\n\nYou bet. With so many big names in the auction, records are meant to be broken. Telugu Titans splurged \u20b92.65 crore last season for Pawan, while Puneri Paltan spent \u20b92.31 crore for Shadlou and Bengal Warriors used their FBM Card to retain Maninder Singh for Rs. \u20b92.12 crore.\n\nExpect all of those records to be broken this time and don't be surprised if you see Shadlou attract the highest bid, especially after how good he was last time around (he was the season's best defender and had the most tackle points and High 5s.)\n\nPlus, as last season, each of the 12 franchises has a total salary purse of \u20b95 crore, so some big-money moves are a definite possibility.\n\nWait, what's an FBM Card?\n\nThat's an important one: a Final Bid Match [FBM] card allows the team to buy back their players, who they had earlier released, for the price of the final bid at the auction. Each team has three FBM cards, but that depends on the number of players they released before the auction. If a team has retained their maximum quota of six players, then they can use the card FBM only once. However, they can use the card up to three times if they have retained five or fewer players.\n\nFor example, the Bengal Warriors have released Maninder. Let's say Tamil Thalaivas make a winning bid of \u20b92 crore during the auction. At this point, the auctioneer will ask the Bengal Warriors if they want to use their FBM card to retain Maninder. If the Warriors say yes, then Maninder will remain with the Warriors for \u20b92 crore (the winning bid amount). If the Warriors say no to using the FBM card, then Tamil Thalaivas will have added Maninder to their squad.\n\nHow does the PKL auction work?\n\nIt's simple: The domestic and foreign players will be divided into four categories: A, B, C and D. The players will be further subdivided as 'All-Rounders', 'Defenders' and 'Raiders' within each category. The base prices for each of the categories are Category A - \u20b930 Lakh, Category B - \u20b920 Lakh, Category C - \u20b913 Lakh and Category D - \u20b99 Lakh. Over 500 players will be part of the auction pool, including the 24 players from the two finalist teams of the Khelo India University Games 2024.\n\nWhat do the teams look like before the auction?\n\nPuneri Paltan, the defending champions, look solid. They have retained their star raiding trio of Aslam Inamdar, Mohit Goyat and Pankaj Mohite as well as the defensive duo of Abinesh Nadarajan and Gaurav Khatri as they look to become only the second team to retain their title.\n\nFormer champions Dabang Delhi have held onto their captain Naveen Kumar and mercurial raider Ashu Malik, while two-time champions Jaipur Pink Panthers have retained their MVP Arjun Deshwal.\n\nTeams such as Bengal Warriors, UP Yoddhas and Telugu Titans will be looking for a complete overhaul.\n\nWhat are the most expensive signings in PKL history?\n\nPawan Kumar Sehrawat is the most expensive player in PKL history. He was signed by Telugu Titans for \u20b92.605 crore in PKL 10. The top 5 most expensive signings in PKL history are:",

The Iranian also has another record to his name - he had the most High 5s in 10 seasons - 11.\n\n276\n\nDabang Delhi's Ashu Malik and Jaipur Pink Panthers' Arjun Deshwal are locked on 276 raid points at the end of the season. This poses a unique situation for the organizers - every season's best raider is awarded a Green Sleeve. Who do they give it to this time? Do they get half a sleeve each? This was surely not a part of anyone's PKL 10 bingo card. Intriguing.\n\n1000\n\nA historic milestone for PKL as it became only the second sporting league in India to go past 1000 matches. The 1000th game was won by PKL's most consistent raider Maninder Singh's Bengal Warriors' while the 10001st game marked the dawn of a new era and Jaipur Pink Panthers emerged victorious in that one.\n\n1690\n\nPardeep Narwal had a poor campaign by his standards, but that did not stop him from etching another milestone to his name. The Dubki King, who seems to have lost his sheen on the mat, became the first raider in PKL history to cross 1600 raid points. He also finished with 85 Super 10s, which also, is yet another PKL record.\n\n\u20b91,28,690\n\nTelugu Titans broke the bank to sign Asian Games gold medal-winning captain Pawan Sehrawat for a whopping \u20b92.605 Cr and made him the most expensive PKL player by a massive margin. Pawan finished with 202 raid points, - which amounts to ~ \u20b91.3 lakh per raid point, but that did not stop Telugu Titans from finishing at the bottom of the table for the third consecutive season.",

Remarkably, Lakshya is unseeded in this loaded men's singles draw and was a late entrant in the Race to Paris.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nBut on the faster courts of Paris, rankings and Chou's better head-to-head (3-1) didn't matter. Just like against third seed Jonatan Christie two days back. Just like he did at the Thomas Cup and Asian Games team final, when he won World Championship bronze, when he went on his two All England Championship runs.\n\nIn the end, Lakshya's superior physical fitness coupled with newly rediscovered self-belief were the biggest assets in a match that lasted 75 minutes. He had the power-packed winners to end the shorter points, the dogged defence to stay in the longer ones and the versatility to oscillate between the two, which proved to a combination too strong for the 34-year-old from Chinese Taipei.\n\nDespite the 12-year age gap between the opponents, the quarterfinal was an intensely physical battle with both players engaging in longer rallies and staying solid in defence to start with and then switching to more proactive play.\n\nIt required creative thinking and shot making to win the initial rallies and it was Chou who had the two-point advantage at the mid-game interval after putting Lakshya in uncomfortable positions: not an easy task.\n\nThe points got shorter in the second half as both sped up things, which opened up more chances to win points. This is when Lakshya, guided by childhood coaches Prakash Padukone and Vimal Kumar in Paris, got tactical with his shot placement to draw level at 15-15 and then 19-19. But at the toughest point of any badminton match, Lakshya was outpaced by the veteran.\n\nThe second game, starting from the faster side of the court, saw Lakshya zoom to a lead and get niftier with his shots - display a facet of new, improved net play. There was a moment of distraction as Lakshya had words with chair umpire and supervisor after an unsuccessful challenge on the back court which was not shown on the big screen.\n\nThis was the kind of that would have derailed his momentum just a few months back, but he didn't let anything faze him as he took a slender 1-point lead at the mid-game interval and then forced a decider with sheer pace of play.\n\nThere was variation in his strokes and the wonderful exchanges at the net as the Indian sets up game 6 game points, picking up speed from the faster end.\n\nAt the start of the decider, Chou was seen taking deep breaths on the sidelines with his eyes closed as the speed of the action seemed to catch up with the 34-year-old.\n\nThe Indian was crafty with his strokes and excellent on defence, with low pick-ups and corner-to-corner defending all over court which ensured that at no point did Chou had a breather.\n\nLakshya headed into the mid game interval of the decider (and the good side of the court), with a lead of 11-7 and just when Chou's legs were fading, Lakshya was still raring to go. He then clinched it with a smashing cross court winner and after an hour and 15 minutes of play.\n\nThere was a lovely moment at the net as he seemed to cheer up Chou and a muted reaction to the win. He knows the enormity of the task still ahead of him. \"There's more work to do now, the real test starts. Time to go back recover and be ready for the next match,\" he said after the match.\n\nUp next could be either defending Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen - the toughest man to beat in men's badminton today - or former world champion Loh Kean Yew. Neither easy at the biggest stage, but when has that stopped Lakshya, the star of a Thomas Cup-winning Indian team.\n\nLakshya, the last Indian standing in the badminton arena, has all the reasons to believe he can beat anyone on his day. And these last few days have all been his at Paris 2024.",

    "raw_text": "When the idea was presented, in the early 2010s, to bring kabaddi -- a traditional, largely rural, sport -- to air-conditioned stadiums in urban cities and showcase it with jazzy television-friendly graphics, it did not have many takers. The IPL was at the time India's only successful, mainstream league, and completely dominated the country's sporting landscape.\n\nToday, it's fair to say that the Pro Kabaddi League has revolutionised the sport of kabaddi, transforming it -- thanks in part to tweaked, TV-friendly rules -- into a modern sport for a modern audience. The players, who had been sceptical about its viability when told of the early plans, were convinced only after they were featured in photoshoots and promotional video campaigns. Their successors have been made into superhero figures, with one even nicknamed Baahubali.\n\nThe growth has been in every facet:\n\nThe league itself has grown from eight teams to 12 -- the entry of new teams an endorsement of the PKL's popularity, with investors willing to bet on it.\n\nToday's players are earning multiples of the early-season paycheques. Rakesh Kumar was PKL 1's most expensive player, earning Rs 12.8 lakh; current India captain Pawan Kumar Sehrawat was signed by Telugu Titans this year for Rs 2.6 crore -- more than 20 times the value.\n\nPKL is also now a magnet for international stars, attracting players from 12 countries. It's a bit of a double-edged sword: the PKL was also indirectly credited for Iran's upset of India at the 2018 Asian Games.\n\nIn viewership terms Star Sports Network*, the league's official broadcaster, says the current season has clocked 226 million viewers in the first 90 matches - a 17% increase in reach compared to Season 9. In fact Season 10 has already surpassed last year's viewership figures, with the playoffs and finals yet to be played.\n\nAll this, and more -- fan engagement, for example, as is evident if you watch a match at the stadium -- makes the PKL comfortably India's second-most-watched sporting league. It's grown, on several parameters, from strength to strength. But what's next? How can the PKL sustain this success -- and expand even more?\n\nFilm producer Ronnie Screwvala, one of the league's original backers and owner of former champions U Mumba, believes it still has a lot of potential to grow. \"I would say that the initial growth was certainly exponential and as a team owner we broke even pretty much straight away. I do think, though, there could have and should have been substantial growth thereafter as well with the second round of media rights with more than 330 million people tuning in and kabaddi firmly becoming India's second sport.\"\n\nHe was referring to the auction of PKL's media rights in 2021, where Star India* retained the media rights for Rs 905 crore for a 5-year period. That fee translated to Rs 181 crore per season, reportedly double of what the earlier annual media rights fee was. However, Screwvala feels more can be done to unlock PKL's true potential.\n\n\"We're yet to unlock the full potential and value of the sport and we need pushes in the right direction, whether it be media rights, sponsorships or the overall growth of sport in an organized manner too,\" he says. \"With the media rights of the Women's Premier League being Rs 950 crores in year one, given the substantially larger audience of PKL now in its 10th season, we should hopefully generate the growth that PKL deserves over the next 5-6 years.\"\n\nThat bullish forecast is what encouraged Capri Sports, part of the financial advisory firm Capri Global, to take over the Bengal Warriors franchise in 2023. Apurv Gupta, Capri Global's head of contact sports, says their decision to join the PKL fold was driven by the league's success on multiple fronts.\n\n\"When you're entering into Indian sports and you're looking to grow a business, any entrepreneur, any businessman, any business house would look at kabaddi because it has sustained itself so beautifully over the last 10 years. In terms of viewership, player profiles, player salaries and the sustaining of the league through the bio-bubble -- all the angles of the sport have grown.\"\n\nPreventing a plateau\n\nThe PKL was initially driven by the league and its owner broadcasters. The feeling is that, going forward, the growth will need to be franchise-driven, player-association-driven. The conversation is easier now for the league, with many franchise owners involved across sport (like JSW with Haryana Steelers in the PKL, Bengaluru FC in the ISL and Delhi Capitals in the IPL), but it remains a challenging one.\n\nSuhail Chandhok, CEO of U Mumba, feels an \"active role is needed from everyone involved to ensure we aren't sitting back and expecting the sport to grow itself over the next crucial phase.\"\n\n\"It's about [franchises] creating their true brand value,\" says Nic Coward, an expert advisor to the PKL who has also worked on top global sports events such as the Premier League. \"It should be an asset growth story. Ultimately, these are owners of a franchise in a league who are building that value. And I still think sometimes that there's a great disparity between the franchises. Some absolutely understand, not least because they have a portfolio perhaps now of different properties (like a JSW).\"\n\nThe league, then, has to treat franchises as different and unique. \"And you want this because you want a difference in your league.\" He takes the example of Puneri Paltan, who revisited the idea of what their franchise should be early on. They felt there was a lack of players in India and the only way to address that issue was by setting up an academy to create a pathway and have homegrown players make up their team.\n\nAcademies -- as a reliable and consistent feeder system for the teams -- are crucial for the growth of any league. As of now, only three teams have academies: Puneri Paltan, UP Yoddhas and Tamil Thalaivas, with a majority of the players in the league coming from private academies run by PKL coaches or from the numerous Sports Authority of India centres. However, for a bigger pool of players, it would largely benefit teams all across if they can set up a feeder system to unearth the next-gen of kabaddi stars.\n\nKailash Kandpal, CEO of Puneri Paltan, says the team took inspiration from football clubs and cricket leagues. \"We saw that the sport was picking up, but there was a shortage of players in the pipeline. So, we decided to develop talent from the grassroots and get a new supply of players for our team's sustenance.\"\n\nTheir idea was to recruit players between the ages of 16 and 17 so that by the time they joined the PKL-fold around the age of 20, they would have reached the peak performance point of their careers.\n\n\"We have players from across the length and breadth of the country. It's not that we only have players from Maharashtra because we're Puneri Paltan, we have boys from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Haryana and Punjab as well. And we have shown them that there is something for all of them here, they can make it to the A team if they do well.\"\n\nIt's also something that the PKL's Mr. Consistent Maninder Singh -- the only current player to have played in the inaugural season -- would like to see going forward: more teams paying attention to the grassroots. \"A few teams have academies and that has helped them prepare players before they join PKL, which adds stability. Like in football, clubs have players from the U14 level who then grow into the senior team. It would be great if we had a similar system in kabaddi too.\"\n\nAlso, says Chandhok, it's important to have an ecosystem for the players during the non-PKL months.\n\nHe says, \"I think player education is a big element that could come in to ensure that the athletes remain professionals for the nine months of the year that players aren't playing the PKL. I also think that the ecosystem itself needs to grow as a whole by welcoming new stakeholders that want to take the sport to new parts and grow it, whether that be in India, or at the grassroots level in an organised manner or to take the sport globally and send coaches from India abroad to bring new nations to the sport.\"\n\nThere is only one initiative so far that has sought to bridge the gap -- the Yuva Kabaddi Series [YKS]. Launched in 2022 by Suhail Chandhok and Arvind Sivdas, the YKS is played thrice each year and caters solely to players below the age of 23. The idea behind establishing the YKS was to provide a professional platform for junior players and also double up as a feeder system.\n\nEach match is streamed online, giving young players an avenue to showcase their skills and attract opportunities to play for PKL teams, which are otherwise largely limited to trials. A leading example is Sudhakar M, whose stellar showing in the YKS earned him a call from three-time champions Patna Pirates this season.\n\nMore rule changes\n\nThere's also room for more technological innovation -- those rule tweaks were crucial to kickstart the league and, 10 years down the line, there are more being planned.\n\nE Prasad Rao, the PKL's technical director fondly known as \"Kabaddi Rao\", explains. \"We are still making changes to the rules. On day 1 we got a mud sport to the mat and changed small rules and now we are getting into complicated rules, like the lobby rule. I tell all the international kabaddi bodies - the PKL is the biggest laboratory where we can do experiments. Like the lobby rule, for example, we changed it and now, after the Asian Games, everyone sees why we made the change.\"\n\nHe adds, \"We're trying to inculcate a way where if a player is tagged, then like the bails in cricket, something should be lit up. Or if someone crosses the line, then there should be a light to signify that.\"\n\nThe League is also open to amending the game's format, with PKL commissioner Anupam Goswami saying they're mulling over the idea of introducing the tiebreaker rule in the league stage. As per the current rules, teams get three points each if they are engaged in a tied contest. \"One exciting prospect under consideration is the extension of the tiebreaker format, currently reserved for the playoffs, into the league stages of the tournament. This strategic initiative could transform each match into a decisive contest with a clear win or loss outcome for the competing teams,\" he says.\n\nIt's also a fact that the PKL has so far not tapped into the women's sport; all the growth has been limited to the men's game; there's now a realisation that it's time to change that and bring India's women kabaddi players -- who have been successful in international competition -- into the system.\n\nThe PKL did in fact stage a women's tournament in 2016, a three-team exhibition event called the Women's Kabaddi Challenge. It never returned, however.\n\nNow, franchise owners such as Abhishek Bachchan, who owns reigning PKL champions Jaipur Pink Panthers, have openly expressed their interest in hosting a women's PKL. The League's organisers said in March 2023 that they were exploring the possibility of a women's tournament, but that has so far only remained a statement.\n\nThe PKL is now in a position of strength and with that comes the responsibility to ensure the overall growth of the sport. A women's tournament would reflect the PKL's 360-degree vision. Leave the last word with Prasad Rao: \"Now if you say \"kabaddi\" people don't know...but they all know 'Pro Kabaddi'. That's an incredible achievement for a sport -- and, though its future is in uncharted territory, the track record suggests its growth is a given.\n\n** ESPN.in and the Star Sports Network are owned by the Walt Disney Company.",

    "raw_text": "\"India yahan itihaas banane jaa rha hain (India is going to make history here).\" That's what Devendra Jhajharia, the first Indian para-athlete ever to win two Paralympics gold medals, and now the President of the Paralympic Committee of India, told ESPN on August 27 - a day before the Paris Paralympics began.\n\nEVERY MEDAL WON BY INDIA AT THE PARALYMPICS | PARIS PARALYMPICS MEDAL TALLY\n\nJhajharia's claims (in public) that \"India would win at least 25 medals\" raised eyebrows, India won 19 medals in Tokyo, but wasn't 25 too steep a figure? Ten days later, India closed out their Paralympics campaign with a record 29 medals. That's one medal less than the 30 medals India have won across all Games since their debut at the Paralympics in 1968. Jhajharia now stands validated, India had gone four medals past his optimistic prediction.\n\nTo truly understand the magnitude of this success, you have to compare it to Jhajharia's Paralympic debut two decades ago. Back in 2004, he funded himself and when he came back a gold medallist from the Athens Paralympics, \"no one even garlanded me\". Cut to today, India's para-athletes came back to dhols and garlands and formal receptions from the powers that be, much like the Olympians.\n\n\"Din raat ka difference hai (there's a massive difference),\" Jhajharia says while talking about para-sports in India today.\n\nBut what exactly happened in these intervening years?\n\nThe Rio revolution\n\nA major catalyst for change was the 2016 Rio Paralympics. The four medals in Rio were India's best tally in 32 years and para-athletes won two more medals than their able-bodied compatriots did at the 2016 Olympics. Largely ignored till then, the performance in Rio made the nation wake up and take notice of para-sports.\n\nJhajharia, Mariyappan Thangavelu, Deepa Malik and Varun Bhati became household names, were featured on primetime television slots and their stories inspired many. Their success attracted big cheques as Jhajharia was awarded upwards of \u20b91 crore and land from the central and state governments. Malik received \u20b94 crore from the Haryana government. Their examples served as inspiration -- those who thought there was no future in para sports now saw a purpose, that they too had a shot at recognition, cash awards and a chance at a better life. Like Nithya Sre Sivan, who watched the 2016 Paralympics on TV as an 11-year-old and realized she could have a future in para-badminton. Cut to 2024, she's won bronze at the Paralympics (women's singles SH6).\n\nThe impact of TOPS and Khelo India\n\nFifty-two of India's 84 para-athletes - 62% - in Paris were sponsored by TOPS, and that's proved key to their success. The likes of Sumit Antil (javelin F64 gold in Tokyo and Paris) and Sharad Kumar (high jump T63 bronze in Tokyo and silver in Paris) were included in India's elite sporting program, the Target Podium Olympic Scheme (TOPS), in 2019.\n\nWith TOPS came unprecedented support: core group athletes got help to train abroad, procure equipment, compete in international events and were eligible for a monthly stipend of \u20b950,000.\n\nThe impact can be seen with everyone in the scheme. Take Nishad Kumar -- the high jumper lost his right hand when he was seven and a half years old while working on the farm, and it was a struggle financially when growing up. He recalls that there was a time when his family didn't have money to buy essentials like salt, but all of that changed after he was inducted into TOPS.\n\nBut it's not just one scheme. Para-shooter Mona Agarwal, who won bronze in Paris, benefitted from the monthly \u20b910,000 stipend she gets from the Khelo India scheme that came about in 2023 after the inaugural edition of the Khelo India Para Games.\n\nThe results of this support were almost immediate: India had a record-breaking 19 medallists at the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics and two years later a staggering 111 medals at the 2023 Para Asian Games. This was, of course, in addition to Indian para-athletes winning medals in the World Championships of their respective sports: Sumit's golds in 2023 and 2024, Deepthi Jeevanji's gold in 2024, Sheetal Devi's silver in 2023.\n\nThe Army Paralympic Node\n\nIn 2017, the establishment of the Army Paralympic Node (APN) helped tap into a big resource. Lieutenant Colonel Gaurav Dutta, India's first para-athlete to run a triathlon, was the Officer-In-Charge of the project and was eager to create an ecosystem for army men who suffered accidents in the line of duty.\n\n\"The Army Paralympic Node was established to give the war-disabled soldiers the satisfaction that they can still contribute meaningfully to the nation and the army. It gave them a new purpose in life. Sports also play a very important role in holistic rehabilitation of a person, especially when the disability is an acquired one,\" says Dutta, currently the joint secretary of the Karnataka Rowing Federation.\n\nFrom one army representative at the 2016 and 2021 Paralympics in para-athletics, India had four army men competing in Paris across three para sports: athletics, rowing and shooting. Amongst them was bronze medallist Hokato Hotozhe Sema. He lost his leg during a landmine blast in 2002 and it was a chance meeting with Dutta around 2016 that inspired him to take up shot put. The APN came up a year later and served as a perfect training platform for him.\n\n\"This completely changed the perspective of people around them, to include their families, fellow soldiers and society,\" Dutta says on the impact of the APN.\n\nPrivate bodies join the revolution\n\nSupport from private bodies such as the GoSports Foundation have also contributed to the growth of para-sports. GoSports were among the frontrunners in this cause, launching the Para Champions Programme back in 2015.\n\nSumit, the only Indian track and field athlete to defend his gold across the Paralympics and Olympics, credits his success to them. \"GoSports were there for me when I had no one. In 2019 when I got support for the first time, it was from GoSports. If they hadn't supported me then, maybe my journey here might not have been possible.\" In fact, GoSports had helped Sumit get his first prosthetic leg.\n\nGoSports supported 16 para-athletes at the Paris Olympics, while Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ) supported the likes of Avani Lekhara (first Indian woman to win and defend her Paralympic gold), Nishad Kumar (two-time Paralympic silver medallist) and Ajeet Singh (silver in Paris). OGQ began backing para-athletes in October 2019 and have supported para-athletes in multiple ways: they've supported Avani Lekhara with her personalised wheelchair and rifle, helped Ajeet with a prosthetic limb and a javelin and fully oversaw Simran Sharma's journey from an injury in 2023 to a bronze at the Paris Paralympics.\n\nAmong OGQ's biggest success stories is Sheetal Devi, the world's first armless archer. They scouted her in 2022 and have assisted her with equipment, coaching, sports science and travel costs for tournaments. Since then, Sheetal won gold at the Asian Para Games, became the world #1 in the women's compound and won a bronze in the mixed event at the Paralympics.\n\nWhat does the way forward look like?\n\nThere's a lot of good work being done: the government has given para-athletes equal cash awards as their able-bodies counterparts (\u20b975 lakh for gold medallists, \u20b950 lakh for the silver medallists, \u20b930 lakh for bronze winners and \u20b922.5 lakh for mixed team medallists) and spent an estimate of \u20b974 crore between the Tokyo and Paris Paralympics, which was over twice of the spendings for the Tokyo Games.\n\nBut India's para-athletes need to be backed all throughout, not only when they win. After his bronze medal triumph, Hokato Sema would dedicate his medal to his wife, saying she \"often starved so that I could eat and continue training because we didn't have enough money to ensure two square meals a day. She has picked me up every time I felt like giving up.\" The Nagaland government immediately announced a \u20b91.5 crore cash reward for him and said it would recommend his name for the Arjuna Award and promotion in the Indian Army, but if this support had maybe come in earlier, he may not have had to endure those difficult times.\n\nSponsorships aside, a lot more needs to be done to improve the state of affairs. For starters, make para-sports more popular and stadiums accessible for athletes. \"I aim to have accessible sporting stadiums in 600 districts across the length and breadth of the country to tap into the grassroots. I have approached numerous state governments to ensure their stadiums have ramps, are accessible via wheelchair and have accessible toilets. These are the basics to improve para-sports,\" says Jhajharia.\n\nAnother requirement is a dedicated centre of excellence that will solely cater to para-athletes. \"The main ask now is to have a National Paralympic Training Centre in a location where the weather is suitable for training all year. Along with that, a Talent Identification and Development Plan would help us unearth new talent,\" says Dutta. The Sports Authority of India has already announced committees for five para-sports, but these committees \"need to be functional and budgeted, not merely on paper,\" he adds.\n\nA major task for Jhajharia will be to get the PCI administration in order. Who can forget how the erstwhile administration changed the venue of the 2021 National Para Athletics Championship days mere days before the event, how the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru was not wheelchair friendly and the shot put event was held amidst torches and car headlights...all this at an event that was a qualifier for the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics. While Jhajharia will need to fix that, the PCI is also looking to host a major international event next year to further spread awareness. ESPN understands that India is keen to host the World Para Athletics Championships in the second half of 2025.\n\nAs gold medalist Nitesh Kumar tweeted, there are big issues that currently fall outside the PCI's ambit as well: \"Irrespective of the social media appreciation from [Badminton Association of India] (which is very rare),we the athletes are highly dissatisfied with the response & the interest from BAI regarding Para badminton responsibilities, we sincerely request BAI & [Sports Authority of India] to handover para badminton to PCI.\"\n\nIndia's para-athletes have shown that the sky is truly the limit. With proper support and backing, from the government and corporates alike, India could very well become one of the most dominant forces in global para-sports.",

    "raw_text": "\"Chalo kuch gup-shup karte hain.\" [Come, let us chit-chat.]\n\nWith that one line, uttered after he had finished his first press conference as BCCI president, Anurag Thakur walked away from decades of well-established board culture that had treated the media with distrust and as outsiders.\n\nWhen a journalist handed him a paper cup of tea, Thakur wondered why no one else had been served. Over the next half hour, he spoke patiently and as openly as he could, without letting out too many secrets.\n\nBefore the chat, Thakur had spoken as if he was a politician at a rally, not a BCCI president. He detailed the numerous social welfare initiatives the board planned to invest in. He did not play the defensive hand. Each time he was asked about the Lodha Committee, he reiterated his point of view that some of the recommendations would tear apart the fabric of the BCCI and damage the interests of the players as well.\n\nIn Indian political circles, Thakur's has been a well-known name and face. On Sunday he was unanimously elected BCCI president, one of the most powerful positions - some would argue the most powerful - in world cricket. The BCCI has only had one president younger than Thakur - Fatehsingh Rao Gaekwad was 33 when he led from 1963 to '66.\n\nThakur's climb to the top of the BCCI might appear unusually swift, but he has always been ambitious. He captained Punjab and North Zone at the age-group levels, and also played a first-class match for his native Himachal Pradesh in the 2000-01 Ranji Trophy season. Thakur reportedly played that match only because he wanted to become a junior national selector. The BCCI administration at the time, under the leadership of Jagmohan Dalmiya, had made it mandatory for selectors to have first-class cricket experience. Thakur made a seven-ball duck in Himachal's only innings, and picked up two wickets in the nine overs he bowled.\n\nIn the same year he became the youngest ever president of a state association, when he took the reins of the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association at 26. The jury might be out on his cricketing talent, but there is no doubting his clout as an administrator. According to seasoned BCCI officials, Thakur worked hard to turn a \"backward state\" like Himachal around, and establish one of the most impressive venues on the world cricket map. Thakur created modern cricket facilities not just in picturesque Dharamsala but also in smaller towns like Bilaspur and Una.\n\n\"I inherited only seven chairs, one iron cupboard and a typewriter,\" he said of those early days. \"But within five years, we built an international stadium in Dharamsala - not only a cricket stadium but one of the most beautiful cricket stadiums in the world, and also built around five-six other stadiums in the state.\"\n\nPeople who have observed Thakur's progress are not surprised. \"He has age and experience, a unique combination, in his favour. He has a contemporary perspective,\" a BCCI official says. \"If you look at his development projects in Himachal, that is the classic example of what he has done for cricket. Because he knows what the cricket requirements are at the state level, he has been hands-on as an administrator, which is a big advantage.\"\n\nA senior East Zone official described Thakur's rise as \"tremendous\", from the time he began attending BCCI meetings around 2004. This official had no doubt that being a politician has helped Thakur immensely. According to him Thakur's biggest punt, which played a crucial role in his swift rise to the top rung of the BCCI, was his decision to run for the post of secretary during the acrimonious 2015 BCCI elections.\n\nThakur became a BCCI office-bearer for the first time in 2011, when he was elected joint secretary in the N Srinivasan administration. Srinivasan's not stepping down during the 2013 IPL corruption scandal did not sit well with Thakur, who was one of the few BCCI officials unafraid to express his grievances in public at the time, when he said institutions were bigger than individuals.\n\n\"He was just a joint secretary, which is not anything big in the BCCI,\" the East Zone official said. \"But he showed the guts to stand for the secretary's position two years back, which changed things. That he could do that was only because he was a politician. No one else could have dared.\"\n\nThakur won the secretary's post by a single vote when he defeated the incumbent, Sanjay Patel, in the elections in Chennai, where Jagmohan Dalmiya returned for his second stint as BCCI president. Srinivasan, the East Zone official who was present during the 2015 election said, had in fact approached Thakur and offered to support his nomination for the president's post. \"By the time Thakur arrived, he had decided to be part of the Dalmiya camp,\" the East Zone official said. \"When Srinivasan offered him the president's post, Thakur did not ditch the Dalmiya camp.\"\n\nThakur was perhaps aware that he had more to gain if he was loyal to the men he had originally teamed up with to defeat Srinivasan's lobby. \"He is the face of the next generation,\" the official said. \"For the last 20 years BCCI has had presidents who have come from the old school of administration.\"\n\nAs a politician, Thakur knows the importance of reaching out to people who matter. A BCCI vice-president said he received a call from Thakur a couple of weeks ago, when he expressed his desire to run for the board presidency. \"He is a man of few words,\" the vice-president said. \"He is a straightforward guy. He likes to interact with people like us. He might be younger to me, but there is a chemistry between him and the young people in the board. Normally in the BCCI, people are very reluctant to open up because they don't want to antagonise somebody. But Anurag is open and makes his opinion very clear - whether somebody likes it or not, he is not worried about.\"\n\nVeterans and young board members alike say Thakur's biggest strength is his proximity to influential people. Power and positioning are the planks on which he has raised his solid platform. Thakur has been on the right side of both the government and the power brokers within the BCCI.\n\nThakur is capable of taking independent positions on issues, but as president he will need the support of his key lieutenant. He and secretary, Ajay Shirke, whom Thakur nominated on Sunday, have grown close during these difficult times for the BCCI in the Supreme Court. Shirke was the treasurer when the IPL corruption scandal broke in 2013. He, along with the secretary at the time Sanjay Jagdale, stepped down from their positions in protest against Srinivasan.\n\n\"Ajay Shirke has been his biggest advisor,\" a Thakur critic within the BCCI said. \"Shirke's man RP Shah has been a consultant to Thakur since he became secretary.\"\n\nShashank Manohar might have been the architect of most reforms the BCCI carried out since last October, but Thakur also played an important role in endorsing those changes. Officials say Thakur was involved closely in preparing the BCCI's initial document on conflict of interest, which was sent to all members last year, and that he also had a say in appointing the global consultancy firm Deloitte as an independent regulator. Thakur also stressed the need to release the domestic cricket schedule in July, well before the start of the season.\n\nAnother important decision taken at Thakur's behest was drawing up contracts for India's women cricketers. The news also surprised the players. When India Women beat New Zealand, the BCCI announced an award. One of the players said then that it must be \"some five lakhs [approximately US$7500] to be distributed among the team\". The actual reward was Rs 20 lakhs ($29,700), which left the player and her team-mates speechless.\n\nThakur has also earned the respect of his critics. A high-ranking board official is willing to allow him time to grow in his new job. \"It is a fresh start, a new innings [for Thakur]. We have disagreed on things, but now that he is taking on a new role, I am actually welcoming it.\"\n\nAll the officials ESPNcricinfo spoke to for this story were sceptical about whether, as an active member of a national political party, Thakur will have enough time for the BCCI's affairs, at a critical time when the board is involved in a tussle with the Supreme Court over the Lodha Committee recommendations. \"It takes a lot of effort to get in touch with him,\" the critic quoted above said.\n\nOther political heavyweights have served as BCCI presidents in the past: SN Wankhede, NKP Salve, Madhavrao Scindia and Sharad Pawar have juggled the job with their political roles.\n\nThakur's most immediate challenge will arrive in July, when the Supreme Court issues its order on implementing the Lodha Committee reforms. Last Saturday, Manohar revealed that his conscience did not allow him to continue as the board president, because he did not agree entirely with the Lodha recommendations.\n\nThakur's responsibility as president will be to ensure that things are put in place not only at the BCCI level but also at all the state associations, while having them on his side. Having served as secretary, he is aware of the hurdles he will face. \"Now it is about handling challenges the BCCI faces in a unified way,\" a Thakur critic said.\n\nDespite the challenges, Thakur's camp is confident he is the right man to lead the BCCI in these fragile times. \"He is sharp,\" an official said. \"He is not an in-depth man. Not a man of great details. But he has understanding, has a grasp and has an intuitive feel for what should be done.\"",

    "raw_text": "Jimmy Butler's absence from the Miami Heat lineup has sent shockwaves through the team, both on the court and in the fantasy basketball world. Suspended three times in January, Butler's future with the franchise is in serious doubt. With the Feb. 6 NBA trade deadline rapidly approaching, there's speculation that Miami could move on from its star forward, and even if he isn't dealt, it's possible he has played his last game in a Heat uniform.\n\nWithout Butler, Miami's rotation has shifted, creating new opportunities for several players to step up and several have seen their fantasy values rise with increased usage and production. For fantasy managers, adapting to these changes is key as the season moves into its final months.\n\nHere's a look at three Heat players whose fantasy values have improved most in Butler's absence.\n\nTyler Herro, PG/SG\n\nHerro is having the best season of his career, by a long shot. He has averaged 24.1 PPG, 3.9 3PG, 5.6 RPG and 5.4 APG, all career-best marks for him. These numbers have also translated to Herro ranking No. 33 in the NBA in fantasy points per game.\n\nMuch of this was accomplished with Herro being the Heat's top option with Butler out. In 20 games without Butler this season, Herro's averages (25.0 PPG, 6.1 APG, 5.8 RPG) are almost two points, more than 1.5 assists and a rebound higher than in the 24 games he has played next to Butler (23.5 PPG, 4.8 APG, 5.4 RPG). So, the takeaway is that if Butler is gone and another impact player isn't brought in to replace him, Herro locks in as a top-30 fantasy hoops player with top-25 achievable upside.\n\nKel'el Ware, C\n\nFor those that grew up watching/reading Superman comics, you know that his real name is Kal El. Well, the Heat are welcoming in a rookie this season with a very similar name in Kel'el Ware. Without Butler, the team has reconfigured away from the elite, do-everything wing model with Butler handling an inside/outside approach. While Herro is the main \"outside\" threat, on the interior Ware has joined Bam Adebayo to give the Heat a high-upside duo to build around.\n\nWare was impressive live at the Las Vegas Summer League, but started his rookie season largely on the bench. His coming out party was earlier this month when the Heat paired Ware and Adebayo to try to slow down Victor Wembanyama... and it worked, with Ware having a huge game and the Heat winning by 21. Ware moved into the Heat's starting lineup in the next game.\n\nStylistically, Ware has the combination of 3-point shooting and shot-blocking that has made players like Myles Turner so valuable in fantasy basketball circles, and he has shown it since he started getting major minutes. Starting with that game against the Spurs, Ware has averaged 18.6 PPG, 9.8 RPG, 2.0 3PG and 1.8 BPG in 34.6 MPG in his past five outings. He is still available in 72.0% of ESPN leagues, and if he is in your league you should pick him up right now. Ware is projected to be a top-75 player moving forward with top-50 upside.\n\nJaime Jaquez Jr., SG/SF\n\nJaquez was on my fantasy hoops radar entering this season after he turned in a strong, All-Rookie campaign last season. Through the first half of the season, however, Jaquez has taken a step back. After posting 11.9 PPG in 28.2 MPG as a rookie, Jaquez has fallen to 9.5 PPG in 23.8 MPG in Year 2.\n\nBut, much of this decline has occurred when Butler was playing. In 21 games with Butler, Jaquez has averaged only 8.3 PPG and 2.2 APG in 21.2 MPG, but in 19 games without Butler, Jaquez has produced 10.9 PPG and 3.4 APG in 26.7 MPG.\n\nAcross the board, that's about a 25% increase in both opportunity and production from Jaquez without Butler. That at least gets Jaquez (available in 65.1% of ESPN leagues) back on the radar as a fantasy hoops streamer on a daily basis, and if he's able to play himself into starter minutes for the Heat down the stretch he still has the type of upside to use in your flex spot.\n\nWhat to do going forward\n\nBoost the value of the Heat players from top to bottom.\n\nHerro solidifies as a legit fantasy impact player that I would trade for if I could get him for his typical value. Expect him to outplay his previous levels moving forward.\n\nWare should be universally rostered. Trade for him if you can get him at \"recent hot pickup from the waiver wire\" prices. His actual value should be as an \"every day fantasy hoops starter\" moving forward.\n\nIt could be wise to take a chance on waiver wire players like Jaquez or Duncan Robinson (available in 84.0% of ESPN leagues) because they have the upside to make either solid streamers or potentially grow into fantasy flex options while Butler isn't playing.",

    "raw_text": "Sushil Kumar, Yogeshwar Dutt, Bajrang Punia, Ravi Dahiya and Aman Sehrawat -- India's last five winners of Olympic medals in men's wrestling (the only other was KD Jadhav, in 1952). But there's something else that connects this most illustrious group of Indian sportsmen: Chhatrasal Stadium.\n\nAll of them were trained, had their skills finessed, in Chhatrasal, the legendary residential academy (akhada is the more apt name) situated in north-west Delhi. It's not an exaggeration to call it the country's wrestling nursery, where aspiring wrestlers, mainly from the neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, come as children and spend years here learning the sport. And when they win laurels, as so many have done, each of them credits their success to Chhatrasal.\n\nSituated in the congested Model Town neighbourhood, there's little indication from the outside of its legendary status. The boundary walls are adorned with the neatly painted faces of Subhas Chandra Bose, Neeraj Chopra, and Ravi Dahiya - the only clues that it could be a sporting facility. It's only the imposing 10-feet-high black iron gate structure that bears the name and give it away.\n\nWalking in, you'll see a basketball court and kabaddi court on the outside and a running track and football field surrounded by a 16,000-seater stand. The stadium hosted football club Sudeva FC's I-League matches last year, state athletics events are held on the running track, and it's also been used for local events and Independence Day celebrations.\n\nBut what catches your attention is the beeline of muscular young men marching towards a ramp that leads to an underground hall. The indoor training hall - located in what used to be a car parking lot - is the heartbeat of the campus, where those five Olympic medals were made.\n\nThe pedigree is so rich it deserves mentioning again:\n\nSushil Kumar: India's most successful wrestler at the Olympics with two medals and India's first wrestling world champion.\n\nYogeshwar Dutt: Bronze medallist at the 2012 London Games\n\nBajrang Punia: Bronze at the Tokyo Olympics and the only Indian wrestler ever to have four World Championship medals\n\nRavi Dahiya: Only the second Indian wrestler ever to win an Olympic silver medal\n\nAnd now Aman, bronze medallist at 22 and reckoned to have a bright future ahead of him\n\nThe institutional knowledge - the fact that generations of wrestling greats have been groomed here - is one reason for Chhatrasal's status. What probably makes the place truly unique, though, is its democratic way of functioning: no matter who you are, you're still treated the same as others. Legend has it that Sushil used to sleep on the floor, without any AC, before his Olympic medals.\n\nIt's why in a few days from now, despite having an Olympic medal to his name, Aman will happily return to his 40-square-foot room in the campus - a room that he shares with two others. The room is filled with inspirational writing and messages on the wall; there's a tiny pantry attached; the washroom is a 30m walk away.\n\nAman's success predates the Olympics - he was the first Indian male ever to win the U23 World Championships and is an Arjuna Awardee, but he's not received any special treatment. He trains with everyone else, getting up at the crack of dawn for the morning session, doing 600-1000 uthak baithaks (sit-ups) with everyone else, climbing the ropes and grappling on the sand pits before heading to the mat - and then doing it again in the evening.\n\n\"For us, everyone is equal here,\" says Aman's coach Lalit Kumar while pointing to a 17-year-old wrestler. That's Ankush, who is Chhatrasal's next-big-thing in the 57kg category, part of this assembly line.\n\nAnd that has a lot to do with the kind of legends they grow up around. Each budding wrestler goes through a rigorous trial conducted by the coaches and are accepted only if they display their potential. Wrestlers are accepted to the institution from the age of 10 and they attend schools nearby. It's important for them to attend school as that allows them to compete at school-level tournaments and that in turn helps the academy raise funds.\n\nThe academy was founded by Dronacharya awardee Satpal Singh in 1988. After winning three consecutive silvers at the Commonwealth Games and a gold at the 1982 Asian Games, Satpal was appointed as a deputy director in the education department of the Delhi government [Ravi Dahiya holds the same post now].\n\nSatpal wasn't able to medal in two Olympics and wanted to fulfill his coach Vijay Pal Yadav, aka Guru Hanuman's dream of an Olympic medal and that's how the idea of the akhada was born: with the sole aim of winning Olympic medals for India. The results are there to see.\n\nEven today, the wrestlers pay a reasonable monthly fee of \u20b93000 rupees, which takes care of their training, nutrition (unlimited non-spicy food with lots of desi ghee) and stay. It's a meagre sum considering what they get in return: a chance to learn from and train alongside India's biggest wrestlers. Aman, for example, joined as a 10-year-old and learnt the sport by watching Sushil. He would train on the same mats, do the same exercises and eat the same food as Sushil, which made him believe that one day he could do what Sushil was doing at the global stage.\n\nThe senior wrestlers are encouraged to help the younger ones in whatever way possible: for example, if one of the senior wrestlers is sponsored by a protein supplement brand or an apparel brand, he shares the stuff he gets with the three or four juniors attached with him. That helps the juniors grow and it doesn't affect the seniors since they get a lot more. That's why you'll see most of the wrestlers wearing branded wrestling outfits or guzzling on protein shakes; the system within the system makes it happen.\n\nThere are no real material comforts at Chhatrasal, you're built to be tough. When this writer visited the stadium in June, he saw a 10-year-old, among the youngest there, weeping while being comforted by his three friends. \"Ghar ki yaad aa rahi hai\" he wept. The coaches then cajoled him into feeling better, but that's how life is here. It isn't easy. That's how Aman was when he came here as a 10-year-old; he lost his parents soon after and stayed on. It's not ideal or comforting, but it's all part of the process that eventually turns them into world-beating wrestlers.\n\nThere's a new complex being built on the premises that's expected to be completed by next year. The seven-storey tower will have rooms with central air-conditioning and indoor training halls, which would add a modern touch to the current desi systems in place. Currently, some of the rooms are shared by over 10 juniors, while the senior wrestlers with big medals to their names, are allotted rooms on a three-sharing basis with a window AC unit.\n\nThere is a seamy side to the campus that has also made headlines in the recent past. The most famous case involved Sushil Kumar - the two-time Olympic medallist was arrested on murder charges after a brawl on the campus led to the death of former junior national wrestling champion Sagar Dhankhar. Sushil is currently in Tihar Jail awaiting trial.\n\nMore recently, an incident in May saw a player assault a coach, which left the coach with multiple stitches. In response, the number of students has been reduced - until recently, batches used to have 250 students, but it's been limited to 150 recently - and wrestlers now have to be back inside the campus by 9pm. The security at the entrance has also been stepped up.\n\nBut that does not change Chhatrasal's illustrious track record and it's a personal victory for Satpal, who was taunted when he launched the academy 36 years ago. \"Medal ped pe latka hai kya? [do medals grow on trees?]\" he was chided. The naysayers didn't stop him or the wrestlers from doing what they had to do.\n\n\"Chhatrasal is truly the home of Indian wrestling and has it all - Olympic medals, junior world champions, cadet champions, Arjuna awardees, Padma Shri awardees and Dronacharya awardees...all that's missing is an Olympic gold. Aman will win that in 2028,\" says Satpal.",

    "raw_text": "Carol Briggs placed her newborn son on the bed and removed all of his clothes. She tried to find herself in his face, searching his mouth, his nose, his eyes. \"Not yet,\" she thought. She saw only his father. She looked him up and down, making a mental note of each of his 10 tiny toes, chubby legs, puffy belly and two little arms reaching up at her. \"In my mind,\" Briggs says, \"that was probably going to be the last time I ever saw him.\"\n\nIt was Dec. 1, 1972, and a big snowstorm had hit the greater Pittsburgh area that week. Briggs had gone sledding with some of the other girls the night before, dragging a cardboard box up and down a big hill that emptied out right at the Zoar Home for Mothers, Babies and Convalescents in Allison Park, Pennsylvania. She woke up in labor around 2 a.m., and just 32 minutes later, she was a mother. She named her baby Jon Kenneth Briggs.\n\nHer parents and older brother drove the hour from her hometown of Youngstown, Ohio, to be with her at the hospital. After cleaning out her room at the maternity home and signing some papers, she was back in Ohio the next day, ready to resume her life as a 16-year-old high schooler and National Honor Society member.\n\nNo one outside of her immediate family and her cousin Robin knew about the baby. Only when she was preparing to sign the adoption papers did Briggs consider sharing the news with the father, a teenage fling who had gone off to college before she discovered she was pregnant. She ultimately decided against it.\n\n\"He was a kid too,\" she says. \"He was off at college on a scholarship. I think I may have felt that I kind of got myself in this, I'm gonna do what I need to do to work my way through it.\"\n\nWith her parents' blessing, Briggs had decided that when the child was born, she would put him up for adoption.\n\n\"My mother was still cleaning up my room for me once a week,\" she says. \"I wasn't in a position to be anybody's mother. I thought this was best for him, that I allow him to be placed with some family that would be able to give him all the great things that I had coming up because I had a mother and a father. I just didn't want him to get cheated out of anything.\"\n\nIn her last interaction with the adoption agency, Briggs was told that baby Jon had been placed with a doctor and his wife in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nIN EARLY 2017, now-Kansas City Chiefs running backs coach Deland McCullough signed on to coach the running backs at USC, having spent the previous six years in the same position at Indiana University.\n\nA few months before making the move to southern California, he and his wife, Darnell, welcomed their fourth son into the world. For the fourth time, the couple provided doctors with Darnell's medical history but couldn't do the same for Deland's side of the family. At 44 years old, McCullough knew nothing about where he came from.\n\nGrowing up in Youngstown, his adoptive mother, Adelle Comer, could tell him only that he was adopted at a very young age and that she had no information about his birth parents. For a long time, that was enough. McCullough wasn't interested in finding them anyway. There was enough trouble in Youngstown those days, and he didn't want to burden anyone who might have bigger things to worry about.\n\nThings changed when he had his first child, and as his family grew, so too did his desire to know of his past. He wanted to know who gave him his deep voice and his muscular build and to whom he owed his pensive nature and quiet intensity. He wondered where son Dason got his height and which grandfather or uncle his bespectacled son, Daeh, might favor. He was so hungry for information that he never questioned whether the search might lead him to answers he couldn't handle.\n\n\"I didn't know what was going to happen,\" McCullough says. \"I didn't know how people would receive things one way or another. I didn't have a plan. I just knew I wanted to find out.\"\n\nNew laws in Ohio and Pennsylvania had called for the unsealing of adoption records, giving McCullough new hope that he might find his birth parents. In November 2017, more than a year after filling out the requisite paperwork and years after his search began, he finally received his adoption files in the mail. For the first time, he saw his original birth certificate, complete with his name, Jon Kenneth Briggs, and the name of his mother, Carol Denise Briggs.\n\nThere was no information about his father.\n\nADELLE COMER WAS living in a three-bedroom house on a cul-de-sac in Youngstown with her husband, popular local radio host A.C. McCullough, and their young son, Damon, when she got the call. It was a social worker reaching out to see whether she and A.C. would come see an infant at an adoption agency in Pennsylvania. Not long after the tragic death of their second son, Alex, who died of an intestinal birth defect after just 28 days, the young couple had started serving as foster parents, and they were looking to adopt. In January 1973, they met 6-week-old baby Jon.\n\n\"He was asleep in a bassinet,\" Comer says. \"And she put him in my arms, and when he woke up, his eyes were looking straight at me. It was instant connection. Love. Mother-son.\"\n\nBy March of that year, Jon Kenneth Briggs had been renamed Deland Scott McCullough, and he was living at home with his new parents, Adelle and A.C.\n\n\"We were still in love, a good couple,\" Comer says. \"We went to church, partied, went to cookouts. We were working together and doing this together and wanting to make a home for our children. We knew that God's hand was in it. Deland came so fast to us. We knew that it was meant to be. Both of us.\"\n\nBut things changed quickly. Comer's father had a stroke, and though A.C. wanted to put him in a nursing home, Comer brought her dad to live with the family in Youngstown. Their marriage deteriorated, and when Deland was just 2 years old, A.C. moved out.\n\n\"They went through a lot of hurt and disappointment, but they took it,\" Comer says of her sons. \"I said, 'God gives you an example of what to be and what not to be. You have to make the choice.' And that's all I had to say, and they got it.\"\n\nWhen Deland was in elementary school, Comer came home to find that he had cut three gashes into the couch for which she had just finished two years of layaway payments. Kids at school had been teasing him about being adopted, and he accused Comer of loving him less than her birth son, Damon. She explained that she loved the two boys differently, one because he had been in her belly and the other because she had chosen him. After that, Deland McCullough rarely spoke of his adoption. He got good at pretending to be whole.\n\n\"The void was there,\" he says. \"I wish that it wasn't, but I think I did a good job of hiding it.\"\n\nAfter the divorce, Comer had relationships with a few other men, some of whom were combative and abusive. \"Some men don't understand what respect is,\" she says. \"I've got two sons, and I'm not gonna allow my children to grow up with this type of lifestyle, this drama.\"\n\nDamon sometimes tried to physically defend her, but then he left for college, and Deland felt too small, physically and emotionally, to step in. His response to the violence was to try to tune it out, become emotionless, put blinders on and dream of a way out of the house and out of Youngstown.\n\nComer acknowledges that she contributed to the chaos in her own way as well.\n\n\"Biggest drama queen in the world, OK?\" she says. \"They called me Ma Barker because I'd shoot you and ask questions later.\"\n\nComer took Deland with her to therapy for a while, hoping to make things at home a little less turbulent. New boyfriends came and went, but she mostly settled into life as a single mom, taking on multiple jobs to support her sons, including as a switchboard operator at the Cuyahoga County Department of Human Services, a waitress, a social worker and a short-order cook at the local bowling alley. She did her best to rear the boys on her own, but they moved a lot, and she struggled to pay the bills, sometimes having to choose between electricity and a working phone.\n\nBut Comer stressed the importance of an education, insisting that she see the boys' homework to make sure they were taking it seriously. She taught them the value of a dollar and the importance of faith, demanding that they use a portion of their monthly child support for Sunday school and tithes at church. And she was always shuttling them to activities, from the theater program at the Youngstown Playhouse to football, basketball and track practices.\n\nDeland was a bit of a late bloomer in terms of talent, but the passion for football was always there. Early on in pee wee, he heard his name over the loudspeaker and a light went off in his head. He fell in love with the game and started carrying a football with him everywhere he went, even to bed.\n\n\"It was an escape,\" he says. \"When I was out there practicing, you didn't think about the electric is off, you know? You didn't even think about anything like that. You were just out there balling, doing your thing and competing and bonding with your friends.\"\n\nComer was a one-woman cheer squad, bringing multiple signs to Deland's games and running up and down the sideline rooting him on. One night when her ride didn't show up, she took her son's moped to the game. He looked up in the stands and saw her, still wearing his moped helmet, hollering and screaming for him: \"D-MACK! D-MACK!\"\n\nAs a junior defensive back, Deland saw himself playing football at a small school or enlisting in the Navy, but an opportunity to show his talent at the running back position his senior year drew the eye of college recruiters. Suddenly, he was being pursued by the likes of Jim Tressel, then the head coach at Youngstown State; Bob Stoops, then the defensive backs coach at Kansas State; and Sherman Smith, then the running backs coach at Miami of Ohio.\n\nDELAND MCCULLOUGH LOOKED out the window of his third-period English class at Campbell Memorial High School and saw a tall man emerge from a candy apple red Mercedes-Benz with tan interior and tricked-out gold rims. A few minutes later, he got a pink slip message to leave class and go to the office, where the tall man stuck out his hand and said, with a firm handshake, \"I'm Sherman Smith, the running backs coach at Miami University.\"\n\nA former star quarterback at Miami, Smith was a second-round draft pick at running back for the Seahawks and went on to play eight years in the NFL. He had a booming voice, thick arms and broad, square shoulders. He walked and talked and carried himself like a former pro; McCullough was immediately drawn to him.\n\n\"It was just something about his personality,\" McCullough says. \"The way he presented himself. He had things that I hadn't seen out of a man or mentor. He was on top of his details. He was successful. He had played in the NFL. He got his degree. I wasn't around that type of person.\n\n\"The Mercedes was nice, too, you know?\" he laughed. \"That was slick.\"\n\nAs a Youngstown native himself, Smith thought guys from the area were tough, but the coaches told him McCullough was special -- a thin kid, but when he couldn't run around people, he'd go through them. McCullough was serious that day in the office, offering few smiles and answering with a lot of \"Yes, sir\" and \"No, sir,\" but he was also intelligent and expressive. Smith thought he'd very much like to work with him.\n\nThe feeling was mutual. Despite interest from other schools, the decision to attend Miami University was easy for McCullough, especially after the home visit, during which Smith charmed Comer as well.\n\n\"Well, Coach Smith was hard not to love,\" Comer says, laughing. \"I fell in love with him the first time. He was just a gentleman. And he was very attentive and respectful to me.\"\n\nSmith drove them to visit the school and was back at Campbell Memorial a few months later for signing day, when McCullough signed his letter of intent to play at Miami. When McCullough arrived on campus, the coaches tried to turn him into a wide receiver, but he pushed for an opportunity to work with Smith and the running backs, accepting a redshirt freshman year to pursue the position he believed he was meant to play.\n\n\"I would tell the players, 'You may not be looking for a father, but I'm going to treat you like you're my sons,'\" Smith says. \"And so I just looked at every guy like my son. I just wanted to be a positive role model for Deland and exemplify what I thought my father exemplified for me.\"\n\n\"He was everything,\" McCullough says. \"If anything was going on, I was going to talk to Coach Smith. Everybody in that room gravitated towards Coach Smith just because that's the type of person he was. What he's about rubs off on you, so I always wanted to be around that.\"\n\nSmith left Miami University after that season to be the tight ends coach at the University of Illinois, but he and McCullough stayed in touch. He watched from afar as McCullough put together a Hall of Fame career in Oxford, rushing 36 touchdowns and setting a school record with 4,368 rushing yards. McCullough was surprised when his name wasn't called in the 1996 draft, but he was invited to a few workouts and ended up signing with the Bengals. He was leading the NFL in preseason rushing before he suffered a season-ending knee injury in Cincinnati's final exhibition game. After a few more looks in the NFL, a couple of seasons in Canada, several more knee surgeries and a brief flirtation with the XFL, McCullough finally accepted in 2001 that the dream of pro football was over.\n\nA few years later, married and the father of one son, McCullough took a job teaching communications and coaching football at Harmony Community School in Cincinnati. Despite rising to the ranks of principal and making a good salary, his first taste of coaching gave him the itch to coach full time, and he reached out to his alma mater about an opportunity to join the staff.\n\nSmith had followed a similar path, first teaching and coaching high schoolers, then working his way up the ranks from Miami University to the University of Illinois, the Houston Oilers, the Washington Redskins and, finally, the running backs coach for the Seahawks. He was with Seattle when he got a call from McCullough, asking for advice as he started his new job at Miami University.\n\nBy 2014, McCullough was coaching at Indiana University, and the two were reunited on the field, as Smith welcomed McCullough to Seattle for a coaching internship. He saw firsthand that his former player had a real future on the sideline. He had no idea that off the field, McCullough was consumed by the search for his family.\n\nA FEW DAYS before Thanksgiving 2017, Carol Briggs got home from work, sat down on the couch and opened a Facebook message from an unfamiliar man: \"Did you have a baby in 1972 in Allegheny County that you placed for adoption?\"\n\n\"Luckily, I was already sitting,\" she says.\n\nBriggs had thought often of baby Jon. Every year, she wished him a \"Happy Birthday\" on her Facebook wall, and she regularly searched adoption websites to see if he might be looking for her. Briggs could still hear her mother's voice, saying more and more often in the years before she died, \"You need to find that boy.\" Never married and without any other children, Briggs would joke to her cousin Robin that one day baby Jon might show up at her door and walk in to find her home alone, dancing around the house to Funkadelic.\n\nShe called her older brother, who warned her that the message might be from someone trying to bribe or extort her. She responded anyway, and after a few short messages, she agreed to speak to McCullough on the phone that night after he got out of practice. In the hours before the call, she Googled his name and read every article she could find. She stared at his pictures and tried to find herself in his face. It wasn't hard to see it now: the mouth, the nose, the eyes.\n\nMcCullough called Briggs from a hallway at USC as he awaited the start of a football family dinner.\n\nThey spoke as if they'd known each other for years, an easy back and forth as they shared where life had taken them in the 44 years since she'd laid him down on that bed and let him go. She learned that he had never gone to live with a doctor in Columbus, that in fact they had been just a few miles away from each other in Youngstown for all of McCullough's childhood. She likely shopped at the same grocery store as Adelle Comer, perhaps even passing young McCullough in the aisles. She was certain that her sports-fanatic father, now deceased, had read about McCullough's high school exploits in the paper.\n\nMcCullough was overjoyed to find his birth mother, though a mother had never been what he was missing.\n\n\"Within probably the first five or six minutes, he says, 'Who is my father?'\" Briggs says.\n\nShe took a breath. She had probably told only three people the man's name. After making the decision to not tell the father all those years ago, she had been determined to never let him learn of the baby years later because of careless gossip.\n\nShe hesitated but decided McCullough had a right to know.\n\n\"Your father's name is Sherman Smith,\" Briggs told him.\n\nMcCullough, leaning against a wall in the hallway, felt as though he might pass out.\n\nHe started flashing back to all of his memories with Smith and all the times people had joked about him being a carbon copy of his coach. Throughout college, when he returned to coach at Miami University, during his internship with the Seahawks.\n\n\"'Man, you and Coach Smith look alike.' 'Man, you all walk alike.' 'Y'all this, y'all this,'\" McCullough says. \"There's no reason to connect those dots because you weren't even thinking about them. A sense of pride that went through me, like, 'Wow, that explains these things.' And then I also start thinking about all the similarities of our path. That just blew me away.\"\n\nNot only had he known his father for 28 years, but Smith was also his mentor, the man he had looked up to since he was 16 years old. McCullough thought of a photo of him and Smith at Campbell Memorial High, both beaming as he signed his letter of intent to play at Miami University. The same photo he had pinned to the corkboard that hung in his college dorm room. The same photo that was at that moment sitting in a Ziploc bag in the drawer of his nightside table, a bag that had traveled with him through every job and every move.\n\n\"If you would have told me to pick who my father was, there's no way I would have picked him because I might have thought I wasn't worthy for him to be my father,\" McCullough says. \"I felt like my blessings came full circle because I'd always wanted to be somebody like him.\"\n\n\"I could hear him take a big breath,\" Briggs says. \"And I could kind of hear him choke up a little. And finally he says, 'Well, I've known Sherman my whole life.'\"\n\nTHE NEXT MORNING, McCullough texted Smith asking if they could talk about something important. It was November, and Smith assumed that McCullough had gotten a coaching opportunity he wanted to discuss. Instead, McCullough began by talking about his search for his birth parents, how he had found his biological mother, and she was from Youngstown, just like them.\n\n\"Praise the Lord!\" Smith recalls saying. \"What a blessing!\"\n\n\"And then he said, 'I asked her who my biological father was, and she said you.'\"\n\nSmith was quiet. Sixty-three years old, he had been married to his college sweetheart for 42 years and had reared a grown son and a daughter. He hadn't heard the name Carol Briggs in more than four decades. He never knew she was pregnant, never knew there was a baby. He knew he couldn't deny the possibility that he was McCullough's father, but he wanted proof. Even more, he wanted time to think. He asked McCullough if he could call him back later. Stunned and a little hurt, McCullough agreed.\n\nSmith sat in his office. Guilt washed over him. Even though he hadn't been told about the baby, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had let Briggs and McCullough down. He felt awful that he had left Briggs in such a difficult position and regretted all the years he had missed out on being a father to McCullough. He had built a life making a difference in young men's lives. He had spoken to his athletes and his kids about being responsible, being accountable.\n\n\"Being irresponsible is not neutral,\" Smith says. \"When you're irresponsible, someone becomes responsible for what you've been irresponsible for.\"\n\nHe thought about what this would say about him as a man and found himself hoping that a paternity test would show that he wasn't McCullough's father. It was a thought that brought him only more guilt.\n\nHe asked to speak to Briggs.\n\nBriggs cried her way through work the day she was set to talk to Smith. \"I hadn't talked to Sherman in 45 years. And after 45 years, this is probably not the icebreaker conversation that you want to have with the guy that you used to fool around with. 'Hey, we've got a 45-year-old son. And how are you?' So, no, I wasn't looking forward to that at all. Not at all.\"\n\nThere was no need to worry. Smith was calm and kind, and the two settled into a nice conversation, catching up for a long time before they even got to talking about McCullough. Smith apologized to her for her having to make such a difficult decision at such a young age, and Briggs explained why she had felt it was best to not tell Smith about the baby. She said that over the years, she just wanted to know that McCullough was OK, and Smith reassured her that her son was a good man.\n\nBriggs hung up full of emotion but relieved that Smith wasn't angry with her. Smith hung up feeling much more certain that McCullough was his son.\n\nSmith talked to his wife, Sharon, and his brother, Vincent. He talked to his children, Sherman and Shavonne. He thought about McCullough's coaching internship a few years earlier, how Seahawks assistant offensive line coach Pat Ruel hadn't stopped cracking jokes about Smith and his protege acting like a father-son duo.\n\nMcCullough sent Smith an old article from his days in the CFL, and Smith couldn't believe his eyes. \"I'm looking at this thing and thinking, 'I don't remember taking this picture. I don't remember doing this article,'\" Smith says. \"I'm looking at Deland, and I'm thinking it's me. That got me.\n\n\"I called my aunt in Youngstown, and I told her about it. And she'd went on YouTube and pulled up some pictures of Deland, and she called me back. She said, 'Nephew, I can save you the money on the DNA tests.'\"\n\nThe more Smith thought about it, the more he realized the story wasn't about him and his guilt. It was about McCullough and what he had been through. It was about a life without a father, about the years McCullough had spent looking for his birth parents, hoping to fill a void, wanting to know where he'd come from.\n\n\"It was said that humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less,\" Smith says. \"I started thinking about Deland.\"\n\nSometime in the weeks between that first phone call and the test results, Smith realized that he was hoping he was McCullough's father. That, in fact, he would be devastated if the results came back otherwise. When the test came in, it showed a 99.99 percent chance that Smith was, indeed, McCullough's father. Both were elated.\n\n\"I look at it, and I just say it's a God thing,\" Smith says. \"It's grace. It's undeserved. And that's what's made it great for Deland and for all of us, how everyone has embraced this and is excited about our new family.\"\n\nMcCullough understood why Smith had been so curt at first. McCullough had spent his whole life wondering about his birth parents. Briggs had spent her whole life wondering about her child. Smith had gone from zero to a 45-year-old son in one phone call; he needed time.",

    "raw_text": "Between 2011 and 2021, Chinglensana Singh Kangujam played more than 200 matches for the India hockey team. He scored 28 goals, was vice-captain, part of two Asian Games medal campaigns including the gold-winning effort in 2014, and competed at the Rio Olympics. Along the way, he won an Arjuna Award in 2018 for his contributions to the sport. Chinglensana's dream was to win an Olympics medal with the Indian team - but when India finally won an Olympic medal in 2021 after 41 years, Chinglensana wasn't there.\n\nDropped from the team before the Tokyo Olympics, he quit the game immediately. Not just hung up his boots, Chinglensana refused to pick up the stick and even stopped watching hockey matches.\n\n\"I just left hockey. When I couldn't make it to the Tokyo squad, I left,\" Chinglensana, now 33, tells ESPN. \"I never made an official announcement.\"\n\nYet his is a name that evokes memories even today, and especially in the context of the Hockey India League. He was a regular in its first iteration, playing in all five seasons from 2013 to 2017. It's one of the cruel ironies of sport, though, that when the HIL re-started, and Chinglensana was persuaded by friends to return to the game and put his name in the auction pool, there were no takers for the player who only a few years ago was the heartbeat of the Indian team's midfield.\n\n*****\n\nChinglensana emerged from the low-profile Manipur hockey system but soon made his mark on the national and international stages. He made it to the national team in 2011 as a forward but subsequent head coaches saw him more as an efficient midfielder who could run all day. Neither a prolific goal-scorer nor a flashy dribbler - it's difficult to find highlights of Chinglensana's game on YouTube -- he was instead a midfielder with an exceptionally high work rate, which also became the defining feature of the national team since 2016.\n\nPlaying alongside the legendary Manpreet Singh, Chinglensana provided solidity in the centre of the pitch while being excellent with his pressing and tracking back. He played a vital role in improving the standards of the Indian men's hockey team post 2012, ultimately recognised in the form of the Arjuna Award.\n\nHe suffered a double fracture on his ankle while playing the senior national domestic tournament in early 2019. The extent of the injury was discovered during the national team camp a few weeks later and a medical scan revealed that he would miss many months. He was out for a year, but he always believed that he would recover completely and play for several more years.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic gave him more time to rest and recuperate and he returned to the national setup in 2021 when India coach Graham Reid called him up for the Pro League matches, just before the Tokyo Olympics. He played a few matches but eventually, Reid opted to keep him out of the Tokyo squad.\n\n\"I was hoping that I would make the squad. When I didn't make it, I was like, what's the point of playing hockey now. I left it. I had a dream of playing at the Tokyo Olympics. The head coach (Graham Reid) called me after the announcement of the team. He wanted to have a conversation, but I didn't feel like going for it and I didn't,\" Chinglensana said.\n\nThe likely reason for him missing out could be fitness related. By 2021, Chinglensana had missed almost two years of hockey action. Maybe his game had taken a beating or maybe Reid felt the squad had fitter players or maybe he didn't just fit in with the structure anymore. But since then, he's has been trying to come to terms with his non-selection.\n\n\"In terms of regrets, yes. I couldn't make it to the team even though I felt my performances were decent. I had recovered from my ankle injury, but I couldn't make it,\" Chinglensana said, his voice tinged with sadness. \"Life toh thik hai, but I was upset for a long time. I stopped following hockey for the next two-three years. I didn't pick up the hockey stick for three years, I was not in touch with my teammates.\"\n\nEven though he didn't want to do anything with hockey, his old international teammates, namely SV Sunil and SK Uthappa, and coaches pushed him to get back to the game. After constantly talking to his childhood coach Romesh Kestrimayum, Chinglensana finally began his journey back to hockey.\n\n\"Now I'm slightly better. I realised that whatever little impact I made in my life, it's because of hockey. I was upset and sad, but I am now doing coaching for juniors in Manipur. I am also a selector for Hockey India, trying to identify talent from my state.\"\n\nChinglensana has also started playing hockey again. He represented his state in the recent senior nationals and put his name in for the HIL auction pool. Doubly cruel was that his friends Sunil and Uthappa were both picked by teams.\n\nCurrently, he is preparing his state team for the National Games, where he would also like to play. He got married a few months back and settled in Imphal. His priorities are set: he wants to bring out the best hockey talents from his state. \"If you see other states, like Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka and compare it with Manipur, the sports facilities are much more developed. Our budgets and players are also low. We are talking about how to develop more interest in the sport in our state.\"\n\nHe's also constantly in touch with other international players from Manipur, like Nilakanta Sharma, Kothajit Singh and Rabichandra Singh Moirangthem. Chinglensana helped them when they were coming up the ranks and they still ask him for guidance. He wants to take the best inputs and give upcoming youngsters a good platform in the state.\n\nThis matters now more than ever given the violence in Manipur since May 2023. \"It had a big impact on the newer generation. They want to go to the grounds, but they are closed. They want to go schools, but they are also closed. If everything is closed, how will the future generation take up anything? It becomes extremely difficult for them,\" he said.\n\nBut there are certain things he cannot forget. He still can't bring himself to watch hockey matches. He didn't see a single minute of India's triumphs at both Tokyo and Paris Olympics. \"Sirf India games nahin, poora hockey dekhna chhod diya (Not just India matches, I don't watch hockey at all anymore.)\n\nFor Chinglensana, the wound has healed but it has left a permanent scar.",

We hope we can get it signed [on Friday]. It's an important transfer for a very good player with tremendous potential. But these types of offers, for the club and the player, are difficult to reject because of the figures. We evaluated the pros and cons and decided to accept it.\n\n\"[We can't compete with Saudi Arabia] from a standpoint of transfer fee and wages. In Duran's case, it [the salary Al Nassr have offered] quintuples the wages he gets at Aston Villa.

The Portugal forward has clocked just 363 minutes in the Premier League this season -- scoring one goal in those 12 appearances -- since joining on a permanent transfer from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid last summer.\n\nAsensio, meanwhile, has failed to live up to expectations at Paris Saint-Germain since his arrival from Real Madrid in the summer of 2023.\n\nThe Spain forward has scored two goals in 16 appearances across all competitions this season.\n\n\"One month before I arrived to Villa, two summers ago, Aston Villa tried to sign Asensio before he decided to join PSG,\" Monchi said. \"We have tried to bring F\u00e9lix in all the transfer windows.

They are not easy operations, one in terms of wages and another in terms of transfer cost. It's not easy but I cannot deny that they are players that attract Unai.\"\n\nMonchi believes that Villa and Emery would offer F\u00e9lix the right environment to succeed. The Portugal international has not met expectations since joining Atl\u00e9tico in a \u20ac126m move from Benfica in July 2019.\n\n\"If there is a coach in world football that can recover players and bring out the best, that is Unai Emery,\" Monchi said.",

    "raw_text": "The 2025 badminton season is all set to begin with a bang on Tuesday with the Malaysia Open Super 1000 -- the highest tier of the BWF Tour.\n\nFrom an Indian perspective, this season marks a new era, transitioning after the Paris Olympics with new foreign coaches and a renewed goal of stepping up on the BWF titles pyramid. Winning big tour titles should be the new year resolution for most Indian badminton players.\n\nThe only Indians to do it consistently are Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty. Tan Kim Her -- the man instrumental in putting this pair together back in the day -- is back as their doubles coach, making this is the most intriguing narrative to watch out for in 2025.\n\nIn singles, the return of HS Prannoy after a long injury layoff, Lakshya Sen's development from dangerous floater to consistent player and the bench strength of women's badminton in the absence of PV Sindhu will be the big storylines.\n\nHere's a look at the Indians' draw and chances at the first tournament of 2025:\n\nMen's Singles\n\nAll eyes in men's singles will be on Lakshya Sen, the one with most potential who must make a bigger, and consistent, leap in 2025.\n\nThis time last year, the 22-year-old was languishing in a first-round losing slump. In 2025, he is coming off a Super 300 title at Syed Modi and a third-place finish at the inaugural King's Cup, an invitational badminton tournament put together by the legendary Lin Dan in China.\n\nAs discussed earlier, Lakshya's ability is without question, but what he needs is the mental wherewithal to take the next step -- big titles -- which will only come with consistent performances every week. The highest ranked Indian at world No 12, he will look to get back into the top 8, for seedings and better draws at big events.\n\nIn Malaysia, he starts against Chi Yu Jen in what is their first meeting. A win will likely pit him against fourth seed Viktor Axelsen in a repeat of the Olympic semifinal which the Indian lost from a winning position. In a throwback to older times, he's in the same section as fellow Indians HS Prannoy and Priyanshu Rajawat.\n\nPrannoy is making his badminton comeback after an almost four-month layoff. The 32-year-old, a top-10 player till the Olympics, has now fallen to world no. 26 after taking a break to recover from a series of health setbacks including a bout of chikungunya right before the Olympics. He has worked hard on his fitness and physicality in the time away and will look to start afresh in 2025, not having played since Paris 2024.\n\nPrannoy starts his campaign against young Canadian Brian Yang, in what is their first meeting. While some rustiness to be expected, it's hard to predict a path ahead for Prannoy but a win could bring an even bigger challenge in the second round -- seventh seed Li Shi Feng. The Chinese starts his campaign against another Indian, Priyanshu Rajawat who has been promoted from reserves.\n\nOne of these will be the quarterfinalist from this section, talk about a tough sector.\n\nMen's Doubles\n\nSatwik-Chirag, now seeded seventh, are last year's finallists at the Malaysia Open and will be keen to go one step further in their new Coach Tan era.\n\nIt'll be a challenge this time though, as they are they haven't had much match practise lately. The duo has played only once since the Olympics -- at the season-ending China Masters Super 750 -- where they gave a very good account of themselves by reaching the semis. Yet, the time away and Satwik's injury layoff showed itself in their game. They would have had time with Tan to get into a rhythm and work on areas of improvement, which will now be tested on court.\n\nIn Malaysia, they have a relatively simpler path, opening against Ming Che Lu and Tang Kai Wei in the first round (1-0 lead.) The other seeds in their section are fourth seeds Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto, whom they lead 4-0 and has beaten at the Olympics too.\n\nIf things go well, the first big test will be the semifinals where they could face old rivals and Olympic vanquishers Aaron Chia and Soh Wooh Yik or Chinese second seeds Liang Wei Kang and Wang Chang, who beat them in the final last year.\n\nIrrespective of the final matchups though, Sat-Chi will be the ones to watch out for in the tournament -- fit again and raring to prove that the second half of 2024 was an injury-driven blip.\n\nWomen's Singles\n\nThere is no PV Sindhu, who recently got married, in the draw but it's heartening to see three Indians names at the Super 1000 level -- Malvika Bansod, Aakarshi Kashyap, and Anupama Upadhyaya. While they are still ranked on the fringes of the top 32, they have been consistently making BWF main draws last year and will look for a step further -- deep runs with upset wins this year.\n\nWorld no. 32 Malvika, who had a solid quarterfinal run at her last Super 1000 (admittedly just after the Olympics), will start against Goh Jin Wei. The experienced Malaysian has beaten her in their only meeting.\n\nWorld no. 46 Anupama faces a tough opener against Thailand's eighth-seeded Pornpawee Chochuwong (first meeting) while world no 47 Aakarshi takes on Denmark's Julie Dawall Jakobsen (trails 0-2.)\n\nIt's tough to chart their path ahead given how competitive the top tier of women's singles is but fact os that crossing the first-round hurdle would be the small goal right now.\n\nWomen's Doubles\n\nAnother section where India has a sizeable representation this time with three pairs, two of them seeded, as the rest of the field underwent a pairing overhaul after the Olympics.\n\nTreesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand, now seeded sixth after their end of the year exploits, will wants to start the season strong after their Syed Modi title and BWF World Tour Finals appearance. They take on Thailand's Ornnicha Jongsathapornparn and Sukitta Suwachai (first meeting) in their opener. The other seeds in their quarter are #3 Pearly Tan and Thinaah Muralitharan, old nemeses who they beat in stunning fashion at the BWF Tour Finals last month. Jia Yi Fan, one half of China's absolutely dominant pair, is also in this section with new partner Zhang Shu Xian.\n\nTanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponnappa, seeded eighth and coming off a title defence late last year at Guwahati Masters Super 100, start against Chiharu Shida, who is playing with a new partner in Misaki Matsutomo. Shida is a veteran who has often troubled the Indians but this time the seeds could get the better of the newer combination. The Panda sisters (Rutuparna and Swetaparna) have a tough opener against the experienced Aimsaard sisters (Benyapa and Nuntakarn).\n\nAll the Indian matches are first meetings so there is no head-to-head to go by but the hope would be of a good run in a field that is relatively open at this time of the season.\n\nMixed Doubles\n\nOnce again there are three Indian pairs in mixed doubles.\n\nWorld no. 34 Sathish Karunakaran and Aadya Variyath, who have started making BWF main draws regularly and can grow into a good combination. They will take on Ashith Surya and Amrutha Pramuthesh (WR 54) in an all-Indian first round match.\n\nTanisha Crasto, who started off as more of a mixed doubles player till injury to her partner Ishaan Bhatnagar, is back in the draw with Dhruv Kapila. They've slowly been climbing up the ranks (world no. 69 now) and had reached the final of the Syed Modi together. They start against Ko Sung Hyun and Eom Hye Won and a win will put them in collision course with seventh seed Cheng Xing and Zhang Chi of China.",

    "raw_text": "THIS PAST FALL, Dan Snyder had dinner in London with longtime associates. For only the second autumn since 1999, Snyder was not the owner of his beloved Washington football team.\n\nHe was not living the ups and downs of an NFL season, as he had done since his childhood in Maryland.\n\nHe was not presiding over the Commanders' rebuild, already on the cusp of a stunning turnaround, the kind of rise that Snyder lived for in a previous life: from 4-13 in 2023 to what would eventually be a 12-5 regular season and an underdog playoff run, culminating in an NFC Championship Game appearance Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nBut now Snyder is a ghost: The new-look Commanders are not only led by first-time general manager Adam Peters, new head coach Dan Quinn and sensational rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, but they also have a new ownership group, led by Josh Harris and his Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment.\n\nAt the London dinner, Snyder, 60, was polite, if not subdued, and did things the associates had come to expect, such as ordering almost everything on the menu. Snyder said that he was enjoying a quiet existence, mostly in London. Life was better for his family, far from the controversies that had engulfed him and the team the past several years. Talk inevitably turned to the improving Commanders, already off to a strong start. When one associate returned to the United States, a colleague asked him the question that's been on the minds of many fans and league executives:\n\nWhat's it like for Snyder, for years the most hated owner in sports, to watch the Commanders succeed without him?\n\n\"He f---ing hates it,\" Snyder's dinner companion told the colleague.\n\nNeither Snyder nor any of his representatives responded to interview requests from ESPN. But according to league sources, team owners, sports executives, lawyers and others with knowledge of his current status, some of whom requested anonymity to discuss sensitive legal matters, Snyder has recast much of his life since he sold the Commanders under duress 19 months ago.\n\nHe has mostly lived in London, often surrounded by a security detail, or spent time on his superyacht. He is trying to sell his remaining U.S. real estate holdings and decided to give away a $35 million estate to the American Cancer Society after it sat unsold for months. Any business he conducts is from the U.K., where sources with firsthand knowledge say he has expressed interest in buying into a Premier League soccer club, although others who know him well doubt Snyder will ever own any professional sports team again.\n\nWhat little remains for him in the United States includes a tangle of unresolved legal issues -- and the thoughts of what might have been if he had never sold the team.\n\nSNYDER NEVER WANTED to sell, even after putting the Commanders up for sale. Few people outside the league, Harris' company, or the Commanders organization know that he tried desperately to blow up the sale at the last minute.\n\nSnyder had been pressured into the sale by fellow owners who roundly hated him and league executives eager to see the franchise returned to its former glory -- and profitability. Former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue recently told confidants that Snyder is \"the worst owner in the history of the National Football League.\"\n\nA source with direct knowledge said that, after months of negotiations with Harris, Snyder was imagining ways to keep his team. One idea, the source said, was to announce that he had years earlier given up alcohol, and to say that much of his alleged misbehavior over the years that caused so much league and fellow owner angst happened while he was drunk. Snyder also purposefully set a minimum price of $6 billion for the Commanders, knowing that few people, even among the ultrarich, could afford that price tag.\n\nDespite Snyder's resistance, the sale process moved ahead, with Harris' group barely clearing the asking price. Harris needed to recruit approximately 20 limited partners.\n\nThen, on July 20, 2023, shortly after owners approved the sale for a North American sports franchise record of $6.05 billion, the NFL gave Snyder another reason to be mad, fining him a record $60 million on the way out. A league investigation led by attorney Mary Jo White not only affirmed Snyder's alleged sexual harassment of a team employee but also concluded he had fostered a toxic workplace culture and that the Commanders had withheld revenue from the NFL. Sources said Snyder was infuriated that the fine dropped the amount just below the $6 billion he had insisted on from the beginning.\n\n\"There's no way I'm paying,\" Snyder told confidants about the league fine.\n\nSuddenly, the sale's closing -- a supposed formality -- turned into an eleventh-hour drama, multiple sources with direct knowledge told ESPN. Snyder threatened to kill the deal by refusing to share his bank information, preventing Harris from wiring him the money. At 1 a.m. on July 21, Snyder and his wife were fielding phone calls from various executives and confidants, urging him to do what he'd pledged and let go of the team.\n\n\"I don't want to do this,\" Snyder told a confidant.\n\nA rally celebrating Harris' ownership group was scheduled for later that day at the since-renamed FedEx Field.\n\nBut as 1 a.m. became 2 a.m., Snyder was refusing to hand over the stadium keys.\n\n\"I don't care!\" Snyder said, according to sources with direct knowledge of what transpired in those hours. \"It would be trespassing if anyone goes there. It's still mine!\"\n\nLeague executives didn't know what Snyder would do next but told Harris' group to be on call, ready to wire the funds if and when Snyder shared his bank information -- and before he could renege.\n\nIn the days leading up to the close, sources said, Dan and Tanya Snyder were pressed by confidants and friends, including Hall of Fame coach Joe Gibbs, the three-time Super Bowl winner who supported Snyder even during the darkest times, to complete the deal out of love for the team and fans.\n\nAssociates reminded Snyder in those wee hours that the primary reason to sell was his family. The past few years of relentless revelations about bad behavior and questionable ethics, largely of Snyder's own doing, had taken a toll on his three children. Tanya reminded her husband that the sale would relieve their emotional distress. A confidant warned Snyder, \"The only way your legacy gets worse is if you rip this back now.\"\n\nQuiet minutes passed. Tanya said, \"Dan, I know this is hard. This was a dream.\"\n\nWith that, Snyder relented. He gave the go-ahead to Jason Wright, then the Commanders' team president (he declined to comment for this story), to share the bank information so the Harris Group could wire the $6.05 billion. It was finally official: Harris and his fellow investors owned the Washington Commanders. The league had finally pushed out its most hated owner. The rally the next day at FedEx Field commenced as planned.\n\nMonths later, Tad Brown, CEO of HBSE, told confidants, \"We don't get the Commanders if not for Joe Gibbs.\"\n\nDespite Snyder's protests about the $60 million fine, it was paid July 21 \"as part of the overall transaction,\" a league official confirmed.\n\n\"The fine was a condition of the sale and was included in the resolution that was voted upon and approved by the full membership,\" the official said.\n\nA spokesman for HBSE declined to comment on the sale, citing a nondisclosure agreement signed by the two sides.\n\nTHOUGH DAN SNYDER held tight to the end, Dan and Tanya Snyder had been quietly planning their second act for months. Less than three weeks after announcing on Nov. 2, 2022, that they intended to sell the Commanders, the Snyders established a company to operate in England and Wales. The document established a new company, dubbed \"Snyder UK Investments Limited,\" but it also signaled the Snyders' future intentions. On the documents setting up the company, Snyder, and Tanya, then the co-CEO of the Commanders, were asked where they \"usually\" reside.\n\nThey both answered: England.\n\nLondon made sense as the place for the Snyders to envision their post-Commanders life together. The United Kingdom holds a special place in Snyder's heart. His late father, Gerald, who was an author and freelance writer for National Geographic and United Press International, held a dual U.S.-U.K. citizenship. At the age of 12, Dan Snyder moved from Silver Spring, Maryland, to Henley-on-Thames, outside London, as his father researched and wrote a book on the Loch Ness Monster. For two years, the family lived in the U.K. and Snyder attended a private school. It was then that Snyder became a devout Anglophile who today adores London's history, culture and nightlife, associates said.\n\nSnyder left the United States with a raft of legal action against him or the team during his tenure, including expected subpoenas from federal and civil lawsuits, investigations by multiple attorneys general and a two-year-old FBI and IRS inquiry into the Commanders' finances.\n\nSince November 2022, federal prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia, have been investigating deceptive business practices alleged in an April 2022 letter that the House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nA federal grand jury was impaneled, team financial records were subpoenaed, and several former team executives met with prosecutors, sources with firsthand knowledge told ESPN. No indictments have been returned. President Donald Trump this week appointed a new interim U.S. attorney for the district, and the future of the inquiry will be up to him. Snyder has been a loyal supporter of Trump, including writing a $1 million check to the president's 2017 inaugural committee.\n\nSnyder also is the central figure in a federal lawsuit filed a year ago by one of his former minority partners against Bank of America, the bank that Snyder owed a debt of nearly $1 billion when he sold the team. In the lawsuit, a Tampa, Florida, billionaire and former minority partner of the Commanders, Robert Rothman, alleged that Bank of America conspired with the NFL and Snyder to force him and two other minority partners to sell their stake in the Commanders back to Snyder in 2021 at a valuation roughly half of the $6.05 billion Snyder was ultimately paid.\n\nThe lawsuit, which does not name Snyder as a defendant, alleges that Bank of America turned \"a blind eye\" to \"financial red flags\" raised by Snyder's management of the team, including his alleged failure to pay the partners a share of the profits and his increasing reliance on team debt to finance his lavish lifestyle.\n\nThe centerpiece of Rothman's lawsuit is Bank of America's December 2018 approval of the franchise's $55 million credit line taken out by Snyder without his minority partners' knowledge or required approval. The bank allowed Snyder to draw $38 million in March 2019 from the credit line \"without verifying Snyder had obtained board approval,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nA Bank of America spokesman has said the bank \"will vigorously defend ourselves against these allegations.\"\n\nA federal judge has given permission for Rothman's lawyers to begin to seek discovery on some of the claims in the original suit, which could include seeking sworn testimony of Snyder and NFL executives, including NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\n\"Our complaint clearly alleges my client, Bob Rothman, lost hundreds of millions of dollars because of Bank of America's actions,\" attorney Brian Kopp said. \"In the process, the bank overloaded Dan Snyder with debt, knowing that he would have to sell the team. Even though he made a lot of money selling the team, I suspect that Dan Snyder feels that he got squeezed by the bank.\"\n\nPractically, Snyder's relocation to London marked the beginning of his estrangement from some of his American friends and longtime associates, including nearly everyone connected with the NFL, according to several sources who speak with members of Snyder's inner circle. During his 24 years at the helm of the Washington football team, Snyder's closest ally among NFL owners was Jerry Jones, who told ESPN recently that he has not spoken with Snyder since he sold the team.\n\nBut bridges were burning long before the move. In October 2022, ESPN reported that Snyder told close associates that he had dug up dirt on Goodell and fellow NFL owners, including Jones, and told a close associate he would use it to \"blow up\" those who forced him to sell. \"They can't f--- with me,\" Snyder said privately.\n\nWhen it came to Snyder's nearly quarter-century partnership with the NFL, Jones said simply, \"It was time for a divorce.\"\n\nWHEN HE'S IN London -- and not aboard his 305-foot superyacht, the $180 million Lady S, which was docked this month off Harlingen in the Netherlands -- Snyder has filled some of his days visiting Westminster pubs and restaurants, a source with firsthand knowledge says. The pubs are within walking distance of the luxury hotel where he's been living while a condo he bought is being renovated, the source says. On other days, the source says, he visits the Chelsea office where his U.K.-based investment firm is housed.\n\nIt's unclear how Snyder has invested the $6.05 billion windfall he received for the team he bought for $800 million in May 1999. On documents detailing his investment firm's holdings, the Snyders list \u00a31 million in assets.\n\nOne of Snyder's post-Commanders' investments backfired in a high-profile way. Snyder invested $6 million in a film titled \"The Apprentice\" through Kinematics, an upstart production company run by his 29-year-old son-in-law, Mark Rapaport. The film tells the story of Trump's early years under the mentorship of lawyer and fixer Roy Cohn. When he made the investment, Snyder assumed the film would depict Trump positively, a source with firsthand knowledge told ESPN. But last February, Snyder screened the film with Rapaport at an island home and, the source said, became enraged by the decidedly negative portrait. The film was shelved until Kinematics finally sold off its stake last summer, and the filmmakers searched months for a U.S. distributor. In October, \"The Apprentice\" was released in the United States to box-office failure but critical acclaim and, this week, Academy Award nominations for actors Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong.\n\nWithin months of closing on the Commanders sale, the Snyders listed for sale their Potomac, Maryland, estate, known as \"River House,\" overlooking the Potomac River. The 30,000-square-foot mansion, the Snyders' main residence since 2001, was listed for $49 million, but after it sat unsold, the Snyders slashed its price to $35 million. Still, there were no buyers.\n\nFinally, in March, the Snyders donated the estate to the American Cancer Society. It was the largest gift in the organization's 110-year history; the organization has still not sold the estate. It's now listed at $29.9 million. The Snyders will be able to use the $18.5 million appraised value as a tax write-off. They've also listed for sale their Virginia estate, not far from George Washington's Mount Vernon. The asking price is $60 million, but it remains vacant and unsold.\n\nAccording to sources in London sports circles, Snyder in recent months has shopped for a piece of a soccer team, preferably in the Premier League, where exponential growth in team valuations rivals the NFL. A source close to the Premier League acknowledged hearing of Snyder's interest in a club but said no formal move has been made. \"I keep hearing he wants another act as a team owner -- the Premier League is his dream,\" said another source who was briefed on Snyder's Premier League fandom and keen interest in an ownership stake.\n\nSuch a move would be \"an act of redemption,\" the source said. \"He could maybe prove people wrong by getting a Premier League team. ... He could reinvent himself there because he can't do it here. He literally can't.\"\n\nBut other sources close to Snyder and in the Premier League believe he would never buy into a soccer club or any other professional sports team, for that matter. The reason isn't because of finances, or prestige, or even baggage.\n\n\"He isn't a fan of other sports,\" one source said. \"He's a fan of the [Commanders]. That was the biggest thing.\"\n\nAt the age of 6, Snyder attended his first Washington home game with his father, who scraped together enough money for two tickets. Snyder was hooked. \"For him, it wasn't somebody losing a team. This was different. He loved that team.\"\n\nIN THE MONTHS after the associates dined with Snyder in London, Washington's season continued its stunning rise to the NFC title game, led by Jayden Daniels, the type of superstar quarterback who Snyder for years contended might save him from being forced to sell the team.\n\nAnd D.C. has rallied around its team in ways it hasn't for decades -- since its last Super Bowl win after the 1991 season -- and in ways Washington rarely rallies around anything.\n\nIn late December, after years of lobbying by Jason Wright and other Commanders executives, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to transfer the site of the team's former home, RFK Stadium, to Washington, D.C., paving the way for a long-awaited new stadium. Suddenly it's cool again to be a Washington football fan.\n\nEven the former team employees who accused Snyder of fostering a toxic workplace have joined in, starting a text chain to discuss the turnaround with each other.\n\n\"Karma is real,\" said Melanie Coburn, the former team cheerleader and marketing director who testified about the team to Congress. \"For years, we endured the dysfunction and toxicity at the organization under Dan Snyder and blamed all the losses on the dark cloud he brought over the team. Turns out, we were right.\"\n\nSnyder's outlook has evolved. There's still anger, and he remains \"in denial\" about what led to his ouster, said a person close to his inner circle. But there's also something else: \"Sadness -- for himself,\" that person said. \"It's killing him. ... It's devastating for him.\"\n\nBut even from across the pond, Snyder's specter still hovers over the team. After Washington upset Tampa Bay in the wild-card round, its first playoff victory since Jan. 7, 2006, Josh Harris and limited partner Magic Johnson stood outside the locker room, surrounded by exuberant family members and cameras. Johnson put his right arm around Harris and spoke into the microphones.\n\n\"What does it take?\" Johnson said. \"New vision, new owner with a strategy, picking the right people ... and then, we all step out of the way and let them do their jobs.\"\n\n\"Talent, culture and people,\" Harris said.\n\nNeither man mentioned Dan Snyder's name. There was no need.",

    "raw_text": "ESPN exclusive! How one performance-enhancing treat became the NBA's Most Valuable Sandwich.\n\nby Baxter Holmes\n\n03/21/17\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on March 21, 2017. Today, April 2, is National PB&J Day.\n\nThe legend has been passed down by NBA generations, chronicled like a Homeric odyssey. The tale they tell is of Kevin Garnett and the 2007-08 Celtics, and the seminal moment of a revolution. Bryan Doo, Celtics strength and conditioning coach, recalls it as if it were yesterday, how before a game in December of that season, an unnamed Celtic -- his identity lost to history, like the other horsemen on Paul Revere's midnight ride -- complained to Doo of incipient hunger pangs.\n\n\"Man, I could go for a PB&J,\" the player said.\n\nAnd then Garnett, in an act with historical reverberations, uttered the now-fabled words: \"Yeah, let's get on that.\"\n\nGarnett had not, to that point, made the PB&J a part of his pregame routine. But on that night in Boston, as Doo recalls, Garnett partook, then played ... and played well. Afterward, from his perch as the Celtics' fiery leader, Garnett issued the following commandment: \"We're going to need PB&J in here every game now.\"\n\nAnd so a sandwich revolution was born.\n\nAt the time, Doo notes, the Celtics not only didn't provide lavish pregame spreads, they didn't offer much food at all. But he soon found himself slapping together 20 PB&J's about three hours before every tip-off, the finished products placed in bags and labeled with Sharpie in a secret code: \"S\" for strawberry, \"G\" for grape, \"C\" for crunchy. Of vital import: Garnett was an \"S\" man, and woe unto he who did not deliver him two S's before every game. \"If Kevin didn't get his routine down, he'd be pissed,\" Doo says. \"Even if he didn't eat them, he needed them to be there.\"\n\nFrom Doo's perspective, PB&J's were a far better option than players seeking out, say, greasy junk food from arena concessions. \"It was a win-win for everybody,\" he says. But as the Garnett-Paul Pierce-Ray Allen Celtics steamrolled to a 66-win season and an NBA title, the secret to their success, so cleverly disguised between two pieces of white bread, was eventually leaked. \"Boston was doing it at a mass-produced level earlier on than I noticed other people doing it, for sure,\" says Tim DiFrancesco, the Lakers' strength and conditioning coach since 2011. \"They were really on the forefront of this revolution.\" In time, as visiting teams swung through Boston, opposing players caught wind that a new day had dawned. DiFrancesco recalls hearing from his troops during a visit: \"Wait a minute, there's PB&J's in the Celtics' locker room? Can we get some?\" Doo's colleagues around the league were less effusive. \"B-Doo, I can't believe you did this for the guys,\" one told him. \"Now you got me making them.\"\n\nThere was no putting the jelly back in the jar. Over the course of the following seasons, as that Celtics championship run ran its course, the pieces of that team would be spread far and wide: Pierce and Garnett migrating the PB&J down I-95 to Brooklyn; Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis converting the Orlando Magic; Tony Allen spreading the bug to Memphis; coach Doc Rivers bringing it across the country to the Clippers.\n\nAnd nothing would ever be the same.\n\nThe Trail Blazers offer 20 crustless, halved PB&J's pregame -- 10 of them toasted, a mandate ever since an opposing arena prepared them as such and Blazers guard Damian Lillard approved. They're composed of organic fixings, save for white bread, which Portland's assistant performance coach Ben Kenyon notes is a high-glycemic carb that easily digests to provide a quick energy jolt. Typically, all 20 vanish well before tip-off; sometimes the Blazers double their order.\n\nThe Rockets make sure the PB&J is available in their kitchen at all times, in all varieties -- white and wheat bread, toasted, untoasted, Smucker's strawberry and grape, Jif creamy and chunky -- and offer 12 to 15 sandwiches pregame, with PB&J reinforcements provided at halftime and on postgame flights.\n\nThe secretive Spurs, it has been confirmed, indulge in their own pregame PB&J's. The Clippers, at home and on the road, go through two loaves of bread, almond and peanut butters, and assorted jellies from Whole Foods. The Pelicans offer PB&J everywhere: hotel rooms, flights, locker rooms. The Wizards had some \"minor uprisings\" from players, one source says, when management tried to upgrade team PB&J's with organic peanut butter on whole grain bread -- but peace was restored when each side compromised to include all options.\n\nThe Bucks might boast the NBA's most elaborate PB&J operation: a pregame buffet featuring smooth, crunchy and almond butters, an assortment of jellies (raspberry, strawberry, grape, blueberry, apricot), three breads from a local bakery (white, wheat and gluten-free) and Nutella. The team scarfs 20 to 30 PB&J's per game and travels with the ingredients, which rookies prepare on the plane and in visiting locker rooms. They've even offered their players PB&J-flavored oatmeal, PB&J recovery shakes, PB&J waffles and PB&J pancakes. Bucks team chef/dietitian Shawn Zell won't rule out one day making a PB&J burger.\n\nIt's a tale of two diets in Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, where the Cavs, courtesy of a partnership with fellow Ohio-based outfit Smucker's, foist about a dozen of the company's prepackaged Uncrustables PB&J's on opposing teams every game night. (Both the Lakers' and Celtics' strength and conditioning coaches tell their players to avoid those processed, once-frozen snacks.) But the Cavs fare far better with their fare, serving themselves 20 artisanal PB&J's prior to tip-off, with homemade grape and raspberry jelly, as well as almond butter-and-banana and peanut butter-and-banana sandwiches -- the power of the PB&J being wielded as a form of asymmetric nutritional warfare.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, it's hard to swallow: The NBA is covered in experts, obsessed with peak performance -- and still this pillar of grade-school cafeteria lunches is the staple snack of the league. An exorbitantly wealthy microclique, backed by an army of personal chefs, swears by a sandwich whose standard ingredients boast a street value of roughly 69 cents.\n\nIt was winter of 2013, and those in Dwight Howard's inner orbit begged the All-Star center to kick his addiction, but he denied he had one. Why, he'd dominated for years as the NBA's best big man, carrying the Magic to the Finals in 2009. Then came surgery on a herniated disk in April 2012, followed by an August trade to the Lakers, who had paraded him around like their next Wilt, Kareem or Shaq -- an unstoppable center who would deliver titles in droves. But his back just wasn't healing. Howard was 27, sculpted like a statue in the Louvre, but he labored down the court like a retired fullback. The Lakers plummeted below .500 in January, with Kobe Bryant barking at Howard to man up, though in terms a tad more colorful. But the team's chef and its strength and conditioning coach stressed a different message: \"Man up -- and get off this sugar.\"\n\nBy February's All-Star break, it was time for a full-blown intervention, and Dr. Cate Shanahan, the Lakers' nutritionist, led the charge, speaking to Howard by phone from her office in Napa, California. Howard's legs tingled, he complained, but she noticed he was having trouble catching passes too, as if his hands were wrapped in oven mitts. Well, he quietly admitted, his fingers also tingled. Shanahan, with two decades of experience in the field, knew Howard possessed a legendary sweet tooth, and she suspected his consumption of sugar was causing a nerve dysfunction called dysesthesia, which she'd seen in patients with prediabetes. She urged him to cut back on sugar for two weeks. If that didn't help, she said, she vowed to resign.\n\nTo alter Howard's diet, though, Shanahan first had to understand it. After calls with his bodyguard, chef and a personal assistant, she uncovered a startling fact: Howard had been scarfing down about two dozen chocolate bars' worth of sugar every single day for years, possibly as long as a decade. \"You name it, he ate it,\" she says. Skittles, Starbursts, Rolos, Snickers, Mars bars, Twizzlers, Almond Joys, Kit Kats and oh, how he loved Reese's Pieces. He'd eat them before lunch, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner, and like any junkie, he had stashes all over -- in his kitchen, his bedroom, his car, a fix always within reach. She told his assistants to empty his house, and they hauled out his monstrous candy stash in boxes -- yes, boxes, plural. Howard ultimately vowed to go clean all at once, but before he committed to cutting the junk in his diet, he asked Shanahan one question. It was about one food he wasn't willing to surrender, one snack at which he had to draw the line.\n\nHe wanted to know whether he could still eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\nDiFrancesco was hardly surprised. When he'd joined the Lakers in 2011 and begun traveling around the league, he'd already seen it: Four years after KG's PB&J epiphany, virtually every player's lounge and practice site was stocked with jumbo-sized jars of peanut butter and jelly, bookended by a loaf or two of bread. DiFrancesco had had his eye on improving player diets, but Mount PB&J was clearly not the hill to die upon. \"You pick your battles,\" he says.\n\nWhich is exactly what DiFrancesco told Shanahan as they began working with Howard, in 2013, to overhaul his sugary diet. Their demands weren't onerous: He didn't have to quit cold turkey, they only wanted Howard to try a healthier approach, with soft sourdough, organic peanut butter and low-sugar jelly. Tensions were high when they presented Howard with the healthier version. But as he sank his teeth in, Howard grinned, \"Yeah, this will work.\" Howard, as requested, cut out sugars from his diet. The tingling in his fingers and legs ceased. After the All-Star break, he tallied 1.8 more rebounds, 2.1 more points and 2.5 more minutes per game.\n\nToday, Shanahan accepts what DiFrancesco realized years ago: \"The peanut butter and jelly sandwich is absolutely never going to not be in the NBA. And I feel confident saying never.\"\n\nBut why? What is it, exactly, about a PB&J?\n\nIn dozens of interviews with players, coaches, executives, nutritionists, trainers and others in and around the NBA, the most common explanation offered was the most obvious: PB&J is comfort food, and countless players, like countless other humans, grew up on it. \"It's a soothing memory from childhood,\" Shanahan says. It's \"peace of mind,\" says Brett Singer, a dietitian at the Memorial Hermann Ironman Sports Medicine Institute, who adds: \"You feel good, you play well.\" Brian St. Pierre, director of performance nutrition at Precision Nutrition, who's consulted with the Spurs, says it's not so much a placebo effect but \"almost more than that. They just simply believe.\" Lakers coach Luke Walton has a theory: NBA players are superstitious nuts, especially when it comes to routines. \"Athletes are strange people,\" he says. \"We've got weird habits.\" Walton, now 36 and in his first season leading the Lakers, still downs a PB&J before every game.\n\nFactor in the NBA schedule -- teams flying constantly, red-eyes, bad traffic, rotten night's sleeps -- and on a night-to-night basis, so much is outside a player's control. It's all the more natural to cling all the tighter to something quick, cheap and all but impossible to foul up.\n\nCute theory. But now let's engage in a little evolutionary anthropology and travel back millennia to when humans began to walk upright and our ancestors developed cravings for certain qualities in hard-to-find calorie-dense foods: fats, sugars, starches, proteins and salts. Today, the smell of these -- even the mere awareness of their proximity -- still triggers a release in humans of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which once provided our ancestors with an energy boost for the hunt, along with serotonin, the \"happiness hormone.\" At first bite of a PB&J, receptors detect the food's chemical composition and report back to the brain -- fats! sugars! starches! proteins! salts! -- where reward centers release opioids and, after a few minutes, endorphins, which briefly reduce stress. It's an effect, St. Pierre notes, that's similar to sex. They also lower the body's heart rate, a bonus for an anxious hunter or a player just before tip-off. \"These are the exact same pathways that make heroin addicts chase their next fix,\" says Dr. Trevor Cottrell, director of human performance for the Memorial Hermann Ironman Sports Medicine Institute.\n\nHeroin, sex ... peanut butter and jelly. You can see why players might revolt if someone tried to take away their PB&J. So are they actually good for you -- or good enough for the physical demands of the most physically taxed athletes on the planet? Perhaps you've seen articles in your Facebook feed about the horrors of sugar and carbs. Within that framework, no, PB&J's aren't great. The typical PB&J contains roughly 400 to 500 calories, 50 grams of carbohydrates, 20 grams of fat and 10 grams of protein. As Jill Lane, a Dallas-based sports nutritionist who has worked with NBA players, says: \"It's not the best, but it's not bad.\"\n\nBut nutrition may be beside the point. \"Even if we argue that physiologically a PB&J isn't the 'best' pregame meal,\" St. Pierre says, \"that's only true if you think psychology doesn't impact physiology, and we know it does. Your thoughts about a food will actually help to shape how your body reacts to that food.\" As Stephan J. Guyenet, author of The Hungry Brain, notes, \"The brain mostly cares about calories, so plain celery sticks and kale don't release much dopamine and we don't develop cravings for them.\" Or as Cottrell says: \"The brain is a complex organ system that we know very little about. But what we know [about food cravings] alludes to some important neural pathways that are often associated with crack cocaine addiction, believe it or not.\"\n\nMake that heroin, sex ... and crack cocaine.\n\nThe mutinous undertones for the Warriors appeared in October 2015, on the team's first flight of the season. In the prior offseason, the Warriors had hired Lachlan Penfold, former head of physical preparation for an Australian men's rugby squad, to man a newly created position: head of physical performance and sports medicine. Penfold arrived in the Bay Area with a simple vision: less sugar, healthier food. The Warriors, in turn, had willingly parted with candy, cookies and soda. But now, on this charter flight, they found nary a PB&J. Concerned glances were exchanged. \"Just the fact that it wasn't there shook me a little bit,\" Stephen Curry told ESPN at the time. Clearly, Penfold had made a mistake, yes? No. \"Sorry, mate,\" Penfold explained then. \"We're not doing sugar.\" History records this sinister act as the first shot fired in the Great PB&J War of 2015.\n\n\u0093Athletes are strange people. We've got weird habits.\u0094\n\n- Luke Walton\n\nWalton, at the time the interim coach for an injured Steve Kerr, decided to lead the revolt. Perhaps in an effort to ingratiate himself with his new charges, whenever Walton was asked by flight attendants in the coming weeks, \"Coach, what can we get you?\" he'd reply, without fail, in a voice loud enough that Penfold and his players could all hear, \"Peanut butter and jelly!\" Walton would be duly informed that no such option was available. But his message was clear. This would not stand. Said Penfold at the time: \"I haven't heard [complaining] like that since my youngest daughter was about 3 years of age.\"\n\nAs the Warriors' PB&J ban persisted, Walton upped the stakes: He began telling flight attendants he wanted PB&J ... or nothing. Then on Dec. 11, after the Warriors beat the Celtics in double overtime to improve to an NBA-record 24-0, players again asked for PB&J for the flight to Milwaukee on the second night of a back-to-back. Again, Penfold said no. \"Who needs peanut butter and jelly when you've got Vegemite?\" Penfold joked at the time, referencing a famously distasteful Australian food spread. The following night, the Warriors lost to the Bucks. \"I have to believe we lost a game because of it,\" Warriors GM Bob Myers said then, tongue firmly in cheek -- perhaps stuck to the roof of his mouth. \"I think you can trace it to the peanut butter.\"\n\nFinally, Walton called in the heavy artillery: Curry, the MVP guard. The sharpshooter had become a PB&J devotee during the 2014-15 season, when, during one halftime, Curry complained of hunger and the team's strength and conditioning coach whipped one up. From then on, Curry's PB&J (for the record: Smucker's strawberry, Skippy creamy) became his go-to pregame meal. \"If you look at Steph's warm-up, some of it is sensical, some of it doesn't make sense,\" Myers said. \"But if peanut butter and jelly are part of our routine, to take that away from him, it was actually an irresponsible thing to do from the outset.\" It was time for Walton to fire back: He explained to Curry that if the guard entered the fray, they'd win this war. \"Once Steph got on board,\" Walton says, \"we got them back pretty quickly after that.\"\n\nPenfold relented: \"A peanut butter and jelly sandwich every now and again wouldn't kill them. I wouldn't eat it, but you know, whatever turns you on, you know?\"\n\n\"Catastrophe avoided,\" Myers said.\n\nToday, Penfold is no longer employed by the Warriors. Last October it was reported that he'd joined the Melbourne Storm, an Australian rugby league team, as the new director of performance. No formal announcement ever appears to have been made explaining what led to his departure from the Warriors, after their 73-win season. One can assume it was not because of sandwiches. But last February, Walton was quoted by The Wall Street Journal, defending his battle and proclaiming victory for the common man over the forces of anti-PB&J tyranny: \"You gotta fight for your rights. If you believe in something, you gotta fight for it.\"\n\nIn the aftermath, when Walton was named coach of the Lakers last summer, he was approached by DiFrancesco, who also helps shape the Lakers' pregame and postgame meals. DiFrancesco asked Walton whether there was any specific item that Walton wanted on the team plane after games.\n\n\"Nope, your call,\" Walton told him. \"I'm sure you do a great job. But ... there better be PB&J's.\"\n\nIt's late January, midday, at a shared workspace along Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, and NBA commissioner Adam Silver has a plane to catch. He's leaving a panel discussion at the second annual Total Health Forum, hosted by the league and its partner, health giant Kaiser Permanente, and there's a crowd waiting.\n\nSilver, in a red tie and black suit, shakes a slew of hands, smiles for a few selfies and, as the minutes become precious, disappears through a doorway into the back. He removes a microphone affixed to his jacket, then meets a reporter, who warns Silver that what's coming next are serious questions for a serious story. Silver agrees to be grilled, and the two walk and talk. And then Silver is asked: What is the league's official stance on the very obvious peanut butter and jelly epidemic in NBA locker rooms?\n\n\"Our official stance,\" Silver says, \"is that it is a healthy snack.\"\n\nAnd then he stops. Clearly, Silver recognizes that this subject is not one to be discussed in passing. These questions must be given his full attention, even if he's on a tight schedule, with a plane to catch.\n\n\"Let's talk,\" he says.\n\nIn Golden State last year, the reporter notes, a sports scientist wanted to do away with the snack, sugars and all that -- and the players revolted. The players won. So you have the health community vs. the players. Whose side are you on? \"Well, so where I fall is I listen to Chris Paul, our first speaker this morning,\" Silver says. \"He talked about balance. So I'm an advocate of balance. So people need to eat nutritious meals, but a little bit of sugar ... OK.\"\n\nBut is allowing a little bit a slippery slope?\n\n\"No, because my response to any slippery slope is you draw lines.\"\n\nFinally, the crucial query is broached: How do you take yours, Adam Silver? And where do you fall in the grape vs. strawberry debate?\n\n\"I'm clearly on the strawberry side of the debate,\" Silver says, with some measure of emphasis, as if selecting grape is indefensible. \"And I take, usually, my peanut butter with toast in the morning. I've been going light on the jelly. I do peanut butter virtually every day. I don't always add the jelly.\"\n\nGrowing up in Latvia, Knicks sensation Kristaps Porzingis had never heard of a PB&J. Then he joined the NBA. \"I fell in love,\" he told The Wall Street Journal. Pacers nutritionist Lindsay Langford says rookie Georges Niang begs -- yes, begs -- for her PB&J recovery-shake recipe (frozen blueberries, vanilla whey protein, creamy peanut butter and milk), which she makes, once a week, to his delight. Warriors forward Kevin Durant is such a fan that he worked with Nike to unveil a PB&J-colored sneaker. His ex-teammate Russell Westbrook prefers a pregame marriage of Skippy and strawberry jelly between toasted wheat bread, halved sometimes, depending on his mood, with butter slathered on the inside.\n\nThen there's Lakers 19-year-old rookie forward Brandon Ingram, who, before road games, carefully inspects his team's PB&J's, each made with organic ingredients, to make sure they're up to his standards. Ingram, a jelly-come-lately, says he began eating pregame PB&J's only about two years ago. But when he arrived in the NBA and found the habit leaguewide, he knew he'd found a home. \"Brandon has the highest requisites,\" DiFrancesco says, \"on what constitutes a perfect PB&J for any player I've ever come across.\"\n\nIngram, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2016 draft, self-identifies as a \"big grape jelly lover\" and demands a healthy spread of peanut butter on the inside of both slices of bread, and if he doesn't see jelly poking out on at least two sides of the sandwich, he's got serious concerns. Ask him to name a place where the PB&J was lacking and he doesn't hesitate. \"Utah,\" he says. \"Not enough jelly.\"\n\nBrandon Ingram might not realize that he's inherited a legacy. He might not know that he's but one soldier in a decadelong war. But Celtics trainer Doo knows. He knows that the legend they speak of is real. He knows there is a Johnny Appleseed of the PB&J revolution.\n\nAnd he knows where to find him.\n\nAnd so it was that during a January visit to Atlanta, when Doo stopped by the TNT studios, he saw, as part of a skit for TNT's new Area 21 show, several NBA greats sitting together to dine: There was Shaquille O'Neal, feasting on barbecued chicken. There was Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas, enjoying a steak.\n\nAnd Kevin Garnett? Well, come on, you know what was on his plate.\n\nFood styling by Abby Stolfo\n\nBaxter HolmesHolmes is a senior NBA writer for ESPN.",

    "raw_text": "Just after dawn, in the middle of a relapse last winter, a fleet of dark SUVs rolled up and took Randy Gregory away. He was half-awake and had been partying the night before, so his recollection of the details probably isn't exact. He remembers about 15 men, most of them clad in dark suits. They looked like the feds.\n\nThe men worked swiftly, ushering him into one of the SUVs bound for the airport. They did not give him time to pack.\n\nGregory, once a promising defensive end for the Dallas Cowboys, had spent the better part of 2017 underground. He had been suspended from the NFL for repeatedly violating the league's substance abuse policy, was still smoking pot and had very little chance of ever returning to the NFL. In early December 2017, he sent a text to his lawyer:\n\n\" ... I'm a 25-year-old pro athlete with no friends. No income/job. Can't make my own decisions or go as I please. Have to check in with everyone for approval ...\"\n\nHe couldn't go home because his relationship with his soon-to-be ex was disintegrating, and he couldn't be with his 2-year-old daughter, Sophia, the one perfect thing in his life. He could not see his coaches or hang out in the locker room because NFL rules prohibited him from being in the facility.\n\nHe had taken his belongings and moved into the Hyatt House, an extended-stay hotel four minutes away from the Cowboys' headquarters. He would sit at the hotel bar, drink Coronas and wonder what could have been. He had lost roughly 40 pounds from his 6-foot-6 frame, making him look more like a shooting guard than an NFL player. One day, a bartender asked whether he was a ballplayer, and Gregory flashed an embarrassed smile. He didn't really know who he was.\n\nHis lawyer, Daniel Moskowitz, had been on his case to check into a rehab clinic in Southern California. Moskowitz booked flights, but Gregory resisted. Moskowitz tried the good cop route first, sending texts saying encouraging things like, \"You're better than this, Randy.\" But eventually, the words devolved to, \"You're f---ing going!\"\n\nMoskowitz watched from a distance when the men in the dark SUVs came for Gregory. Moskowitz will not say who they were. \"I made an extreme call,\" he says, \"and the cavalry came.\"\n\n\"The cavalry\" took Gregory to a flight to California, where he spent more than six months in a rehab center and a sober-living house. He acknowledged his addiction and mental-health issues and worked to get sober. Today, he is back in the NFL, on a Cowboys team surging toward the postseason.\n\nMoskowitz says Gregory is a great American comeback story. \"It's f---ing 'Rudy' on steroids,\" he says. But for now, let's take his four sacks, 15 tackles and the sight of him exploding off the edge for what it is, a hopeful start. Gregory's story isn't just about where he has been; it's where he still has to go.\n\nTonight, he will go home, to his apartment near the Cowboys' facility, and he'll probably run into his accountability partner, who lives with him. Gregory will be drug tested frequently this month, possibly as many as 10 times. His status as an active NFL player is tenuous. Another slip-up and everything could be gone.\n\nThe first time Randy Gregory tried marijuana, he was a senior in high school. He'd skipped a basketball practice shootaround, gathered with a bunch of giggling teenagers and took a hit. They went to McDonald's afterward, to cure the munchies, but Gregory realized that he was not high or even buzzed. He didn't feel a thing.\n\nHe tried it again a week later, with much different results. \"I was stuck standing,\" he says. \"I felt like if I moved, I was going to float away.\"\n\nHe eventually found comfort in that feeling, of things slowing down. He would eventually smoke marijuana by himself, believing it made him feel more normal.\n\nFrom the outside, \"normal\" is a word that could be used to describe Gregory's childhood. He grew up in a supportive home, with a mother who ran pass drills with him in the yard and a father who played football at Northwestern. Ken Gregory went on to a successful business-consulting career in the medical field, and the only downside to his promotions was that it meant the family was often on the move.\n\nThey shuffled to Alabama and Florida and Tennessee and Ohio and Missouri and Indiana, and oftentimes when Randy walked into a new classroom, he didn't see many kids who looked like him. Each place carried a common theme: That Gregory didn't fit in.\n\nThe move to Ohio was particularly hard. He was about 8 years old. He wanted to look good for his first day in school, so he got a haircut at a barbershop. The clippers gave him an infection that left a large bald spot in the back of his head. And when he sat at his desk, he could hear the children behind him, laughing. He couldn't understand how the same kids who picked him for football at recess, because he was good, would turn around and tease him and beat him up later.\n\n\"They would do things that would affect me physically and mentally,\" Gregory says. \"I wasn't always 6-6. I was always taught to defend myself, but I was never one to look for trouble. I never understood why kids would mess with me.\"\n\nYears later, a doctor at one of the treatment centers Gregory attended as an adult would say that Gregory experienced post-traumatic stress disorder from the bullying. He also has dealt with self-esteem issues, depression, anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nHis father did not know that he was struggling. \"The funny thing about him,\" Ken Gregory says, \"is that he was so good at everything he did.\" Randy was smart. He procrastinated, sure, but he always got by. Every sport he played, he was a natural. He would pick up a golf club and hit it better than any adult in Ken's foursome. He won the first wrestling meet he ever competed in when he was 8 or 9. It was at that meet that Ken got a glimpse of Randy's struggles.\n\n\"He'd been presented his trophy,\" Ken says, \"and we were in the locker room, just me and him. And he kind of had what I would describe as a panic attack. And it baffled me. I was like, 'Son, it's OK, you don't have to worry about this anymore. You won.' Years later I look back on that day saying, 'Was that the first sign that he was really struggling with some anxiety?'\n\n\"You question yourself. What could I have done better? What did I miss? You question everything.\"\n\nThe bullying abated by eighth grade when the Gregorys moved to Fishers, Indiana, a fast-growing suburb of Indianapolis. A growth spurt made Randy bigger and stronger, and the change of scenery offered a clean slate. The kids at Hamilton Southeastern High School didn't know about the bald spot, the torment or his fragile confidence. Gregory could dunk a basketball and terrify quarterbacks. How could he not exude confidence?\n\nGregory was tardy a lot, especially his senior year. In 2011, he signed a letter of intent to play at Purdue, about an hour away from his new hometown. His SAT scores were good enough; his grades weren't. \"Senioritis,\" he'd later tell a reporter doing a pre-draft story on him. Gregory would have to go the junior college route, to Arizona Western College. He was on the move again.\n\nBefore he left for Yuma, Gregory decided he would stop smoking pot. He was going to college now, his future was right in front of him, and he needed to focus on his grades and football. But once again, he did not fit in.\n\nMany of his teammates did not have a mom who played football in the yard or a dad with a job that could keep his family in the suburbs. Some of his teammates were, well, pretty rough characters. They came from rough backgrounds.\n\n\"It was like I'm too proper for the black kids and too black for the white kids,\" Gregory says. \"It was a different breed of guys, and a lot of times there I would be smoking by myself just to kind of get away from people.\"\n\nHe had nine sacks his freshman season and helped take the Matadors to the national championship game. Though he broke his leg the following season, the University of Nebraska's interest didn't wane.\n\nGregory arrived in Lincoln in August 2013. His first time on the field, the Cornhuskers ran a five-man blitz, and the offense completed a slant pass on a hot read. Gregory was dropping into the boundary, chased down the ball and caught the receiver. Nebraska's coaches looked at each other in wonderment.\n\nThey went up to Gregory and told him that it was a hell of a play. An NFL play.\n\n\"He looked at us like that was what he was supposed to do,\" says former Nebraska defensive line coach Rick Kaczenski. \"I don't think he understands he can do things that other people can't do.\"\n\nKaczenski calls Gregory a once-in-every-20-years talent -- fast, explosive and unbelievably fluid for a 6-6 frame. And he was tough, Kaczenski says, playing through the 2014 Holiday Bowl with a knee injury, turf toe and a sinus infection.\n\nGregory picked up the Huskers' defense so fast that first season that he led the Big Ten with 10\u00bd sacks. He also reportedly failed two drug tests while he was there. But that would not be a deal-breaker when Gregory decided forgo his senior season to enter the 2015 NFL draft.\n\nLet's face it: Young men, including young football players in the NFL, smoke marijuana. In a 2016 ESPN NFL Nation confidential survey, nearly a quarter of those polled said they knew of an NFL player who smoked marijuana before a game.\n\nGregory says he smoked every day during his pre-draft training in Atlanta, and he wasn't alone. One of his NFL-bound training buddies smoked right along with him. Gregory was making around $6,000 a week, and how cool was that, getting paid to work out? \"I'm thinking I'm like a big baller,\" he says. He would wake up at 6 a.m., train and be finished at noon. He'd go to the mall and smoke the rest of the day.\n\nHe and his friend, who Gregory won't name, got some solid advice: They needed to stop smoking a month away from the combine to avoid testing positive. The friend stopped at the one-month mark. Gregory decided to push it a little and waited an extra three or four days. His friend did not test positive for marijuana. Gregory did.\n\nAnd so started the pothead jokes and the smoke-filled memes. He was hurt by the critics who called him stupid and annoyed by the ones who suggested that he actually blazed up during the combine. (He said he didn't smoke at the combine.) He is convinced that the positive test isn't what turned teams off. No, Gregory believes a pre-draft questionnaire did him in. It asked whether he had ever been depressed or thought about killing himself. Gregory checked \"yes\" for both.\n\n\"I was honest about it,\" Gregory says. \"There are teams that took me off their board because they're like, 'This kid's not here.' Or he's got issues.\"\n\nHe acknowledges that he made some bad first impressions, like the missed interview with the Oakland Raiders because he fell asleep at the airport gate. He headed to his next stop, San Diego, but his luggage headed to Oakland. The Chargers gave him some clothes to wear, and in hindsight, it probably wasn't a good idea to show up for the next interview in Arizona wearing Chargers gear.\n\nThe mock drafts that projected him so high had him plummeting now. Some teams took him off their boards.\n\n\"You could tell he's a big marijuana guy,\" says one NFL decision-maker who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"He couldn't stay focused. His eyes were everywhere. And I felt bad for him. ... But I would not draft the guy no matter what after I got done with the interview.\n\n\"The tape said yes; the interview said no.\"\n\nDespite the free fall, Gregory insisted on attending the draft in Chicago. Ken and Mary Gregory accompanied their son. He was the last one in the green room. At 9:09 p.m., as the first night of the draft wound down, Gregory sent a text to Cowboys coach Jason Garrett.\n\nGregory felt as if he had connected with the Cowboys. In the weeks before the draft, he had a heart-to-heart talk with owner Jerry Jones.\n\n\"He cried,\" Gregory says. \"He said, 'I know what it's like to be publicly scrutinized.'\"\n\nDallas selected him the following day in the second round, with the 60th overall pick. Gregory says the coaches printed out the text he'd sent Garrett on draft night and have reminded him about it over the years.\n\n\"... I learned from this,\" the text said. \"I know players say things like this all the time, but with everything going on, I can really see how this can all go away in a minute. ... I know you can help me be great. Please believe in me!\"\n\nGregory wanted to live up to his pledge. He flashed great promise at the start of his rookie year. He had three sacks in the preseason, and on opening day against the New York Giants, he applied pressure to Eli Manning three times in just 18 snaps. But he suffered a high-ankle sprain in the fourth quarter, was out for a month and did not look the same upon his return.\n\nHe didn't record his first tackle until week 10 of the 2015 season. He was not one to open up about his disappointment.\n\n\"I don't want people worrying about me,\" he says. \"If I'm in a f---ed-up mood, I want to be in a f---ed-up mood by myself. That's where the isolation comes into effect. It probably doesn't help.\"\n\nIn February 2016, Gregory was suspended four games for violating the league's drug policy. He failed another drug test a couple of months later and was suspended 10 more games. In November 2016 came another failed test. This time, he was facing at least a yearlong ban.\n\nDr. Vernon Williams, director of the Center for Sports Neurology & Pain Management at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles, says that young adulthood is often a time when depression and anxiety emerge. Williams says that young professional athletes also face many mental health stressors such as new financial responsibility, travel, disordered sleep and intense scrutiny on social media.\n\n\"They often have pain because of injuries, so there's kind of this perfect storm in that period of life where they may be subject to emotional and psychological issues,\" Williams says, \"and it's right at the same time when there's this increased availability of marijuana. Most people use it in the company of others, so it's kind of a personal storm.\"\n\nBut Williams, who also is the team neurologist for the Los Angeles Rams, says that marijuana can actually exacerbate mental health symptoms. Street-use marijuana, he says, often contains higher levels of THC, which \"can contribute to cognitive impairment, it can contribute to other mental-status changes and possibly contribute to anxiety. There's a mixed picture there,\" Williams says, \"and a potential for depression, as well.\"\n\nGregory had previously tried to quit drugs during his NFL banishment. He went to a renowned rehab clinic in Texas in the summer of 2017. He was stripped of his cellphone -- he needed to get rid of the bad influences in his life -- and was handed a flip phone. He was an inpatient with a number and placed in the Professionals In Crisis program. He estimates that he was the youngest person in the group.\n\nGregory was supposed to make $781,813 in base salary that year. He was in Texas, but a planet away from football. For as many keyboard critics who belittled Gregory, none of them was as critical as Gregory was on himself. He did not think he would ever play again. He did not think he was deserving of happiness.\n\nStill, lawyers and agents would call Gregory's parents, offering their services. Gregory didn't want to spend what little money he had on an attorney, and he certainly didn't trust any of them.\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Moskowitz reached out to the Gregorys. And by that summer, Moskowitz had his first meeting with Gregory in a mall in Houston.\n\n\"He had a level of confidence about him,\" Gregory's father says of Moskowitz. \"It was almost like he was saying, 'I know I can do this. I can't promise you anything. The only thing I can promise is that I'll work my tail off to make it happen.'\"\n\nDaniel Moskowitz has dealt with anxiety and fear. He has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, goes days without sleeping and thrives in chaos. In the spring of 2017, he got Arizona Cardinals linebacker Daryl Washington reinstated after a three-year suspension from repeated violations of the NFL's drug policy. Growing up as one of the only Jewish people in Marion, Virginia, Moskowitz says he understands what it's like to feel different.\n\nGregory was in the middle of a rehab stint when he met Moskowitz. \"Look, man, I'm going to be straight up,\" Gregory told Moskowitz. \"If you f--- this up, my mom's gonna kill you.\"\n\nMoskowitz showed up at the treatment facility nearly every day with fast food. If visiting hours ended in 20 minutes, he would stay two hours. They would develop an unconventional attorney-client relationship, bickering like a married couple, with Moskowitz becoming invested in Gregory's recovery.\n\nExample No. 1: When Gregory started spiraling in late 2017, he asked Moskowitz to stay with him because he didn't want to be alone.\n\nAgent Blake Baratz calls Moskowitz \"diligent,\" \"passionate\" and a \"savant.\" The NFL's substance abuse policy is complicated, Baratz says, and can leave offenders feeling isolated and abandoned.\n\n\"[Moskowitz] sees something wrong and he wants to fix it,\" Baratz says. \"I just think [with people] like Randy, when they get to the point when they're suspended a year or two years, and they have to follow all these rules and regulations, they don't really have anyone guiding them that's experienced in the drug program, that's experienced in the legal side of things. So they kind of get abandoned.\n\n\"If you've got a guy who's smoking weed every day and all of a sudden you take away the one constant in their life, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to say, 'Well, he's probably not going to get out of that rut.'\"\n\nWhen Gregory completed his 2017 Texas rehab stint, he had so much anxiety that he was shaking on the drive back to Dallas. \"He was very scared to go back,\" Moskowitz says.\n\nOne of the first things Gregory needed was structure. He took a marketing job at Genesco Sports Enterprises. One day, Gregory made an attempt to bond with his coworkers by offering to pick up the tab for their drinks. When he went to pay, his card was declined.\n\nEverything in his life seemed to be a failure. He had no money and no hope, and he became consumed with negative thoughts.\n\n\"I was just in a real bad place,\" Gregory says.\n\nMoskowitz had one request for Gregory: If he started smoking again, please tell him. But by December, Gregory wasn't just smoking marijuana. He was out of control.\n\nThis time, Gregory had a support system to guide him. He wouldn't just go to inpatient treatment for 60 days and then leave and hope that it took. He'd have safeguards to help ensure his sobriety. He'd move into a sober-living house and go to daily meetings and psychotherapy sessions.\n\nHe admitted he was an addict, and put his fears and regrets down on paper. He estimated that he'd lost millions, and regretted that he wasn't the father he knew he could be.\n\nInspiration sometimes comes from unexpected places, and one of the people who had a big impact on Gregory in California was Mike Ornstein.\n\nOrnstein, who was at the center of the Reggie Bush extra-benefits scandal, told him that life is not defined by the mistakes you make but by the people who you help.\n\nThere is symmetry in the fact that Ornstein and Gregory's agent, Steve Weinberg, helped get him back in the league. Weinberg was decertified and barred by the NFLPA for about a decade. And now here they were, two guys cast away from the NFL, helping Gregory's comeback.\n\nWhile Gregory was in Los Angeles, Moskowitz put together a 2,000-page petition for reinstatement. The paperwork filled six boxes. In June, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell granted them a meeting in New York.\n\nThe meeting was supposed to be at 1 p.m., and Gregory and Moskowitz were supposed to meet in the hotel lobby at noon. Moskowitz wasn't there, so Gregory went up to Moskowitz's room.\n\n\"He was sitting in front of his laptop,\" Gregory says, \"with just underwear on, no T-shirt, s--- everywhere in the room, earplugs on. I was like, 'We gotta go, man.'\"\n\nSomehow, they made it in time. The meeting lasted about two hours.\n\nA month after their meeting, Moskowitz was at a Jamba Juice eating an acai bowl when he got an email. Gregory had been conditionally reinstated. Moskowitz dropped the acai bowl all over the floor, and ran out to the parking lot and screamed with glee. He cried when he called Gregory.\n\nThe guy who was never supposed to play in the NFL again was going to the Cowboys' training camp in Oxnard, California.\n\n\"In Randy's case, our eyes were wide open with some of the issues he had when we drafted him,\" Jason Garrett told reporters during training camp this past summer. \"We were committed to providing a structure around him that would hopefully help him address some of those issues and eventually be a really good player for us and be a great citizen on our team and in our community.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the NFL declined to comment for this story, saying the league does not discuss specific players because of confidentiality provisions in the drug policy. In September, ESPN's Adam Schefter wrote that the NFL has become more tolerant when a player violates the drug policy, emphasizing treatment and support rather than discipline. When asked about this via email, the NFL spokesperson did not respond. Would the NFL punish the Cowboys if they were connected to \"the cavalry,\" even if it might have saved Gregory's life? Dallas owner Jerry Jones declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\nIt was opening day of the 2018 NFL season and everyone was excited. Children with sparkly stars on their hats were roughhousing in the lobby of an upscale hotel in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Cowboys were in town to play the Panthers, and here was the best thing yet: Randy Gregory was going to play football in a regular-season game for the first time in 616 days. He brought a freshly pressed suit jacket and tan pants for the bus ride over to Bank of America Stadium.\n\nMoskowitz took a seat in the hotel restaurant and ordered a breakfast befitting a man who represents legally challenged players -- a pot of coffee and a diet Red Bull.\n\nSometime after 10 a.m., old highlights of Gregory flashed on a TV, and then came breaking news from ESPN's Schefter: Gregory had relapsed, sources said. He could face discipline.\n\nMoskowitz's phone immediately blew up with texts from reporters. He ignored them for a call with Mary Gregory.\n\n\"Have you been crying?\" he asked her.\n\n\"Mrs. Gregory, don't cry. He's going to make it.\"\n\nGregory says he did not fail a drug test. Relapse, in Randy Gregory's ultra-controlled world, does not necessarily mean he did drugs. It could mean he skipped a treatment plan or missed a drug test. Gregory's camp won't comment on exactly what happened, but he has not been suspended for any of the Cowboys' 12 games.\n\nHe did play in the game against the Panthers, but his debut was over before halftime. He collided with teammate DeMarcus Lawrence and suffered a concussion.\n\nCowboys defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli says the plan was to wean Gregory back this season. In some ways, he was more behind than the rookies. He was not at OTAs and hadn't played in a game since 2016. He also had his knee scoped in October.\n\nThe Cowboys have needed him, and he has been a disruptive force on a defensive line that is considered one of the best in the NFL. He had three sacks in a four-game stretch. On Thanksgiving against the Washington Redskins, Gregory was in such an intense battle with Pro Bowl tackle Trent Williams that Williams wound up in the hospital with a bruised rib.\n\nDefensive ends often rate their happiness and success on the number of sacks they have, and when Gregory brought down Blake Bortles in a win against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Oct. 14, his confidence soared. It was his first sack since 2016.\n\nCowboys defensive tackle Maliek Collins, who roomed with Gregory at Nebraska, says Gregory seems more comfortable with himself now.\n\n\"Seeing him back is a testament to his hard work,\" Collins says, \"and the things he had to do to get better.\"\n\nGregory is eating steak and fried rice at the Shoji Sushi and Hibachi in Frisco, Texas, 6 miles away from the Hyatt House where he used to live. It's a festive night -- it's always festive when shrimp is flying -- and every 20 minutes or so the drums beat for someone's birthday.\n\nMoskowitz and his boss at Gordon & Rees, Bob Bragalone, are seated at the table. Bragalone is called \"Cowboy Bob\" because he has one of the world's largest collections of Cowboys memorabilia. Moskowitz is wearing one of Gregory's sweatshirts, and the blue hoodie hangs down to his legs.\n\nA guy stops at the table and asks for an autograph, and it seems to make Gregory happy. It's affirmation that he's back and that people know who he is: a ballplayer.\n\n\"Some people consider my life boring,\" Gregory says. \"I don't. It's what keeps me out of trouble. I see how hard it was before, and I see how easy it can be for me now. Go to practice, come home, hang out. My day's pretty simple.\"\n\nFor now, he is back on the field. It hasn't been perfect, of course. Progress never is. Thursday night, in one of the biggest games of the season against New Orleans, Gregory was flagged for three crucial second-half penalties. Twitter erupted, fans were livid, but the Cowboys still won, and, like most things, the outrage quelled and people moved on. After the game, Gregory did not talk to reporters. He wanted to clear his head, so he got in his car and took a drive. He loves driving because it represents freedom. He drove past the stadium lights and the leaves turning brown.\n\nJerry Jones and Jason Garrett spoke in support of Gregory. They're not giving up on him. The calendar turned to December, the one year-anniversary of Gregory hitting rock bottom. Maybe the penalties seemed smaller. Randy Gregory is playing football again. He's drawing a paycheck, and fighting to stay clean. It's December, and there's hope.\n\nElizabeth MerrillMerrill is a senior writer in ESPN's features and enterprise unit.

    "raw_text": "A record-breaking Paralympic Games came to an end for India on Sunday, and what a memorable 10 days it was. Beginning with Avani Lekhara's gold medal on the shooting range and ending with Navdeep's javelin gold, everything in between was historic too, as India's para-athletes scripted the country's greatest Paralympics campaign ever.\n\nPARALYMPICS 2024 KEY DATES | EVERY MEDAL WON BY INDIA AT THE PARALYMPICS | PARALYMPIC CLASSIFICATIONS EXPLAINED | PARIS PARALYMPICS MEDAL TALLY\n\nThis is India's story at the Paris Paralympics, as told by the numbers:\n\n7-9-13\n\nSeven gold medals, more than ever before. 29 medals, ten more than ever before. Records were shattered. Incredible stories were told. From India's perspective, Paris 2024 will long be remembered for the exploits of its para athletes.\n\n18\n\nIndia finished in the top 20 of the medals tally, and barely just missed out on the top 15. India were one gold away from 15th, while Spain is above India with just two more silver medals.\n\n1\n\nThere were various firsts in the Paralympics for India. Sheetal Devi and Rakesh Kumar in the mixed team event won India's first Paralympic medal in recurve archery. Kapil Parmar was the first Indian Paralympic medallist in judo, Harvinder Singh won the country's first gold in para archery as well.\n\nAlso, Hokato Hotozhe Sema, on debut at this stage, became the first Paralympian from Nagaland, while also becoming the first medallist from his state, in the men's shot put F57.\n\n3\n\nAvani Lekhara (gold in women's 10m Air Rifle SH1) and Mariyappan Thangavelu (bronze in men's high jump T63) won the third Paralympics medals of their respective careers, as many as any other Indian in history. Only Joginder Singh Bedi and Devendra Jhajharia had won three medals before Paris.\n\n3.05\n\nFor Navdeep to even be in contention for a gold medal, he needed to considerably better his personal best in the men's javelin F41 final. He did just that, by flinging the javelin 3.05m further than he ever has. Talk about bringing your best to the biggest stage. Eventually, he stood on the top step of the podium, with a little bit of help from his Iranian rival's disqualification.\n\n4\n\nThere were four events in Paris with two Indians on the podium.\n\nDharambir and Pranav Soorma finished first and second in the men's club throw F51. Mona Agarwal finished in third in the same event that Avani won gold in. Sharad Kumar and Mariyappan Thangavelu finished second and third in the men's high jump T63, while Thulasimathi M and Manisha Ramadass also finished second and third in the women's singles SU5 badminton.\n\n7\n\nPraveen Kumar came into the men's high jump T64 final with the third highest personal best in the field. Seven jumps later, he had won gold. He had cleared seven heights in just one attempt each, including the gold-medal winning height of 2.08m. His failures at 2.10m didn't matter, because by then he'd upgraded his Tokyo silver to a Paris gold.\n\n10\n\n10 Indian para athletes became multiple Paralympic medallists in Paris, led by the sensational Sumit Antil. Harvinder Singh, Praveen Kumar, Suhas Yathiraj, Nishad Kumar, Sharad Kumar, Manish Narwal, Yogesh Kathuniya, Sundar Singh Gurjar all followed up medals in Tokyo with another in Paris, while Preethi Pal won two bronze medals here in Paris.\n\nThere were also 10 female medallists from the Indian contingent, who won 11 medals between them.\n\n24.75\n\nAfter 6 races in 4 days, it all came down to the women's 200m T12 final for Simran to leave Paris with a medal that she so richly deserved, having come up just short (by 0.05s) in the 100m final. Eventually, she won bronze in style, with a personal best time of 24.75s.\n\n1 with 2\n\nOn Paralympics debut, Preethi Pal was the only Indian para athlete to win multiple medals in Paris. She won bronze medals in both the 100m and 200m T35 events.\n\n70.59\n\nSumit Antil had a stunning night in Tokyo three years ago, when he broke the world record three times. Since then, he's that world record of his further up. He couldn't quite match that in Paris, but he breached his Tokyo mark three times here in Paris, with a best throw of 70.59m to set a new Paralympic record.\n\n249.7\n\nAvani Lekhara defended her gold medal in the women's 10m air rifle SH1 category, and on the way to it, she broke her own Paralympic record that she set in Tokyo. Avani finished with a total of 249.7, which won her gold thanks to a poor shot from her Korean rival (who had been leading until then), who shot a 6.8 with her final shot.",

The defending champions got off to a slow start, winning just one of their first four games, but swiftly turned things around to remain unbeaten in their next 13.\n\nAlong the way, they've claimed a streak of records, scoured a couple of big wins and have their men leading the standings on numerous parameters.\n\nHere are the numbers that define Jaipur Pink Panthers' extraordinary PKL S10 campaign:\n\n1\n\nFirst team to qualify for the PKL S10 playoffs. That too with five games in hand - that's making a statement. They lost two of their first four games...and have not lost a single match since.\n\n13\n\nGames unbeaten [and counting!] - the longest unbeaten streak in the history of the PKL. The reigning champions have been unbeaten since December 17 - a run that includes 11 victories and two ties.\n\n4\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers won each of their four home matches - the only team to do that this season. That included a tense win over Puneri Paltan to snap their eight-game winning spree and a thrilling triumph over U Mumba in what was the 1001st PKL match.\n\n7\n\nHigh 5s for Jaipur Pink Panthers' ace defender Ankush Rathee. The left corner defender got off to a slow start this season and the expectations of him were sky-high, especially since he was last season's #1 defender. The youngster took his time before finding his groove and has firmly established his reputation as one of the most lethal defenders on the mat.\n\n10\n\nThe two-time PKL champions retained 10 players ahead of the season - which pretty much included their starting 7. For example, all seven players who started in their comprehensive win over Tamil Thalaivas on Wednesday were retained players. Among them, Iranian defender Reza Mirbagheri has stepped up this season and finds himself among the top 15 defenders.\n\n11\n\nSuper 10s for Arjun Deshwal, the most of PKL10. He's by far been THE most consistent raider this time around. There have been matches where he's been kept off the mat for 10 out of the first 20 minutes, but come the second half, there's simply no stopping Arjun.\n\n191\n\nRaid points for Arjun Deshwal. Last season's MVP has not missed a beat this season, easing himself to the top of the best raider list of the season. That also explains why he wears that green sleeve on his right arm.\n\n507\n\nTotal points conceded by the defending champs - which is the second-lowest among the 12 teams. Most of their matches have been low-scoring contests that typically end with a Super 10 for Arjun or a High 5 for Ankush.",

    "raw_text": "Aman Sehrawat was the sole male Indian wrestler at the Paris Olympics but he carried the pressure of expectation with his trademark calm and employed his mercurial footwork to beat Darian Toi Cruz 13-5 for the bronze medal in the men's 57kg category. With this he became, at 21, the youngest Indian Olympic medallist ever in individual sport (beating PV Sindhu's record).\n\nIt's also a sign that Indian wrestling, which has been through turbulent times outside of the mat, has a bright future on it. Aman's potential had been spotted early as he tore through the age-group circuits before graduating to senior competitions two years ago.\n\nLIVE BLOG: AUGUST 14 | INDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nAfter two easy wins on Thursday to start his campaign, Aman - the youngest male freestyle wrestler at the Paris Olympics - rode out a spirited first period from Cruz to eventually win comfortably.\n\nAman had a clear brief from his coach Lalit Kumar before the bout: don't be dheela [loose]. It's a trait of his -- where he starts the bout slow -- that has cost him in the past: it's also how he lost to eventual gold medallist Rei Higuchi in the semifinals. Aman stuck to his brief: against Cruz, he dictated the bout from the start.\n\nThe Puerto Rican got the first tackle in as he latched into a takedown on Aman's right leg and got on the scorecard. Any lesser wrestler would have panicked a bit, but Aman, known for his calmness, showed no signs of worry. He struck back at Cruz with a takedown for two and brought out his attack-attack-attack style to put Cruz on the back foot.\n\nIt's exactly what Aman specialises in: his incredible levels of endurance allow him to attack non-stop and that paid dividends as he executed two more takedowns to lead 6-3 at the break.\n\nFirmly in control, Aman used his footwork to spin around Cruz and flatten him on the mat for two more mid-way in the second period. Cruz tried to break Aman's momentum by asking for two medical breaks, but it made no difference.\n\nAman had won the biggest medal of his life, yet there was no hint of a smile on his face. He maintained his composure and the only celebration was an index finger that he wagged while looking above. Aman would later say that he dedicated the medal to his late parents, who passed away when he was a child.\n\nAhead of the final, Aman planned his weight cut well, especially after what happened with Vinesh Phogat and Ravi [he had to lose four kgs overnight and had barely any energy for the final] in Tokyo.\n\nAman had around two and a half kilograms to lose overnight and after two sessions he finally broke the weight at 4:30am. He climbed onto that weighing scale around 7:30 am and only after he got the green light did he finally manage to get some sleep.\n\nAman had moved to New Delhi's Chhatrasal stadium, the nursery of Indian wrestling, when he was 10 years old. He was orphaned a year later and Chhatrasal became his home. Aman learnt the basics of wrestling on the same sand pits and foam mats as two-time Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar and Aman's idol - Ravi Dahiya.\n\nTraining around them rubbed off on him - he was inspired by Sushil's work ethic, for example - but the wrestler Aman was able to relate to the most was Ravi. He, too, had come to Chhatrasal as a child and learnt the ropes here before winning silver medal in Tokyo.\n\nIronically, Aman had beaten Ravi to earn the right to compete at the Olympics and he had one single aim: to bring a medal back and extend Chhatrasal's legacy. India's last four male Olympic wrestling medallists have come from here: Sushil, Yogeshwar Dutt, Bajrang Punia and Ravi. Aman is now part of that coveted group.\n\nThis win is Aman's biggest on the senior circuit, a stunning result for someone who turned senior two years ago. Aman had bossed age-group events before that, winning two bronzes at the World Cadet level before a gold at the Asian Cadets in 2019. In 2022, at 19, he made the transition to the big leagues. He won bronze in the Asian U20 Championship and followed it with a gold in the Asian U23 Championships.\n\nHis biggest moment until now was the World U23 Championships title in 2022. It was something Bajrang Punia and Ravi had not managed to do. It set him up to fully graduate to the seniors, where he clinched the gold at the 2023 Asian Championships and a bronze at the Asian Games.\n\nEven then, his photo did not find a place in the underground training hall in Chhatrasal. Coach Kumar had said he contemplated putting Aman's photo there after the Asian Games but felt a picture with an Olympic medal might look better. Like the writing on the walls in Aman's room says \"If it were easy, everyone would do it.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy, but Aman has now earned the right to have his photo put up on that wall now.",

    "raw_text": "Women's basketball has been growing at an exponential pace over the past several years. On Friday, it will expand even more when Unrivaled tips off in Miami.\n\nA new 3-on-3 league, Unrivaled is a domestic opportunity for WNBA players to compete during the offseason. But to those who helped bring the league to fruition, it was about bringing competitive basketball back to its simplest, rawest form, like playing hoops on the playground.\n\n\"Everything was built for the players,\" Luke Cooper, Unrivaled's president of basketball operations, told ESPN. \"The business was built for the players, the facility was built for the players, and the actual game -- the 3-on-3 full court is rooted in how you would play basketball as a kid.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the league ahead of its inaugural season.\n\nWhat is Unrivaled?\n\nSince the WNBA's inaugural season in 1997, many of the league's players have headed overseas to continue playing in the offseason -- both to supplement their income and find high-level competition.\n\nFounded by Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, Unrivaled provides an opportunity for 36 of the top WNBA players to remain in the United States for an eight-week season that runs Jan. 17 to March 17 in a custom-built facility in Miami. It's not the first domestic alternative league. Athletes Unlimited, a 5-on-5 league that launched in 2022, will play its fourth season from Feb. 5 to March 2 in Nashville, with 29 of 40 participants having WNBA experience.\n\nBut Unrivaled, which will consist of six teams, looks to set itself apart with its salaries, amenities and style of play.\n\n\"It was built by basketball people for basketball players,\" Cooper said. \"That's our north star. ... We have an incredible pool of 36 players that will make each other better, so we're unique in that sense in the marketplace.\"\n\nUnrivaled aims to be the first league to compete with the WNBA financially and with its resources.\n\nHow much are the players getting paid?\n\nUnrivaled officials said the league has surpassed $35 million in funding, with Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps, U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff, South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley and USC star JuJu Watkins among the investors.\n\nWhen the league was announced, one of Unrivaled's selling points was that its average salaries would be higher than the WNBA's -- albeit with a fourth as many players.\n\nThe average salary in the WNBA in 2024 was about $119,500, with the high around $242,000.\n\nUnrivaled has said it is offering \"the highest average salary in professional women's (team) sports.\" League president Alex Bazzell told SB Nation in December that Unrivaled has a total salary pool of $8 million, which puts the league's average salary around $222,222.\n\nIn addition to their salary, Unrivaled players get equity in the league. Unrivaled officials declined to discuss the league's player compensation with ESPN.\n\nWhich players are involved?\n\nUnrivaled set out to get as many top WNBA players as possible to commit to the league. When league officials pitched it to them, all they had was a concept: \"This is what we hope it's going to look like,\" and \"this is what we want it to feel like.\"\n\n\"I give a lot of credit to these players,\" Cooper said. \"They took a risk.\"\n\nThe 36 players competing in Unrivaled this season includes seven No. 1 WNBA draft picks (Aliyah Boston, Rhyne Howard, Sabrina Ionescu, Jackie Young, Stewart, Jewell Loyd and Brittney Griner), one WNBA MVP (Stewart) and 17 former Olympians.\n\nCameron Brink, the No. 2 pick in the 2024 WNBA draft, has committed to playing in Unrivaled but will sit out this season as she recovers from a June 2024 ACL injury.\n\nA'ja Wilson, the reigning WNBA MVP, and Rookie of the Year Caitlin Clark opted not to participate in Unrivaled this season.\n\nUConn senior Paige Bueckers, the projected No. 1 pick in April's WNBA draft, and LSU junior Flau'Jae Johnson have signed NIL deals with Unrivaled. Bueckers is expected to join the league in 2026.\n\nHow were the rosters built?\n\nOn Nov. 20, all six Unrivaled head coaches met in Miami to select the teams. Thirty-four of the league's 36 players (the two wild-card spots were still being decided) were separated into six pods based on positions and style of play. From there, the six coaches worked collaboratively to create each team, picking at least one player from each pod with the goal of building balanced rosters.\n\nBut the coaches had no idea which teams they'd be leading until after the selection process was complete.\n\n\"It was putting the onus back on the coaches,\" Cooper said.\n\nJump to Unrivaled's rosters\n\nWhere will Unrivaled be played, and how long is the season?\n\nThe Unrivaled season will last eight weeks, including playoffs, and will be played entirely at the MediaPro Center in Miami. Games will be played each week on Monday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe regular season will consist of a round-robin format, with the six teams facing each opponent at least once and each team playing 14 games. The top four teams based on record will advance to the playoffs. Head-to-head records and point differential will serve as tiebreakers.\n\nThe playoffs start March 16 -- which is also Selection Sunday for men's and women's college basketball -- with two single-elimination semifinal games. The championship game is March 17.\n\nUnrivaled also recently announced it will hold a 1-on-1 tournament from Feb. 10 to 14 that pits players against one another in a single-elimination, winner-take-all competition with a $250,000 reward for the winner and an additional $10,000 for their 3-on-3 teammates.\n\nHow are Unrivaled's 3-on-3 rules different from the Olympic 3x3 event?\n\nUnrivaled will be played on a 49.2-by-72-foot condensed full court rather than the half court (36 feet by 49 feet) used at the Olympics. For reference, the WNBA is played on a 94-by-50-foot court.\n\n\"It feels like you are watching a basketball game and there just happens to be four less players on the court,\" Cooper said. \"It's not a gimmick. It's basketball with more space to operate with and a little shorter of a court, so the players have the stamina to play.\"\n\nEach Unrivaled game will feature three seven-minute quarters and a fourth quarter that the league is calling \"winning score.\" The winning score will be determined by adding 11 points to the leading team's score through three quarters. For example, if the score is 50-48 heading into the final quarter, the first team to reach 61 points wins. There will never be overtime.\n\n\"This game is rooted in how you would play basketball as a kid on a black top,\" Cooper said. \"There's flow. There's pace.\"\n\nUnrivaled organizers hope playing to a target score eliminates late fouls and speeds up the game overall. To that end, the free throw process also will be different. When a player is fouled -- whether on a layup or a 3-pointer -- only one free throw will be awarded. The single shot is worth two points for a foul on a 2-point field goal or three points if the foul occurred on a 3-point attempt. A free throw attempt after a foul on a made basket is worth one point.\n\nPlayers will foul out after their sixth foul, but if the team has only three players available and one of them picks up a sixth foul, the player will remain in the game but incur technical fouls for each additional foul they commit.\n\nThe games will use an 18-second shot clock, compared to the WNBA's 24 seconds, and the clock will be stopped on made baskets only in the last 30 seconds of periods rather than in the last minute.\n\nExcept for tip-off at the start of the game, all jump ball situations are replaced by alternating possessions.\n\nWho are the coaches?\n\nThe six head coaches have different levels of experience in the NBA and WNBA, headlined by former Chicago Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon and former NBA assistant coach Phil Handy, who most recently spent five seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nWeatherspoon will lead the Vinyl, while Handy will coach the Mist.\n\nFormer Washington Mystics assistant Andrew Wade will lead the Laces, and Nola Henry, who recently spent time with the Los Angeles Sparks, will coach the Rose. Adam Harrington, a former assistant and director for player development for the Brooklyn Nets, will coach the Phantom. And WNBA and NBA skills coach DJ Sackmann will coach the Lunar Owls.\n\nHow to watch Unrivaled\n\nMonday and Friday night games will be on TNT, the league's broadcast rights holder. Saturday games will be shown on TruTV. All games will also be available for streaming on Max.\n\nUnrivaled rosters\n\nLaces BC\n\nStefanie Dolson, F/C, Washington Mystics\n\nTiffany Hayes, G, Las Vegas Aces\n\nKate Martin, G, Golden State Valkyries\n\nKayla McBride, G, Minnesota Lynx\n\nAlyssa Thomas, F, Connecticut Sun\n\nJackie Young, G, Las Vegas Aces\n\nLunar Owls BC\n\nShakira Austin, F/C, Washington Mystics\n\nCameron Brink, F, Los Angeles Sparks\n\nNapheesa Collier, G, Minnesota Lynx\n\nSkylar Diggins-Smith, G, Seattle Storm\n\nAllisha Gray, G, Atlanta Dream\n\nCourtney Williams, G, Minnesota Lynx\n\nMist BC\n\nDiJonai Carrington, G, Connecticut Sun\n\nAaliyah Edwards, F, Washington Mystics\n\nRickea Jackson, F, Los Angeles Sparks\n\nJewell Loyd, G, Seattle Storm\n\nBreanna Stewart, F, New York Liberty\n\nCourtney Vandersloot, G, New York Liberty\n\nPhantom BC\n\nNatasha Cloud, G, Phoenix Mercury\n\nBrittney Griner, C, Phoenix Mercury\n\nSabrina Ionescu, G, New York Liberty\n\nMarina Mabrey, G, Connecticut Sun\n\nSatou Sabally, F, Dallas Wings\n\nKatie Lou Samuelson, F, Indiana Fever\n\nRose BC\n\nKahleah Copper, G, Phoenix Mercury\n\nChelsea Gray, G, Las Vegas Aces\n\nLexie Hull, G, Indiana Fever\n\nAngel Reese, G, Chicago Sky\n\nAzura Stevens, F/C, Los Angeles Sparks\n\nBrittney Sykes, G, Washington Mystics\n\nVinyl BC",

    "raw_text": "THE PROBLEM WITH living your life under the spotlight is that the camera captures only the public eruption, not the months of silent anger. On Dec. 3, when the New England Patriots played the Buffalo Bills, Tom Brady walked to the sideline after throwing late and behind receiver Brandin Cooks on third down, ending a first-quarter drive. Brady was angrier and more irritable than usual, as has often been the case this season in the eyes of some Patriots players and staff. As he unsnapped his chinstrap, Brady passed offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels on the sideline.\n\n\"He was wide open,\" McDaniels said to Brady, referring to Cooks.\n\nBrady kept walking, and glaring at McDaniels, so the coach repeated: \"We had him open.\"\n\nBrady snapped, pivoting to McDaniels and yelling at him, \"I got it!\" Everyone within earshot, including head coach Bill Belichick, turned to watch as Brady screamed. He removed his helmet, and as a Patriots staffer held him back -- and with McDaniels' father and legendary high school coach in Ohio, Thom, in the stands behind the bench -- capped off the exchange by yelling, \"F--- you!\"\n\nVideo of the scene went viral, with many rationalizing it as a symptom of Brady's legendary competitiveness. Brady would later apologize to McDaniels, who dismissed the incident to reporters as \"part of what makes him great.\" After all, many in the Patriots' building knew that Brady's explosion wasn't really about McDaniels. It wasn't about Cooks. And it wasn't about the Bills game. It was about the culmination of months of significant behind-the-scenes frustrations. For almost two decades, Belichick has managed to subvert the egos of his best player, his boss and himself for the good of the team, yielding historic results. This year, though, the dynamics have been different.\n\nTHE PATRIOTS ARE in uncharted territory. They haven't just won games and titles. They've won at an unprecedented rate and over an unprecedented span, which makes the feelings of entitlement creeping inside Gillette Stadium unprecedented as well. The Patriots, in the only statement anyone associated with the team would make on the record for this story, responded to specific questions by saying that there are \"several inaccuracies and multiple examples given that absolutely did not occur,\" though they declined to go into detail. But according to interviews with more than a dozen New England staffers, executives, players and league sources with knowledge of the team's inner workings, the three most powerful people in the franchise -- Belichick, Brady and owner Robert Kraft -- have had serious disagreements. They differ on Brady's trainer, body coach and business partner Alex Guerrero; over the team's long-term plans at quarterback; over Belichick's bracing coaching style; and most of all, over who will be the last man standing. Those interviewed describe a palpable sense in the building that this might be the last year together for this group.\n\nBrady, Belichick and Kraft have raised expectations and possibilities so high that virtually no other team in the Super Bowl era could truly comprehend what it's like to be them. Brady and Belichick weren't only pushing the boundaries of what a team could accomplish. They also were challenging basic understandings of how a group of high achievers escape the usual pulls of ego and pride. For 17 years, the Patriots have withstood everything the NFL and opponents could throw their way, knowing that if they were united, nobody could touch them. Now they're threatening to come undone the only way possible: from within.\n\nTHE CRACKS FIRST revealed themselves in early September. The season had just started, and Guerrero was once again becoming an issue in the Patriots' building, just weeks before the release of Brady's first real book, \"The TB12 Method.\" It was more than a fitness and diet guide. For Brady, a self-described \"loner\" who always seemed most comfortable surrounded by family or on a football field, the book represented a move to extend his brand beyond the game -- and beyond the Patriots. Until a few years ago, he seemed uninterested in ever doing so, content to be a father and husband and son and brother and transcendent quarterback, knowing there wasn't time for much else.\n\nGuerrero persuaded Brady to find time. The two men had worked together for years, with Guerrero having found a spot in Brady's famously small group of advisers, eventually becoming a godfather to one of his sons. Guerrero has a history of controversial methods -- in 2005, he paid a judgment to the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations that he had claimed dietary supplements could help cure cancer -- and he believed he had discovered a way to revolutionize how athletes train. In his book and in the building, Brady was offering opinions not only on training but also on lifestyle, writing that he envisioned a world populated with TB12 Sports Therapy Center franchises.\n\nFew in the building had a problem with Brady's method -- mostly based on stretching with bands, eating lots of vegetables, drinking lots of water, getting lots of sleep and, most of all, achieving peak \"pliability.\" They did have a problem with what Brady and Guerrero promised the TB12 Method could do. They claimed it could absolve football of responsibility for injury: \"When athletes get injured, they shouldn't blame their sport,\" Brady wrote. The method also was so consuming and unwavering in its rules and convictions that, while it helped some players, it felt \"like a cult\" to others, one Patriots staffer says. The way TB12 began to creep into Brady's life worried people close to the QB, many of whom were suspicious of Guerrero. \"Tom changed,\" says a friend of Brady's. \"That's where a lot of these problems started.\"\n\nBrady and Guerrero's training beliefs introduced an unspoken pressure in the building, with players wondering where they should work out. In August, receiver Julian Edelman blew out his knee, costing him the season, and there was \"hypersensitivity\" among players, in the words of a Patriots coach, over who would take his place. New players felt the surest way to earn Brady's trust was to join Rob Gronkowski, Danny Amendola and others by seeking advice from Guerrero at his TB12 clinic -- and not team doctors, which Belichick preferred. Guerrero says he wasn't pressuring players to adopt his approach. \"Players have always decided to come or not come on their own,\" he says now. But according to multiple sources, players openly discussed with Patriots coaches, staff and trusted advisers whether to follow Brady or the team, leaving them trapped: Do we risk alienating the NFL's most powerful coach or risk alienating the NFL's most powerful quarterback?\n\nEARLY THIS SEASON, Belichick wanted to discuss all these issues with Brady.\n\nGuerrero had been around the team for years, mostly as an unthreatening outsider who worked with former linebacker Willie McGinest and, starting in 2004, Brady. On the author page in his 2004 book, \"In Balance for Life,\" Guerrero says he received a degree in traditional Chinese medicine from the now-closed Samra University of Oriental Medicine in Los Angeles, and later opened a sports injury, rehabilitation and performance-enhancement center, also in Los Angeles. In 2013, Belichick had welcomed Guerrero into the New England fold, giving him free rein in the building and, sources with direct knowledge of the situation say, access to meetings in which medical records for Patriots players were discussed (Guerrero denies ever having seen any records). The coach figured that, because Guerrero had Brady's best interests in mind, he probably had the Patriots' best interests in mind too, and could be trusted. But Guerrero often would blame Patriots trainers for injuries, while offering few insightful opinions of his own, and Belichick quickly realized inviting him had been a mistake. And so in 2014, he eliminated Guerrero's access to those meetings while keeping him on as a team consultant. That was the same year Brady and Guerrero decided to market their business as revolutionary; the same year that Brady began to speak unwaveringly about playing into his mid-40s; and the same year that Belichick drafted Jimmy Garoppolo out of Eastern Illinois -- the first sign that Belichick was invested in a future that did not include the quarterback who had changed his life and legacy.\n\nIt was also the same year that the Patriots would go on a run toward their fourth Super Bowl win, altering the team dynamic in fundamental ways that would come to a head this fall. During their 10-year championship drought, Brady and Belichick had come up just short together and could only dive back into the redemptive power of work, trying to slim the margins between defeat and victory. In beating the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX, the two men drew strength from different touchstones. Belichick found virtue in his idea of the Patriot Way -- the demanding, football-first culture with an emotionless pursuit of victory -- and Brady found virtue in his Method, which he believed helped him thwart the inevitability of time, reinforcing his belief that he was still not on the downside of his career and deserving of a new contract. In 2016, Kraft and Brady's agent, Don Yee, began negotiating a new deal; Belichick and other Patriots staff had to abruptly leave the NFL combine in Indianapolis to be part of the process. Brady's two-year contract, with a $28 million signing bonus, was designed to set up 2018 as a key year, when the team could, in theory, look at a 41-year-old Brady and his $22 million cap hit and decide if it made sense to transition to Garoppolo.\n\nA year later, after another Super Bowl win -- the Brady-led, historic comeback from 28-3 to defeat the Atlanta Falcons -- Brady's stature in the organization had grown to the point that he was considered management. New players often address him as \"sir.\" As Brady gained power, so did Guerrero, who became an even more divisive force in the building. One player visited TB12 under what he perceived as pressure, and declined to allow Guerrero to massage his injured legs. Instead he asked to keep treatment limited to only his arm, out of fear that one of Guerrero's famous deep-force muscle treatments would set back his recovery. The Boston Sports Journal would report on another player who was told by Patriots trainers to do squats but later instructed by Guerrero to not do them. Brady would tell teammates, \"Bill's answer to everything is to lift more weights\" -- a claim that many staffers and players felt was unfair, given the team's dedication to soft-tissue science and a healthy diet.\n\nAnd so after several such incidents, Belichick explained to Brady in early September that many younger players felt pressured to train at TB12 rather than with the team, and asked the quarterback what was going on. Brady said he didn't know anything about any such pressure, according to people briefed on the exchange, and the two men left the meeting without any resolution.\n\nBelichick felt the need to permanently clarify Guerrero's role, drawing sharp boundaries. After the brief discussion with Brady, Belichick emailed Guerrero to let him know that while he was welcome to work with any players who sought out TB12, he was no longer permitted access to the sideline or all of the team headquarters because he wasn't an employee of the Patriots (a point that Belichick would resoundingly make clear when reporters asked about Guerrero).\n\nAn email designed to solve problems only created more of them. Guerrero texted some of the Patriots players who were clients and specified, he says now, \"that I would need to treat them at the TB12 Sports Therapy Center.\" But several players told staffers and coaches that Guerrero gave them the impression that Belichick would no longer allow them to work with him. In the view of many Patriots, it was an example of Guerrero trying to split the organization by turning players against Belichick. All of this happened as Brady, serving as TB12's test case, continued to reiterate publicly and privately his goal of playing into his mid-40s. In October, he again explained to Kraft and Belichick his plans to play a few more years. The question was whether Brady had earned long-term security from the Patriots, or if he would finish his career somewhere else.\n\nBELICHICK HAS FAMOUSLY staked his entire career on the idea that long-term security doesn't exist in the NFL. Fear, paranoia, the irrelevance of yesterday and tomorrow, and acceptance of Belichick as the ultimate authority are as much a part of the Patriot Way as selflessness and sacrifice. For years, Brady stood as the perfect model for Belichick's system, a future Hall of Famer who could withstand tough and biting coaching. Brady always knew the hits were coming during Monday morning film sessions -- \"The quarterback at Foxborough High could make that throw,\" Belichick often would say after replaying a Brady misfire -- but he could take it, secure not only in the knowledge of his singular impact on Belichick's career but also in the theater of it all, that the coach was doing it in part to send a message that nobody was above criticism. \"Tommy is fine with it,\" his father, Tom Brady Sr., said years ago over dinner in San Mateo, California. \"He's the perfect foil for it.\"\n\nBrady is less fine with it this year. People close to him believe that it started after last year's playoff win over the Houston Texans, in which Brady completed only 18 of 38 passes and threw two interceptions. Belichick lit into him in front of the entire team in a way nobody had ever seen, ripping Brady for carelessness with the ball. \"This will get us beat,\" he told the team after replaying a Brady interception. \"We were lucky to get away with a win.\"\n\nThe criticism has continued this year, as Brady has been hit a lot and battled various injuries. Atypically, he has missed a lot of practices and, in the team's private evaluations, is showing the slippage of a 40-year-old quarterback even as he is contending for MVP and is as deadly as ever with the game on the line. Injuries to his shoulder and Achilles have done more than undermine claims that the TB12 Method can help you play football virtually pain-free. Subtle changes have at times hampered the offense and affected the depth chart. On a fourth-quarter play against the Los Angeles Chargers, for instance, Brady had a clean pocket and a first read open deep, possibly for a touchdown. But Brady got rid of the ball quickly over the middle to receiver Chris Hogan, who had nowhere to run and was hit hard, injuring his shoulder. He missed all but one game of the rest of the season. \"Tom was trying to get it out quick,\" a Patriots staffer says. \"As fragility has increased, nervousness has also increased.\"\n\nAt the same time, as his age has increased, Brady has become an advocate of positive thinking. Belichick's negativity and cynicism have gotten old, Brady has told other Patriots players and staff. He feels he has accomplished enough that he shouldn't have to endure so much grief. Patriots staffers have noticed that, this year more than ever, he seems to volley between unwavering confidence and driving insecurity. Brady has noted to staff a few times this year that, no matter how many game-changing throws he makes, Belichick hasn't awarded him Patriot of the Week all year.\n\nThose who know Belichick and Brady well are amazed that they've co-existed this long, two ruthless and proud self-made men, both secure though still unfinished in their legacies, both loved and hated, both having received stiff penalties for cheating, both motivated by ego, humility and -- as much as anything -- doubt. Belichick is famously secretive, creating an entire system in which knowledge flows directly to him and only he decides how to deploy and exploit it. And Brady is famously unhelpful toward his backups -- or, at least, a threat like Garoppolo. The two quarterbacks were friendly, but Brady -- like Joe Montana to Steve Young and Brett Favre to Aaron Rodgers -- didn't see it as his role to advise Garoppolo, even on matters as trivial as footwork, as nobody had helped him during his climb. Garoppolo played well in 2016, starting in place of the suspended Brady, and Belichick began to see Garoppolo as the final piece of his legacy, to walk away in a few years with the Patriots secure at quarterback. But after Garoppolo was knocked out of his second start because of a shoulder injury, he set up a visit at TB12. As he later told Patriots staffers, when he arrived, the door was locked. He knocked; nobody was there. He called TB12 trainers but nobody answered. He couldn't believe it, Garoppolo told the staffers, and that night ended up visiting team trainers instead. Guerrero vehemently denies ever refusing to see any player, and Garoppolo was eventually treated at TB12 -- but it was two weeks after he showed up for his original appointment, and only after a high-ranking Patriots staffer called TB12 to inquire why Garoppolo hadn't been admitted.\n\nSeveral times this past October, Brady met with Kraft to discuss playing longer. That same month, he also met with Belichick, who was skeptical of a long-term contract extension but was content to start Brady as long as he was the best quarterback. Belichick understood how much Brady had meant to the franchise, and had always insisted privately that he wouldn't move on from Brady unless he could convince the coaching staff of it. But the reality was that no quarterback has ever played at a championship level into his 40s. The meeting ended in a \"little blowup,\" according to a source. Complicating matters was that Garoppolo would be a free agent at the end of this season. Complicating matters more was that Brady and Garoppolo share Yee as an agent.\n\nAnd complicating matters even more was that Belichick didn't want to trade Garoppolo. He had passed on dealing him last spring, when Garoppolo was in high demand. In early September, Belichick did trade third-string quarterback Jacoby Brissett to the Colts for wide receiver Phillip Dorsett. \"If we trade Jimmy, we're the Cleveland Browns, with no succession plan,\" one person inside the organization said earlier in the year. The Patriots repeatedly offered Garoppolo four-year contract extensions, in the $17 million to $18 million range annually that would go higher if and when he succeeded Brady. Garoppolo and Yee rejected the offers out of hand, for reasons that remain unclear, and the Patriots knew they couldn't make any promises to Garoppolo about the timing of a transition at quarterback without it getting back to Brady.\n\nTwo weeks before the Nov. 1 trading deadline, Belichick met with Kraft to discuss the quarterback situation. According to staffers, the meeting ran long, lasting half the day and pushing back Belichick's other meetings. The office was buzzing. The meeting ended with a clear mandate to Belichick: trade Garoppolo because he would not be in the team's long-term plans, and then, once again, find the best quarterback in the draft and develop him. Belichick was furious and demoralized, according to friends. But in the end, he did what he asks of his players and coaches: He did his job. One morning in late October, Belichick texted San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan and asked him to call. Belichick had long admired Kyle's father, Mike, who not only had been one of the NFL's smartest tacticians but had also personally defended Belichick to commissioner Roger Goodell during the Spygate scandal. At the combine this past February, Kyle, weeks into the 49ers job after being the offensive coordinator for the Falcons, met with Belichick for hours to learn from his team's humiliating Super Bowl loss. Belichick believed that Garoppolo would excel under Shanahan, and when he and Shanahan connected on the phone, Belichick offered the quarterback for a second-rounder.\n\nIt was a steal, leaving Patriots staffers stunned and confused. Why would the game's shrewdest long-term strategist trade two backup quarterbacks in a two-month span when his starter was 40 years old and banged up? And why did Belichick practically give away a quarterback whom the coaches saw as a potential top-10 player for much less than he could have gotten last spring? It made no sense. Belichick handled the trade as he always does, by not explaining it to the coaches and by burying them so deep in work that they didn't have time to gossip. Most in the organization understood that it was an extreme case, with extreme personalities, but they felt that Belichick had earned the right to make football decisions. Belichick, having always subscribed to the philosophy that it's time to go once an owner gets involved in football decisions, left the impression with some friends that the current dynamic was unsustainable.\n\nBrady, though, seemed liberated. Kraft hugged Brady when he saw him that week, in full view of teammates. A few days later during practice, some players and staffers noticed that Brady seemed especially excited, hollering and cajoling. Brady was once again the team's present and future. His new backup, Brian Hoyer, was a longtime friend and not a threat. The owner was in Brady's corner. \"He won,\" a Patriots staffer says.\n\nNOBODY IS BUDGING now. Kraft, Brady and Belichick were supposed to meet in late December to clear the air, but that never happened. It probably won't until after the season. Those interviewed describe a lingering sadness around the team, as if coaches and staff know that the end might be near. Both McDaniels and defensive coordinator Matt Patricia are expected to become head coaches; other assistant coaches might leave to join their staffs or for college jobs, or even retire. The imminent exodus raises the question going forward: Is it possible that Belichick would rather walk away than try to rebuild the staff with a 41-year-old Brady and another year of Guerrero drama -- all while trying to develop a new quarterback? Belichick being Belichick, those around him know nothing of his plans. He has always been a football genius, artfully letting situations play out. The looming uncertainty has taken a toll on everyone, even as the Patriots finished 13-3 and earned the top seed in the AFC playoffs. \"Bill's done a phenomenal job of holding the building together,\" one Patriots official says.\n\nNow 76 years old, Kraft ultimately will attempt to broker a solution. He has paid both Brady and Belichick tens of millions of dollars, won and lost some of the greatest games in NFL history with them, and has stood by both at their lowest moments. He apologized in front of a room of owners for Spygate. And he stood by Brady during Deflategate, even after he backed down and accepted the NFL's penalty. Kraft did so even though many staffers in the building believed there was merit in the allegation, however absurd the case. The team quietly parted ways with both John Jastremski and Jim McNally, the equipment staffers accused of deflating footballs -- they've never spoken publicly -- and Belichick reorganized the equipment staff. Kraft has privately told associates he knew that he went too far in his attacks against the league. \"I had to do it for the fans,\" he has told confidants.\n\nA fifth Super Bowl triumph healed some of those wounds, but there's no guarantee that a sixth will fix the rest. Something has to change, that much everyone knows. Many Patriots players and staff believe that Brady is a good man who has a hard time saying no to Guerrero. They've noticed that he seems to be searching this year, as if reaching the pinnacle of his profession is as fleeting as it is rewarding, manifesting itself in outbursts like the one at McDaniels. Belichick seems to be grinding harder than ever, as if more than a sixth championship is at stake. Before the Patriots played the Steelers in December, he told players, \"I brought you here for games like this.\"\n\nBut Belichick also has taken a longer view, as though he sees pieces of his impact leaguewide. He's preparing assistant coaches for job interviews elsewhere, which he didn't always do in years past. He has taken pride in Garoppolo's 5-0 record in San Francisco -- and in the fact that Kraft has confessed to people in the building that trading Garoppolo might have been a mistake. He reset a toxic relationship with the Colts with the Brissett trade. He has even become good friends with Goodell. The two men had a long and private meeting, which two sources told ESPN occurred during the off week after the regular season, when the commissioner visited Foxborough. The NFL says the meeting happened last year, not within the past week.\n\nBelichick always had a vision for how, after more than four decades in the NFL, he wanted to walk away, beyond setting up the team at quarterback. He wanted his sons, Brian and Steve, both Patriots assistants, to be established in their football careers. And he wanted the winning to continue without him, to have a legacy of always having the best interests of the franchise in mind. Both Brady and Belichick have redefined how much influence a coach and quarterback can have on a team game. But this year has shown that the legacy of football's greatest coach, like the game itself, is beyond his control.\n\nA FEW HOURS before the Patriots played the New York Jets in the regular-season finale, Belichick walked straight out of the locker room and out to the field. It was 13 degrees before kickoff with subzero wind chill, the coldest regular-season game in team history, but he was wearing a short-sleeve T-shirt, shorts and receiver gloves. Pictures of him went viral, and for a moment it was reminiscent of a legendary playoff game 16 years earlier, when the Patriots played the Raiders in the snow. That night, Brady once recalled in an NFL Films interview, he took the field for warm-ups wearing a sleeveless T-shirt in the thick snow. He was 24 years old, at the beginning of a career only he saw coming. He wanted to send a message to everyone watching that nobody was tougher, both mentally and physically, than this California kid. That night, Brady showed that he was immune to the stage, a deficit, the weather and a stout defense. It was clear that the Patriots had something special, both at quarterback and under the headset, and it created a moment, both emboldening and addictive, that has lasted far longer than anyone could have expected.\n\nOn Sunday, the moment -- their moment -- seemed as alive as ever, to the outside. Belichick ordered the field crew to hang thermometers in the hallway outside of the Jets' locker room, just to mess with a franchise he still hates so much that he barely mentions his years there in the Patriots' media guide. The game unfolded like many have for the Patriots this year, with Brady looking mortal at times and like an MVP at others. As usual, the Patriots won. It didn't look like Belichick's last regular-season game as the Patriots' head coach, but several coaches and staffers later remarked to one another that it felt as if it could be. As Brady and Belichick left the field, bundled up in the cold, the only thing clear was that the beginning of the end started a long time ago, masked by success and the joy and pain of the rise, leaving both men this year's playoffs and their collective will to stave off the fall.",

Defending champions Puneri Paltan are out of the playoff picture, and come December 29, the PKL will crown a new champion from the six teams battling it out in Pune.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the PKL 11 playoffs:\n\nWho are the contenders to win PKL 11?\n\nHaryana Steelers: Table-toppers and last season's runners up - chasing a first title in franchise history.\n\nDabang Delhi: PKL 8 champions, with constant playoff appearances.\n\nUP Yoddhas: Making their fourth playoff appearance in seven seasons of existence, also chasing a first title.\n\nPatna Pirates: The most successful team in PKL history (3-time winners) but looking to win a first title in six years.\n\nU Mumba: PKL 2 champions, enjoying a resurgence after dismal last three seasons.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers: Seeking to join Patna Pirates as the most successful PKL franchise, last champions in PKL 9.\n\nHow do the PKL playoffs work?\n\nIt's familiar enough for Indian sports afficionados now - with all top franchise leagues like the IPL and ISL also following the six-team playoff format.\n\nHaryana Steelers and Dabang Delhi, by virtue of finishing first and second in the table respectively, make a direct entry into the semifinals. Their opponents will be decided two eliminators, taking place between the teams that finished third to sixth.\n\nThird-placed UP Yoddhas faces Jaipur Pink Panthers (6th) in the first eliminator, with the winner of this contest facing Haryana Steelers in the semifinal. Patna Pirates (4th) face U Mumba (5th) in the other eliminator, with the winner taking on Dabang Delhi in the semifinal.\n\nPKL 11 playoffs schedule:\n\nDecember 26: Eliminator 1: UP Yoddhas vs Jaipur Pink Panthers at 8 pm, Eliminator 2: Patna Pirates vs U Mumba at 9 pm.\n\nDecember 27: Haryana Steelers vs winner of Eliminator 1 at 8 pm, Dabang Delhi vs winner of Eliminator 2 at 9 pm.\n\nDecember 29: Final at 8 pm.\n\nWhat do the playoff matchups look like?\n\nUP Yoddhas vs Jaipur Pink Panthers - winner faces Haryana Steelers\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers have only managed the single victory against the other teams who made it to the playoffs this season, and as luck would have had it - it came against the UP Yoddhas. Both teams boast of excellent lead raiders with more than decent defensive prowess. It's no surprise then, that the games between the two teams were tight affairs, JPP winning 33-30 on November 5, before the Yoddhas had their revenge on November 28, winning 33-29.\n\nThe Panthers are still heavily reliant on Arjun Deshwal who's the third-best raider in the league with 228 points. Ankush Rathee and Reza Mirbagheri lead their defence, but they'll have a tough time stopping the Yoddhas who can attack on multiple fronts via Bhavani Rajput, Gagan Gowda and Bharat Hooda. Coaches Jasveer Singh and Upendra Malik have fashioned a competent defence around Sumit Sangwan and Hitesh, which makes this contest incredibly hard to call. The Yoddhas have a slight advantage when it comes to scoring, and if they shut down Deshwal (which is easier said than done), Jaipur don't have an impressive plan B. However, coach Sanjeev Baliyan has been there and done it twice (winning PKL 3 with Patna Pirates and PKL 9 with the Panthers) and he might have an ace up his sleeve.\n\nThe issue for either team, of course, is that their reward for victory is a match against table-toppers Haryana Steelers. Manpreet Singh has continued with his defence-first approach, and it's incredibly hard to beat his side. There's some hope after the Steelers lost to the Yoddhas recently, but that was after the table-toppers had already sealed their semifinal spot and taken their eye off the ball. The spreading out of raiding responsibilities (Vinay, Shivan Patare) as well as defensive onus (Mohammadreza Shadloui, Rahul Sethpal) has meant that's its nigh-on impossible to craft specific strategies against the Steelers. After a runners-up finish last season, it's very likely that Manpreet Singh will complete his coaching journey with the title this year - all thanks to the strength of his all-round collective.\n\nPatna Pirates vs U Mumba - winner faces Dabang Delhi\n\nIt's the poster-game for PKL's focus on youth this season, as Patna Pirates take on U Mumba is a battle of franchises that have platformed new-ish faces this season. In 22 games this season, the Pirates have scored 125 points more than U Mumba, topping the league with 884 points. Yet, when it comes to a straight fight between the two, it's U Mumba's Iranian coach Gholamreza Mazandarani who outsmarts Narender Redhu as he's won both games against the Pirates this season - which played a large part in their qualification for the playoffs.\n\nThe Pirates are a scoring machine, with Devank the league's top-scoring raider (280 pts), coupled with Ayan Lohchab's 172 points. Ankit Jaglan, Shubham Shinde and Deepak Singh handle defensive duties for the side, but when things get tough, it's often the Pirates' defence that can't keep up. They conceded points at crucial junctures in both losses against U Mumba, and that can prove their downfall. 19% of Ajit Chouhan's impressive 180 points this season have come against the Pirates, and he clearly has their number. This contest could hinge around this battle, as U Mumba have limited the Devank-Ayan combination better than the rest of the league.\n\nThe triumph of youth will face up to one of the most threatening sides in PKL history - Dabang Delhi have broken the single-season record for consecutive unbeaten games (14) - and one wonders what records could have been achieved had Naveen Kumar been fit for the first seven games of the season. In his absence at the start of the season, Ashu Malik came to the fore and has even gone on to eclipse the Naveen Express, with his 256 points the second-best in the league. Coach Joginder Narwal also has one of the best defenders in the league in Yogesh Dahiya and will be relying on him to marshal a somewhat underperforming defence. That defence struggled in losses to the Pirates and U Mumba earlier in the season, and a quest for a first title since season 8 could come undone if Dabang Delhi aren't on their A-game.",

    "raw_text": "This is no ordinary January transfer window for Manchester City, but then this is no ordinary season for manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nHis team -- winners of the past four Premier League titles -- are 12 points adrift of leaders Liverpool in this season's race, with fixtures against Arsenal, Newcastle, Liverpool and Tottenham all to come in February.\n\nParticipants in two of the past four UEFA Champions League finals, City's hopes of continuing in this season's competition rest on the result of their make-or-break game against Club Brugge at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. Win, and they carry on. Lose, and it's an early exit from European competition for the first time since 2012-13.\n\nIn response to what has been a difficult start to the campaign, City are trying to regenerate.\n\nWhile battling to save their season, striker Erling Haaland has been signed to an unprecedented 9\u00bd-year contract, and \u00a3130 million has been committed to sign three new players -- Omar Marmoush (\u00a360m, Eintract Frankfurt), Abdukodir Khusanov (\u00a340m, Lens) and Vitor Reis (\u00a330m, Palmeiras) -- in the January window so far. And there is the prospect of more to come before the deadline on Feb. 3.\n\nIt's a different approach for City, who haven't made a significant January signing since bringing in Aymeric Laporte for \u00a357m from Athletic Club in 2018.\n\nCity's shift in thinking about transfers\n\nMan City have been forced into action in part because of the injuries that have decimated the start to their season. But there's also an acceptance that changes to the squad should have been made last summer. Instead, after winning a record fourth consecutive top-flight title, Guardiola decided to stick with the players he knew and trusted.\n\nSavinho, the 20-year-old winger, was brought in for \u00a330m from City Football Group members Troyes, after impressing on loan at Girona, another of City's sister clubs in LaLiga. That would have been the sum total of the incomings had Ilkay G\u00fcndogan not unexpectedly become available on a free transfer from Barcelona, just a year after leaving City to move to Camp Nou. Five months on, and Guardiola has already admitted it was a mistake not to do more to refresh the squad when he had the chance. Amid struggles in the Premier League and the Champions League, he has paid the price.\n\n\"In the summer, the club thought about it and I said, 'No, I don't want to make any signings,'\" he said in a news conference before the 2-2 draw at Brentford. \"I relied a lot on these guys and thought I could do it again. But after the injuries -- wow -- maybe we should have done it.\"\n\nThe season-ending knee injury to Ballon d'Or winner Rodri in September has been the most damaging, but other key players have faced issues, including R\u00faben Dias, John Stones, Mateo Kovacic, Nathan Ak\u00e9, Manuel Akanji, and Kevin De Bruyne. The problems in defence have been so severe that 19-year-old Jahmai Simpson-Pusey has had to start games in the Premier League and Champions League, while midfielder Matheus Nunes has been used as an emergency right-back.\n\n\"Last season we didn't do much, due to the exceptional quality of the team,\" Guardiola said last week. \"We anticipated three or four [signings] and we should do it in summer. We had to do it here [in January] for the amount of injuries, the problems that we had.\"\n\nInjuries to defenders have had a major impact on City's January transfer business. Sources have told ESPN that 20-year-old Khusanov and 19-year-old Reis were pencilled in as targets for next summer. But they've been fast-tracked to the Etihad six months ahead of schedule to guard against more problems at the back in the second half of the season.\n\nThere are questions over the durability of Stones and Ake after numerous injury problems, while captain Kyle Walker joined Milan on loan after expressing his desire to move on. In the case of Reis, who has made only 22 senior appearances for Palmeiras, City agreed to pay more (around \u00a330m) to bring him to the club now. Palmeiras' original plan was to keep him until the summer and have him available for the FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nBoth Khusanov and Reis are predominantly centre-backs, but might find they're used at right-back -- at least for the rest of the season. Josko Gvardiol, another young defender signed by City, arrived from RB Leipzig for \u00a377m in 2023 as a centre-back, but has been used more frequently as a left-back.\n\nContinuing injury problems meant Khusanov had to be thrown straight in from the start against Chelsea on Saturday. In a disastrous first five minutes, he gave a goal away, misplaced a number of passes and was booked for chopping down Cole Palmer. It was a tough introduction, in part because the Uzbekistan international had only a handful of training sessions with his teammates before his debut. It was made more difficult by the fact that he doesn't yet speak English and January signings don't get the same bedding period that benefits summer arrivals.\n\nWhy City moved for Marmoush despite risks\n\nThere is hope that Marmoush -- older and more experienced -- is better placed to make an immediate impact.\n\nSent on loan to the second tier of German football as recently as 2021, the Egypt international shot to prominence after scoring 37 goals and providing 20 assists from 67 games over a successful 18 months at Frankfurt following his free transfer from Wolfsburg in 2023. Signing Marmoush for around \u00a360m is considered a risk by some at City, despite his fantastic start to the season with Frankfurt, but one they are willing to take.\n\nCity began the window with little hope that Frankfurt would entertain offers for him while they were so well-placed in the Bundesliga (they're third after 19 games) and in the Europa League (they're second with one round of games left to go in the group stage). Frankfurt knocked back an opening offer of around \u00a350m to sign the 25-year-old, but after negotiations in mid-January, a fee of more than \u00a360m plus add-ons was agreed.\n\nAccording to sources, Man City's stance is that they had hoped winger Oscar Bobb could fill the void left by Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez (who left in an \u00a381m deal to join Atletico Madrid) in the summer only for the Norway international to suffer a broken leg on the eve of the Premier League season. It was unfortunate timing given how well Bobb had performed during preseason.\n\nCity have struggled defensively this season but have also struggled for goals. Before Phil Foden's recent burst of form, their second top scorer this season behind Haaland was Gvardiol, a defender. The hope is that Marmoush can chip in with goals in a similar manner to \u00c1lvarez, who averaged one every three games before he joined Atletico.\n\nThe \u00c1lvarez deal largely helped City fund their January signings, as it handed City a profit of around \u00a365m on the modest fee \u00a315m they paid River Plate in 2022.\n\nOn top of that, the club agreed fees to move on academy graduates -- counted as pure profit on the books in terms of Profit and Sustainability (PSR) rules -- which could total \u00a3276m in the past five years alone; including Taylor Harwood-Bellis (\u00a320m, Southampton), Liam Delap (\u00a315m, Ipswich Town), and Cole Palmer (\u00a342.5m, Chelsea). It means that while other clubs are battling to stay on the right side of PSR, City are able to spend freely while digging themselves out of a hole.\n\nThere's a chance there will be more to come before the deadline, too, with the club actively looking at central midfielders. They would be interested in former City player Douglas Luiz if he's allowed to leave Juventus this month; \u00c9derson at Atalanta is another option, although a deal in the summer is considered more likely. The same goes for Juventus full-back Andrea Cambiaso.\n\nLike January, the summer window is likely to be another busy one for City. Among other things, the club are watching closely what happens with Joshua Kimmich and Jamal Musiala as they approach the end of their contracts at Bayern Munich and sources have suggested there could be some big deals on the horizon.\n\nCity have used January to try to save their ailing season; Guardiola will hope they've also taken the first steps towards building his next formidable team.",

    "raw_text": "When the University of Washington retired Kelsey Plum's No. 10 jersey earlier this month, making her the first Huskies women's basketball player with her number in the rafters of Hec Edmundson Pavilion, it was an opportunity for Plum to reflect on the journey that has taken her from UW to the WNBA.\n\n\"I look back now,\" Plum said, \"and it is really cool to have a full-circle moment, look back and say, 'Dang, that was a lot of points. I never really thought about it.' It's cool. I appreciate that time of reflection. I'm really glad that it's been at this point of my life because I'm at a different point of my life than I've ever been.\"\n\nPlum, a two-time WNBA champion and three-time All-Star, isn't alone among WNBA standouts enjoying the opportunity to return as guests of honor to the college campuses where their journeys started. A day after Plum's jersey retirement, 2024 Las Vegas Aces draft pick Elizabeth Kitley had hers retired at Virginia Tech. And this Sunday, Plum's former Las Vegas teammate A'ja Wilson and Caitlin Clark, who broke Plum's record for all-time career scoring in Division I women's basketball, will be honored at South Carolina and Iowa, respectively.\n\nThey'll surely experience similar emotions to what Plum felt seeing her jersey unveiled alongside those of Washington's men's basketball and volleyball stars.\n\n\"When it actually happens, it's kind of like you're in shock a little bit,\" she said. \"I was emotional. There's just so much that goes into a moment like this.\"\n\nWho might be the next former women's college basketball player to get her jersey hoisted to the rafters? Schools don't generally talk about retiring jerseys until they announce it's going to happen, so we don't know what might be in the works around the country. But ESPN's Kendra Andrews, Charlie Creme, Kevin Pelton, Alexa Philippou and Michael Voepel debate who might be next to receive the honor.\n\nWhich player should be next on the list for getting her college jersey retired?\n\nPhilippou: Sabrina Ionescu's No. 20. Oregon doesn't have a lengthy track record of retiring jersey numbers. (In fact, Ionescu's teammate Ruthy Hebard wore No. 24 even though it had technically been retired for the contributions of program great Bev Smith). But honoring Ionescu -- who, in addition to her robust individual accolades, led the program to two Elite Eight appearances plus the 2019 Final Four -- should be a no-brainer for the Ducks. The Oregon legend is the only player in NCAA Division men's or women's basketball history with 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds and 1,000 assists and is the sport's all-time triple-doubles leader with 26.\n\nVoepel: Just as Clark is having her jersey retired now at Iowa, there's no need to wait much longer to retire the jersey of another Iowan: Ashley Joens' No. 24 at Iowa State. Joens is the Cyclones' all-time leading scorer, a record she set in four seasons. In her fifth season (via the COVID-19 waiver), she became one of 16 Division I women's players to hit 3,000 points, finishing with 3,060. She also led Iowa State to the 2023 Big 12 tournament title, just the third in school history.\n\nJoens finished her career in 2023 and was drafted into the WNBA. Iowa State doesn't retire numbers (on the men's or women's side) but does retire jerseys. The four retired for Iowa State's women: Tonya Burns (finished her career in 1985), Jayme Olson (1998), Megan Taylor (2001) and Angie Welle (2002). Joens should be a slam dunk as next.\n\nCreme: Only two women's players at UConn have their jerseys retired: Rebecca Lobo's No. 50 and Swin Cash's No. 32. UConn reserves that honor for only alumni who have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Two more Huskies legends might get the chance soon, as both Sue Bird and Maya Moore are first-time nominees for the 2025 Hall of Fame class. Whether their induction comes this year or in the near future, UConn would likely get those jersey retirement ceremonies on the calendar quickly for two of the best, and most popular, players in Huskies history. Moore is the program's all-time leading scorer, the only three-time Wade Trophy winner in the award's history, and a two-time national champion. Bird was also a two-time champ and won the Wade Trophy as the point guard on the unbeaten 2002 title team considered to be one of the best all time.\n\nPelton: UConn has retired two more numbers than Stanford, which has never done so. I'd like to see that change with No. 30, which could be retired to honor Nneka Ogwumike and Kate Starbird, both national players of the year. Ogwumike was No. 1 when Voepel ranked the greatest players of the Tara VanDerveer era after the legendary coach's retirement last year. She has gone on to become a WNBA MVP and president of the players' association. With due respect to Chris Gobrecht's great UW teams, Puget Sound native Starbird was the defining women's basketball player of the 1990s for me. After seven seasons in the ABL and WNBA, Starbird has made an impact on her second career as a professor at UW studying disinformation.\n\nAndrews: LSU has retired only two jerseys, and the third should be Angel Reese's No. 10. In her two seasons in Baton Rouge, Reese averaged 20.9 points and 14.4 rebounds per game and collected the second-most double-doubles in program history with 61, trailing only Sylvia Fowles. The All-American also led the Tigers to their first NCAA championship in 2023 as the Final Four Most Outstanding Player. Reese continued to make history throughout her WNBA rookie season before a season-ending injury. Reese's legacy at LSU contributed to the skyrocketing interest in women's basketball.\n\nVoepel: We also should mention the Atlanta Dream's Rhyne Howard. But because of Kentucky's stringent rules on jersey retirement, it will be a while. Kentucky has established guidelines for all its sports that to have a jersey retired, athletes must have been in the school's Hall of Fame at least five years. And athletes can't be inducted into that hall until at least five years after they finish their college careers. In short, the earliest Howard could have her jersey retired is 2032, as she finished college at Kentucky in 2022 and was then picked No. 1 in the WNBA draft.\n\nIt seems a shame the wait will be that long for Howard, a two-time SEC player of the year and 2022 league tournament MVP who has gone on to be WNBA Rookie of the Year, a two-time WNBA All-Star and an Olympic bronze medalist in 3x3. Kentucky has only one retired jersey for a women's basketball player: Valerie Still's No. 12. She finished her career in 1983, and her jersey was retired in 2003.\n\nKentucky should add at least one other retired jersey even before Howard is eligible. Consider A'dia Mathies: She graduated in 2013 and entered Kentucky's Hall of Fame in 2019. The program's third-leading scorer behind Still and Howard, Mathies is a two-time SEC player of the year and helped Kentucky make the Elite Eight three times.",

    "raw_text": "The Pro Kabaddi League has come a long, long way since it began with eight teams in 2014. Now in season 10, twelve teams from across the length and breadth of the country play in what has blossomed into India's second-most watched sporting league.\n\nOn PKL's 1000th match on Monday, we take a look back at the last 10 years and pick out the best of the best on a few chosen parameters.\n\nBest Raid: Pardeep Narwal's raid that wiped out a six-man defence\n\nIt began like any other raid, but ended like no other raid.\n\nPardeep darted from the left to the right, faked a dubki to sidestep the defensive chain of Surender Nada and Vikash Kandola. Then, in one swift motion, he swatted away an attempted ankle and back hold before using his left leg to propel him past the two remaining defenders to clean up the Haryana Steelers side of the mat.\n\nSuch is the fanbase for this raid that even today if you search for 'Pardeep Narwal' on YouTube, one of the top results is 'Pardeep Narwal 8 point raid'.\n\nWatch: Pardeep Narwal's eight point raid\n\nMr. Flamboyant\n\nRahul Chaudhari. He has the charisma, the personality and the swagger of a movie star. His charming looks and clinical raiding earned him a humongous fan base, bigger than many of his contemporaries. And he was always flamboyant, he bought the best cars, wore the latest trends and even acted as a jilted lover in a music video.\n\nBest performance by a raider: Pawan Sehrawat unbelievable 39\n\nIt's common for teams to score 39 points in a match. But for an individual to score that many? Surely, you've got to be joking.\n\nEnter Pawan Sehrawat.\n\nBengaluru Bulls were trailing 6-12 to the Haryana Steelers [why are the Steelers always at the receiving end of these incredible performances?] and Pawan produced a raid that would earn him the moniker Hi-Flyer. He leapt about seven feet in the air to beat two defenders...and there was just no stopping him thereon.\n\nHe picked up points for fun, sometimes in collections of three. It was only fitting that when Pawan got to his 39th point, the previous owner of the record for most points in a game, Pardeep, cheered him on from the stands.\n\nBest performance by a defender: Shadloui's magical 19\n\nThe Iranian showman produced not one, not two, but eight Super Tackles! And it was an exhibition of every defensive move he had: ankle hold, front block, double thigh hold, the dash, he did it all.\n\nAnd it wasn't against any other team but the reigning champions, Dabang Delhi. Shadloui made Naveen Kumar, one of PKL's best raiders, look like a novice as he picked his ankles time and again. After tackling Naveen, he went on to do a backward somersault and launched himself back on his feet. After a tackle on another player, he looked down at him flat on the mat, smiled and slapped his thigh with his index finger raised to the sky. It was almost like he was mocking them. The bleach-blonde-haired Iranian loved every moment of it and went on to execute three brilliant raids as well.\n\nBest Move: Dubki\n\nThe most popular move on the kabaddi mat today - the dubki. Shabeer Bapu, One of the OGs, had introduced the League to the move and it was perfected and made notoriously popular by none other than Pardeep Narwal, the Dubki King.\n\nWhat is the dubki? It's a move that commands rubber-band-like elasticity as the raider ducks below a chain of defenders and then launches himself back to his feet.\n\nBest Nickname\n\nSo each of the top players in the PKL is given a nickname, which then becomes commonplace in commentary. Here's a sample: Pardeep Narwal is called the Dubki King, Siddharth Desai earned the moniker Baahubali for his ripped physique and Ajay Thakur was nicknamed the Ice Man for his calm demeanour.\n\nBut the best among the lot, and one that will be remembered for time immemorial is Anup Kumar's nickname -- Bonus ka Badshah, translating to the King of the Bonus. Anup was the best exhibitionist of the getting a bonus point -- where the raider has to cross the bonus line with his front foot and his trailing leg has to be air-borne.\n\nBest Foreigner\n\nFazel Atrachali, without a shred of doubt. He is PKL's most successful captain, has the most tackle points, is a two-time champion and is the best overseas player PKL has seen. I mean, just take a look at his track record:\n\nSeason 2: Made his PKL debut, won the title with U Mumba.\n\nSeason 4: Moved to defending champions Patna, won his second title in three seasons.\n\nSeason 5: Made a switch to Gujarat Giants [ex Gujarat FortuneGiants] and led them to a runners-up finish in their debut season.\n\nSeason 6: Returned to U Mumba, became PKL's most expensive overseas player and finished as the third-best defender with 83 tackle points.\n\nSeason 7: Was the season's best defender.\n\nSeason 9: Joined Puneri Paltan, led them to their first final.\n\nSeason 10: Became PKL's most successful captain and became the first defender to cross 450 tackle points.\n\nMr. Muscle\n\nYou would be forgiven if you saw Maninder Singh for the first time and mistook him for a professional bodybuilder. The man's an absolute tank. He's got boulders for shoulders, logs for quadriceps and is so strong that he sometimes lifts opposition defenders over the midline and into his side of the court. That also explains why he's known as Mighty Mani.\n\nIconic rule introduction\n\nThe Do or Die raid, the one rule that ensured kabaddi games would not be a snoozefest. You see, until this rule was introduced, raiders would go on numerous empty raids and that made for boring viewing. But once this rule came into place, it mandates a raider to score a point after two consecutive empty raids and if he fails to do so, he is eliminated and the opposition is awarded a point.\n\nBest Dialogue\n\nHaryana Steelers coach Manpreet Singh, a former player with three-time champions Patna Pirates, is one of the most outspoken coaches in the PKL. His press conferences are cheeky, sarcastic and filled with idioms and phrases. During PKL9, he was asked if he would re-work his team for the games to come, he quipped: \"Will you replace Virat Kohli? He came in and won the game at the end [in the 2022 ICC T20 World Cup game against Pakistan]. India or Pakistan could have lost that game. Our matches have gone similarly and I don't intend to change the team.\"",

    "raw_text": "Two-thirds of the Pro Kabaddi League's 11th season is done, and with the Noida leg witnessing 44 tightly contested games, we are closer to finding out who will make the playoffs as the season concludes in Pune.\n\nHaryana Steelers have been the only consistent force so far, but with seven other teams in the mix for the other five playoff spots - and three having an outside chance - it's been a thrilling season of kabaddi.\n\nHere's how every team has performed this season so far (grades only for the second leg in Noida):\n\nHaryana Steelers\n\nGrade: A+\n\nFrom seventh in the table after the Hyderabad leg, Manpreet Singh's Steelers have simply rocketed up the standings to first, opening a nine-point lead to boot. Eight wins from nine games in Noida have been the cause, with the loss to the Telugu Titans their only blemish.\n\nThey were already the league's best defensive outfit, and Mohammadreza Shadloui's stellar form (51 tackle points) has meant it's incredibly hard to score on the Steelers. Raiding was a bit of an issue in Hyderabad, but the trio of Vinay (108 points), Shivam Patare (89 points) and Shadloui (87 points) have ensured that they have become the most feared outfit in the league.\n\nSteelers ended the Noida leg with a point differential of +78 from their eight wins, and the next seven in Pune seem all set for another spell of victories. The playoffs are all but a certainty, and should they keep up their form, Manpreet Singh's side look all set to bring home a first title.\n\nPatna Pirates\n\nGrade: A\n\nPatna Pirates have flown up the table with five wins from eight in Noida - but it's been the manner of those wins that have left jaws dropped. They earned a massive +85 point difference from those wins, even while the Noida leg also saw them lose two and tie one.\n\nIt's easy enough to explain the Pirates' form - they have the league's best scorer in Devank Dalal (194 points) and alongside Ayan Lohchab (128 points) they have the best raiding unit in PKL 11. This youthful left-right pairing have been a destructive force that are rarely halted. However, the Paltan's focus on scoring hasn't stopped defenders like Ankit Jaglan from collecting an impressive 47 tackle points.\n\nThese pages said the title was unlikely for this outfit at the end of the Hyderabad leg but given Devank's consistency (11 Super 10s from 15 games), they have quite the chance when they do make the playoffs. Let's put it this way, the Pirates are a team most want to avoid; and that only speaks volumes of how good they've been.\n\nDabang Delhi\n\nGrade: A-\n\nThree ties, three wins - Dabang Delhi left Noida extending their season's unbeaten run to eight, thanks in no small part to Naveen Kumar's return. This doesn't mean that Ashu Malik has slowed down to let the Naveen Express by, if anything he's only been buoyed to greater heights, with 12 Super 10s from 15 games - the best in the league.\n\nWith 164 raid points, he's the second-best in the league, and Dabang Delhi's climb from fourth to third in the standings signifies that they can take on quality defence in the playoffs. Yogesh Dahiya's defensive prowess has meant that even when the raiding unit doesn't work, Delhi still are in with a chance, as evidenced by their penchant for ties.\n\nTheir final seven games in Pune aren't the easiest, but Delhi have the calibre to beat anyone on their day - which should be enough to make the playoffs.\n\nTelugu Titans\n\nGrade: B\n\nThe Titans are capable of inflicting a massive 22-point loss on league leaders Haryana Steelers without their talisman Pawan Sehrawat one day and then go on to lose to second-from-bottom Gujarat Giants five days later. It's no secret that Pawan's absence has been felt of late, despite four wins in Noida from seven. It's an inconsistency that's seen them go from second to fourth, although they remain quite likely to make the playoffs.\n\nIncredibly Pawan's 95 points from 9 games still has him in the top 10 point-scorers of the league, despite others playing six games more. Vijay Malik has taken up primary raiding duties in Pawan's absence and has the same number of Super 10s now (6) while eclipsing him in points (126). Sagar Sethpal Rawal remains a powerhouse in defence, although the Titans remain worryingly likely to concede all-outs (they are the second worst in the league).\n\nStill, this is a far cry from last season, and Krishan Kumar Hooda deserves credit for fashioning an outfit that looks all set to make the playoffs.\n\nPuneri Paltan\n\nGrade: D\n\nThe rails have come off the Paltan in the Noida leg, with the defending champions dropping from first place at the end of the Hyderabad leg to fifth in Noida. They got just two wins from seven and they came against Bengal Warriors and Gujarat Giants who 10th and 11th in the standings. Two losses to the Panthers, a blowout loss against table-toppers Steelers and two costly ties against Delhi and the Yoddhas have seen Puneri Paltan plummet in the standings.\n\nAslam Inamdar's injury has been a bridge too far for the defending champions, even if Pankaj Mohite claims otherwise - and his 75 points have been quietly impressive. However, the defence has struggled (aside from Gaurav Khatri), even though they have been second best in the league at inflicting all-outs. It would be the quite the surprise if they miss out on the playoffs, but if the downward trend continues, that could be a possibility for the defending champions.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers\n\nGrade: B\n\nJaipur won five of their eight games in Noida, including impressive victories twice over the Telugu Titans and Puneri Paltan. However, it's the blowout losses to Dabang Delhi and Haryana Steelers that raise questions about their ability against the league's best teams.\n\nArjun Deshwal became the second-youngest player ever to cross the 1100 raid point mark and is the third-best raider in the league currently (165 points, 7 Super 10s). His consistency is a bankable option for coach Sanjeev Baliyan, who has seen his defence struggle against top raiders. Should they make the playoffs, which is fairly likely, Jaipur will have to ensure that their defensive prowess matches that of Deshwal if they are to win the title.\n\nU Mumba\n\nGrade: C\n\nOn paper, U Mumba may be seventh in the table, but it's a bit of a misnomer since they have played one game fewer than the six teams above. Win that, and U Mumba climb to third - which is where they were at the end of the Hyderabad leg. It's a testament to how tight the league is, and U Mumba are becoming specialists at narrow wins. Their four wins in Noida only came via a +8 point differential, and it's that penchant for keeping their nerve that could prove crucial in the playoffs.\n\nCaptain Sunil Kumar's young guns, led by Ajit Chouhan (114 points, 5 Super 10s) are the league's dark horses, since they can surprise anyone on their day. However, the two losses to Telugu Titans in Noida should give Iranian coach Gholamreza Mazandarani pause, as should a blowout loss against league leaders Haryana Steelers.\n\nUP Yoddhas\n\nGrade: B-\n\nTenth after the Hyderabad leg, eighth after the Noida leg - the UP Yoddhas have improved a fair bit, and with four wins and a tie from seven games in front of their home crowd, they have a shot at the playoffs, only trailing sixth place by three points and with a game in hand.\n\nBharat Hooda's form has been crucial to the Yoddhas' uptick in fortunes - he's the second-best all-rounder in the league so far, although he's mainly scored with his raiding. Bhavani Rajput's raiding (78 points) and Sumit Sangwan's tackling prowess (47 points) have backed up Hooda's feats, and after impressive wins over the Panthers, Titans and Pirates, it seems like the Yoddhas might actually make the playoffs this season.\n\nTamil Thalaivas\n\nGrade: D\n\nThe Tamil Thalaivas maddening inconsistency continued in Noida, where they lost to the UP Yoddhas by 16 points and then defeated the same team by 14 points four days later. The Thalaivas have a 13-point deficit to the playoff spots, with only seven games remaining - which ought to see them miss out.\n\nNarender Kandola and Sachin Tanwar's raiding form has dipped, which has seen them drop from 5th and 6th in the raid point rankings to 13th and 20th. Kandola's injury further complicates matters, since it's clear that this is the area where the Thalaivas have suffered. Nitesh Kumar's 51 tackle points (one shy of the league's best) has seen the franchise earn the most tackle points in the league (183). Moein Shafaghi's recent form could see the Thailavas make a bid for the playoff spots, but it seems unlikely at the moment.\n\nBengal Warriorz\n\nGrade: F\n\nBengal Warriorz have crashed from fifth in the standings at the end of the Hyderabad leg to tenth currently. Noida proved an unhappy hunting ground, as the Warriorz lost all seven of their games here, with a score difference of -79 seeing them plummet down the table.\n\nNitin Kumar has emerged as the team's best raider, even though Maninder Singh became only the second player in PKL history to cross 1500 raid points in their most recent game. Along with Fazel Atrachali, the Warriorz's big names have performed relatively well, but the lack of impact from the supporting cast as well as unfortunate choices in the closing moments have seen them go on a seven-game losing streak. Even if the Pune leg witnesses a change in fortunes, they may be too far gone to earn a playoff spot.\n\nGujarat Giants\n\nGrade: C\n\nGujarat Giants have bounced back quite well in Noida, winning three and tying one of their eight games, but the damage done in Hyderabad has meant they are unlikely to make the playoff spots. To overcome a gap of 20 points with eight games left might just be too much.\n\nCoach Ram Meher Singh can give thanks to the Bengal Warriorz for this uptick in fortunes, with two wins against them in Noida. Guman Singh starred in those wins, and it's no surprise that he's finally repaying the amount spent on him to climb to eighth in the points scored rankings (110). The Giants finally look like a cohesive outfit, and while they may not be in the playoffs themselves, they could prove pivotal in deciding who gets there.\n\nBengaluru Bulls\n\nGrade: F\n\nThe Bulls played seven games in Noida and lost all of them. Only their two matches against U Mumba were close, losing the first by a point and the next by two, but for most of the season, they've been blown away by the opposition. They've conceded the most points in the league (595), and the next worse team is better off by 60 points.\n\nIt's a testimony to their lack of options that Pardeep Narwal is their top-scoring raider with 68 points - a total bettered by 18 other raiders in the league. Nitin Rawal is a lone bright spot, leading the league in tackle points (52), but the Bulls penchant for conceding all-outs means they're unlikely to finish anything but last come the end of the season.",

Kelsey Mitchell is staying put with the Indiana Fever.\n\nNone of it is official until Saturday, when free agents can begin to sign contracts. But the destinations for some of the biggest WNBA free agents have been confirmed for their 2025 destinations.\n\nThanks to some high-profile trades earlier this week, guard Jewell Loyd is headed to the Las Vegas Aces, guard Kelsey Plum to the Los Angeles Sparks, forward Alyssa Thomas to the Phoenix Mercury and guard Natasha Cloud to the Connecticut Sun.\n\nTwo other prominent free agents -- Breanna Stewart with the New York Liberty and Nneka Ogwumike with the Seattle Storm -- are expected to remain with their 2024 teams. And Phoenix's Diana Taurasi and the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne have not officially announced their plans for 2025; both might retire.\n\nBut there are still a lot of key players to be signed who could make an impact on the 2025 WNBA season. Here are some of the biggest free agents by position we will be watching.\n\nTop guards\n\nChennedy Carter, Chicago Sky: She has had her ups and downs since being drafted No. 4 in 2020 by Atlanta. She played 27 games in two seasons with the Dream, 24 in the one season with Los Angeles, sat out the 2023 season and returned to the league in 2024 with Chicago. She played 33 games with the Sky last season, averaging 17.5 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.1 assists. Carter is not a strong 3-point shooter, making just 24 of 82 in her WNBA career. Despite that, she's still a dynamic scorer who can create something out of nothing. Carter's talent is there but teams might be wary of how she fits in chemistry-wise and style-wise. -- Michael Voepel\n\nDiJonai Carrington, Connecticut Sun: Because Carrington is a restricted free agent, the Sun can match any offer sheet she signs with another team. But all RFA offer sheets have to be for a minimum of two years. Carrington probably will return for the Sun for a year or leave in a sign-and-trade deal. Last season saw a massive jump in Carrington's production. She went from averaging 8.3 points to 12.7, 17.2 minutes to 29.6 and started all 39 games in which she played. She carved out a role for herself with the Sun but could still want a change of scenery for her fifth season. -- Kendra Andrews\n\nTop wings/small forwards\n\nSatou Sabally, Dallas Wings: Where Sabally ends up could determine the next landing spots for others, though technically she will have to be moved via trade since she was designated as a core player by the Wings. Sabally has been linked to the Mercury -- who already have a new look for 2025 with the acquisition of Thomas and the departures of Cloud, Griner and Bec Allen -- and the defending champion New York Liberty, where her sister, Nyara, plays. Satou has dealt with injuries throughout her career (including a shoulder issue in 2024) but had her best season in 2023, when she won Most Improved Player and earned an all-WNBA first-team selection. -- Alexa Philippou\n\nDeWanna Bonner, Connecticut Sun: Signs point toward Bonner leaving the Sun, particularly after the news that teammates Thomas (also her fianc\u00e9e) and Jones are headed to Phoenix and Atlanta, respectively. Could Bonner end up in the Valley alongside Thomas? That would mark a homecoming after she spent the first decade of her career there. Bonner is one of the older players in the league at 37, but with two consecutive All-Star appearances (and three overall in Connecticut), she still makes an impact and knows what it takes to win a championship. -- Philippou\n\nTop power forwards/centers\n\nEmma Meesseman: The 2019 WNBA Finals MVP with Washington, Meesseman has not played in the WNBA the past two years. Her most recent season was 2022 with Chicago. The 6-foot-4 forward is a longtime member of the Belgian national team and has played extensively overseas. That has taken her away from the WNBA, but she is expected to play this year. She turns 32 three days before the WNBA season starts and is a dependable, versatile veteran who can fit any system. Connecticut and Minnesota seem her most likely destinations. -- Voepel",

    "raw_text": "Long balls killed English soccer, so English soccer killed the long ball. At least, that's how the story goes.\n\nOne of the sport's first true analysts, the Royal Air Force accountant Charles Reep, would attend games while wearing a miner's helmet, equipped with a tiny little headlamp. He had a feeling something was wrong with the way soccer was being played. Too many short passes, he thought. Stop messing about and kick the ball up near the goal. But like any good accountant, he knew he couldn't trust his instincts until he had some cold, hard data that proved him right.\n\nBack in the 1950s, most stadiums didn't illuminate the stands, so Reep used his miner's helmet to light up the notebook he'd bring to every game. He created his own kind of hieroglyphics, a near-unintelligible shorthand that allowed him to record, by hand, everything that happened over the course of a match. And once he created a big enough dataset with his scribblings, he confirmed his initial suspicions: more goals were scored from possessions with fewer passes -- in other words, quickly moving the ball upfield with a long ball -- than possessions with more passes.\n\nNow, Reep fell prey to some faulty math. More goals were scored from possessions with fewer passes because there were more of these possessions in every match. But a higher percentage of the many-pass possessions led to goals. No one seemed to realize this at the time, and Reep's theories gained purchase within the English game, most notably with the young manager Graham Taylor. He came to similar ideas on his own but then doubled-down on Reep's data, using the long-ball game to launch Watford all the way up from the fourth division to as high up as second place in the first division. His success with Watford led to Taylor eventually being named England manager -- and then it all fell apart.\n\nUnder Taylor, England failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, and everyone blamed the duo's unsophisticated ideas around relying on long balls. The Sun published a picture of Taylor's face on a turnip days after England were eliminated. And various criticisms of Reep's nerdy philosophy trickled out over the next two decades. As one headline put it: \"How One Man's Bad Math Helped Ruin Decades Of English Soccer.\"\n\nReep's one mistake overshadowed a life of ideas that were ahead of their time. Along with another analyst, Richard Pollard, he developed early expected goals and possession value models -- long before anyone even cared to count shots or corner kicks. Their core ideas about how soccer worked were mostly correct: accept randomness, get the ball near the goal as much as possible, shoot as often as you can. And you know what?\n\nIf Liverpool's current place at the top of the table and Bournemouth's shocking challenge for a Champions League place contention are any indication, they might have been on to something with the long balls, too. The long ball is still viewed as unsophisticated and is unpopular in the Premier League, but some of the most successful teams this season are using the tactic the most. What gives?\n\nHow the Premier League killed the long ball\n\nMy words are not necessary. Just look at this chart:\n\nThat's every season since 2008-09, in chronological order, and how many times a player on any team attempted a pass of 35 yards or more.\n\nIt's not a totally linear decline, but in 2008-09, Premier League teams attempted 51,112 long passes. Last year, that number was all the way down to 38,493. The shifts aren't really notable from year to year, but if you've been watching the Premier League since 2008, you've seen more than 10,000 long balls disappear from the game.\n\nAnd if anything, that's underselling the scale of change. Because, over the same time frame, the number of total passes attempted in the Premier League has increased:\n\nThe percentage of passes that are long balls, then, has undergone an even steeper decline. And more than halfway through this current season, Premier League teams are going long at a lower rate than ever before -- at least in the Stats Perform dataset:\n\nThe reasons for the shift are clear. Even going back to the Taylor and Reep era, teams in the rest of Europe tended to play a more possession-based game than England's hit-and-run style. Over time, though, the riches of the Premier League attracted more and more foreign coaches and foreign players.\n\nIn 2005, Arsenal's French coach, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, fielded the league's first totally foreign starting 11. That same year, Liverpool, under Spanish manager Rafael Benitez, won England's first Champions League title since 1999 -- and they were only the second English club to even make the final since 1985 (when UEFA banned English clubs from continental competition for five years after the Heysel Stadium disaster). That started a run of at least one English club reaching the European Cup final in six of seven seasons.\n\nSpurred on by the success of their senior teams, English clubs and the national team system, too, started to prioritize technical development in their academies. Today, England is producing pass-happy playmakers who would've been totally unrecognizable to fans of the national team 30 years ago.\n\nSince 2008-09, there has been a relatively strong negative correlation between long balls attempted and points won in the Premier League. The only outlier in that trend was the 2019-20 season, which was interrupted by COVID-19 and then played amidst bizarre circumstances. But in other words, for every season that wasn't paused because of a pandemic, teams that played fewer long balls tended to win more points, and teams that played more long balls tended to win fewer points.\n\nThat is, until this season.\n\nWhy the long ball is cool in the Premier League again\n\nIt might seem contradictory, but I assure you: two things can be true at once. There are fewer long balls being played in the Premier League this season than ever before. And yet, some of the best teams in the league play more long balls than their competitors.\n\nIf we start at the top, Liverpool are clearly the best team in the league: points, goals, expected goals, eye test, betting odds. Whatever the metric, Arne Slot's squad is the class of the league. And yet, they're attempting a league-average number of long balls. Per data from PFF FC, Liverpool have attempted 378 over-the-top passes, i.e. balls played over and into space behind the back line.\n\nThat's tied for the league lead with their opponents this weekend, Bournemouth. Andoni Iraola's side is tied for sixth in points, tied for fourth in goal differential and alone in third for expected goal differential. They've already beaten Arsenal and Manchester City, and they've destroyed Newcastle and Nottingham Forest by a combined 9-1 scoreline over the past two weeks. Oh, and they've done it while attempting the second-most long balls of any team in the league.\n\nForest, of course, are still alone in third in the table, and they've attempted more of what PFF FC calls \"contested passes,\" which are usually above head height and played into an area where a player will have to compete to win the ball. And while second-place Arsenal rank low in overall long balls attempted, recent analysis from Statsbomb's Jaymes Monte found their long balls to be the most effective in the league. They also rank in the middle of the pack for balls over the top and contested passes attempted. And the only teams that go long on goal kicks more often than Arsenal are Everton and, yes, Forest and Bournemouth.\n\nFlip it all around, and 15th-place Tottenham almost never go long on goal kicks and attempt the fewest long balls of any team in the league. Southampton are one of the worst teams the league has ever seen, and they're attempting the fifth-fewest long balls of anyone.\n\nManchester City, perhaps the league's biggest underachievers relative to preseason expectations, play the second-fewest long balls, the second-fewest balls over the top and the fewest contested passes. But at least last weekend against Chelsea, they too seemed to find value in booting it long. They attempted 53 long balls -- six more than in any game this season -- and they won 3-1. All three of their goals came from long passes.\n\nWas this the start of a shift in approach? A recognition from Pep Guardiola, the high priest of the short pass, that everyone above them in the table was finding success by finding a way to kick it long? We'll get an answer on Sunday, when Man City travel to North London to take on Arsenal.\n\nRegardless of what it means for City, though, the Premier League has gone through a steady revolution: long passes are disappearing from the game, year after year. But whenever the homogenization of strategy pushes too far in one direction, it opens up space for what was once thought to be an inefficient, brutish approach to suddenly become a path to victory.\n\nWe've seen running teams flourish in the NFL as most of the league has embraced the forward pass, and amidst the NBA's obsession with 3-pointers, some of the most valuable players in the league are the ones who can convert tough shots inside the 3-point line. Perhaps the Premier League has accidentally created a space where just the right number of long balls can win you lots of games.\n\nAs Richard Pollard put it to me a few years ago: \"The best way to get the ball into the attacking third from your own half, or from midfield, is a long, high pass in the air aimed to land just inside the penalty area or out wide so the goalkeeper can't get it, forcing defenders to head under pressure. It has a zero-percent chance of being intercepted along the way and an excellent chance of leading to a 'regained possession' in the attacking third from which most goals arise.\n\n\"Leading football back into the dark ages was how it was described, but it did OK for Watford.\"\n\nAnd for at least this season, it has done OK for a bunch of other Premier League teams, too.",

    "raw_text": "Fantasy baseball managers tend to get a bit too excited about prospects, as for every Corbin Carroll and Paul Skenes who excel, there are myriad disappointments such as Jordan Walker and Jack Leiter. Those fellows and so many other youngsters might still eventually work out, but they didn't help much last season.\n\nBaseball is a hard game for most young players. Still, fantasy managers are often so desperate to secure the next breakout star and focused on how these newcomers haven't yet failed at the major league level that they generally overrate them when compared with productive, \"boring\" veterans.\n\nAs we highlight the top prospects for the pending 2025 fantasy baseball season, we must remember that for fantasy purposes, opportunity is a big deal. Really, it might be the biggest deal, because all the players are talented. Experts on prospects tout skills and polish more than anything else -- as they should -- but everything matters. Fantasy managers need to covet the pure hitting/pitching numbers as well as the timelines. After all some (in fact, many) of the top prospects will not deliver MLB numbers for years.\n\n2025's top fantasy baseball prospects\n\nRanked for fantasy value in 2025 only\n\n1. Roki Sasaki, SP, Los Angeles Dodgers: The numbers in Japan were outstanding, with a 2.02 ERA, a 0.88 WHIP and a high strikeout rate over more than 400 innings across four seasons. Few seem concerned about Sasaki, 23, being able to handle MLB hitters, especially after he signed with the progressive Dodgers, but the better question might be about how many he gets to handle.\n\nSasaki has made only 33 starts over his past two seasons, succumbing to various injuries, both related and not related to his valuable right arm. No Dodgers pitcher has thrown 150 IPs in a season since 2022, and a six-man rotation, led by the great Shohei Ohtani, seems likely, sensible and designed to keep everyone healthy. Covet Sasaki, but there is both durability and volume risk here.\n\n2. Dylan Crews, OF, Washington Nationals: Crews, 22, debuted for Washington during the final week of August, and while the .218 batting average and .641 OPS over 132 plate appearances might not impress, the nine extra-base hits, 8.3% walk rate and 12 stolen bases in 15 attempts tell a more positive story. Crews is going to be a terrific real-life and fantasy option. He may lack the same first-round fantasy upside of Paul Skenes, his LSU teammate, but there is nothing wrong with 15-20 HRs, 30-plus SBs and plenty of playing time.\n\n3. Matthew Shaw, 3B/2B, Chicago Cubs: Shaw, 23, might get an immediate chance to earn the team's open 3B job after hitting .284 with 21 homers and 31 steals at two minor league levels in 2024. The Maryland product hits baseballs hard and with launch angle. Now all he needs is a strong spring training to earn a big league starting role.\n\n4. Jasson Dominguez, OF, New York Yankees: Dominguez, 21, has been on the fantasy radar for several years but retains rookie eligibility after playing just a handful of MLB games over the past two seasons, which were compromised by Tommy John surgery in September 2023. Dominguez is the leading contender to start for the Yankees in left field. As with Crews and Shaw, a multi-skilled, 20-HR, 20-SB player lurks, though he likely hits lower in the batting order for New York than those fellows will for their teams.\n\n5. Coby Mayo, 1B/3B, Baltimore Orioles: Mayo, 23, proved himself at Triple-A Norfolk over the past two seasons, hitting 34 home runs with a .919 OPS across 151 games and 657 PA. Ignore his brief work with the Orioles this past season, when he managed only four singles in 41 at-bats (.098) with 22 strikeouts. Mayo is far better than that. The Orioles boast the depth to be patient with Jackson Holliday (not rookie eligible, by the way) and Jordan Westburg as likely infield starters. Still, Mayo should see his chances in the majors again.\n\n6. Roman Anthony, OF, Boston Red Sox: Anthony, 20, might be a better prospect than the players listed ahead of him, but this modest ranking is about playing time. Anthony boasts only 35 games and 164 PAs for Triple-A Worcester and Boston's current outfield appears set with Jarren Duran, Ceddanne Rafaela. an effective RF platoon of Wilyer Abreu/Rob Refsnyder and Masataka Yoshida at DH. Anthony boasts 30-HR, 30-SB potential -- a monster statistical ceiling -- and all he needs is a chance, but it might not come until midsummer.\n\n7. Kristian Campbell, 2B, Boston Red Sox: Campbell, 22, was a modest fourth-round pick out of Georgia Tech in 2023, but he became one of baseball's top prospects in 2024 when he hit .330 with a .997 OPS, 20 homers and 24 steals across three minor league levels. Like Anthony, even though he might not need it, Campbell should start 2025 at Triple-A Worcester. However, second base in Boston might not necessarily be blocked by Vaughn Grissom and David Hamilton. With a strong spring, Campbell could be in the mix.\n\n8. Emmanuel Rodriguez, OF, Minnesota Twins: Rodriguez, 21, elicits strong opinions in the prospect world after an abbreviated 2024 campaign in which he showed power, plate discipline, swing-and-miss tendencies and issues with staying healthy across four minor league levels. Few debate what Rodriguez is capable of at the plate. The power is real, when Rodriguez makes contact. The Twins might not be in a hurry to promote him to the majors, but after a quiet offseason, there is little blocking his path.\n\n9. Dalton Rushing, C, Los Angeles Dodgers: Rushing, 23, has sped through the minor leagues with relative ease, showing both power upside and plate discipline. The Dodgers utilized him quite a bit in left field at Triple-A Oklahoma City to prepare him for 2025. The Dodgers are set with Will Smith at catcher, but if Rushing can see semi-regular playing time in left with occasional starts behind the plate and hit as he did in 2024 (.896 OPS, 26 HRs), he could be a top-10 catcher for fantasy.\n\n10. Jackson Jobe, SP, Detroit Tigers: Pitchers are far riskier for injuries than hitters and with organizations so cautious with their initial innings and overall volume, it's tougher for them to deliver immediate fantasy value. OK, so Paul Skenes was awesome. Don't expect Jobe, Rangers RHP Kumar Rocker, Phillies RHP Andrew Painter, Pirates RHP Bubba Chandler or any other rookie pitchers to perform at that fantastic level for six months. Yes, Sasaki is also technically an MLB rookie, but he is far more experienced. Jobe, 22, should make Detroit's rotation, but don't expect him to approach 120 IPs.",

Even Connor McDavid, who has surpassed the Pittsburgh Penguins center as the best player in the league, has said that job should still belong to Crosby.\n\nMcDavid, Edmonton's captain, and Colorado's Cale Makar will be the alternate captains.\n\n\"Sidney, Connor and Cale all possess exceptional leadership qualities, a determination to be the best and a burning desire to win,\" coach Jon Cooper said. \"We are fortunate to have incredible leadership on our team. These players will lead Canada with pride as we set out to accomplish our goal of winning.\"\n\nThat took a shot when Pietrangelo withdrew \"to tend to an ailment and prepare for the remainder of the regular season with Vegas,\" the Golden Knights said.\n\nAmong the options to replace him is Los Angeles Kings defenseman Drew Doughty, who on Wednesday made his season debut after breaking his left ankle during an exhibition game in September. Doughty was teammates with Crosby in '10, '14 and '16.\n\nSweden\n\nLike Matthews, Hedman is new to being a captain in the NHL, succeeding Steven Stamkos in the role with the Tampa Bay Lightning for this season. This is a different kind of challenge for the 2021 playoff MVP, who mystifyingly left Sweden's roster for the Sochi Olympics 11 years ago.\n\n\"This is obviously a short tournament, so you've got to hit the ground running from the start, and it's not just going to be the guys wearing the letters,\" Hedman said. \"It's going to be on the whole team to get together right away and try and find our identity as a team. We're just fortunate to have a lot of great leaders and great hockey players, and we are super excited to get together and get this thing going.\"\n\nSweden on Wednesday selected Philadelphia's Sam Ersson as the replacement for injured New Jersey goaltender Jacob Markstrom. General manager Josef Boumedienne and coach Sam Hallam might also need to get another forward if Vegas' William Karlsson can't play and another defenseman if Minnesota's Jonas Brodin is unavailable.\n\nA night after scouting Ersson during a Flyers game earlier this month, they were in Washington and spoke with Capitals defenseman Rasmus Sandin afterward. It's unclear how far down the list of possibilities Sandin might be.\n\nFinland\n\nThe Finnish Ice Hockey Association announced Heiskanen is out after getting injured in the game between Dallas and Vegas earlier this week. That decision was made after GM Jere Lehtinen spoke with Stars management and Heiskanen.\n\n\"This is really sad news, first and foremost for Miro himself, but of course also for the Finnish 4 Nations Face-Off team and Dallas,\" Finland coach Antti Pennanen said. \"We don't know the details of the injury yet, but we hope that Miro will be back in playing condition as soon as possible.\"\n\nLehtinen said a replacement for Heiskanen, one of the sport's top players at the position, will be announced before the team gathers in Montreal and practices for the first time on Feb. 10.\n\n\"He's that type of player that any team in the world would love to have,\" Barkov said. \"He is a leader defensively and really good offensively, so he's a huge part of Team Finland's success. ... All the best and try and get back as soon as possible and as healthy as possible. Health is the most important thing.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.",

    "raw_text": "Season 11 of the Pro Kabaddi League is in full swing, and with the Hyderabad leg witnessing 44 tightly contested games, the narratives of PKL 11 have already emerged.\n\n25 of those games ended with a score difference of less than seven, indicating that there's no dominant force this year, and the prize of the playoffs is still up for grabs.\n\nHere's how every team has performed this season so far:\n\nPuneri Paltan\n\nGrade: A-\n\nNot many teams can deal with Mohammadreza Shadloui leaving their team and not even miss a beat, but the defending champions have picked up where they've left off from last season. They've not appeared as invincible as PKL 10, with losses to both Tamil Thalaivas and Telugu Titans as well as a tie against Bengal Warriorz in their opening eight games, but they still lead the way in the standings.\n\nEvery win has been massive, and owed in large part to defender Gaurav Khatri, who leads the league in tackle points, ably supported by Puneri's paltan of raiders and all-rounders - Aslam Inamdar, Mohit Goyat and Pankaj Mohite continuing where they left off from last season. Another title may not be as much of a certainty, but they are dead certs for the playoffs.\n\nTelugu Titans\n\nGrade: A\n\nEven if these very pages had predicted that Telugu Titans wouldn't be the pushovers they were the previous few years, no one could have seen this coming. Led by a resurgent Pawan Sehrawat (who's balancing raiding and defensive duties with equal aplomb this season), the Titans are now in second place, off the back of four consecutive wins - a feat they'd never achieved since PKL 5.\n\nPawan's 91 points are the second-best this season, but it's those around him that have shored up Krishan Kumar Hooda's turnaround of the Titans. Vijay Malik is an able deputy in raiding duties, Sagar Sethpal Rawal, Ajit Pawar and Krishan Dhull defended well when it mattered. However, the Titans have conceded the most all-outs this season, and have given up the most raid points barring Dabang Delhi in the league, so Hooda still has work to do.\n\nU Mumba\n\nGrade: A\n\nPKL's shift towards youth is best exemplified by U Mumba, who've handed the spotlight to multiple debutants this year, and it's resulted in a promising start to the season. Ably led by the experienced Sunil Kumar, U Mumba's young guns have lived up to their promise - and they are now third in the standings, having played a game fewer than the top two.\n\nLeading the way is the raiding performance of Ajit Chouhan, who was instrumental in wins over the Patna Pirates and Jaipur Pink Panthers. He credits his captain for giving him freedom, and it's paid off. Iranian coach Gholamreza Mazandarani is moulding a handy little outfit here - and expect them to surprise many this season.\n\nDabang Delhi\n\nGrade: C\n\nDespite being fourth in the standings, Dabang Delhi's presence up the field is only because they've played nine games (the rest of the field have played seven/eight). They can be overtaken by five teams below them in the table with a solitary win, which also underlines how tight the PKL has been this season. They have more losses than they have wins (5 vs 4), and a concerning tendency to give up points at crucial moments - they have the second-worst defensive record in the league.\n\nThe losses to Bengaluru Bulls and Patna Pirates ought to have stung, especially since Ashu Malik's raiding performances have deserved more (he leads PKL 11 in raid points and points overall while having eight super 10s in nine games). Naveen Kumar's return will naturally help in raiding duties, and Joginder Narwal will count on him to guide them to a playoff spot.\n\nBengal Warriorz\n\nGrade: B-\n\nThe big names at the Bengal Warriorz have not disappointed so far in PKL 11. 'Mighty' Maninder Singh has racked up the points in the raids and Fazel Atrachali has the third-highest average tackle points in the league so far. The Iranian also made history by becoming the first player in league history to reach 500 tackle points.\n\nAnd yet, it's been Nitin Kumar in only his second PKL season, who's proved crucial to their strategy. The 1-2 raiding punch of Maninder and Nitin has worked incredibly well, as the Warriorz have pulled off impressive wins such as those over the Haryana Steelers. The two ties against U Mumba and Puneri Paltan could have easily been wins, and the additional four points would have seen them top the table. Yet, the stats show they're not topping any charts as a team, and that's perhaps what's missing from their push to win this year's title.\n\nPatna Pirates\n\nGrade: B+\n\nPatna Pirates have scored an average of 37.43 points this season - better than any team in PKL 11, yet find themselves in sixth place. Their scoring prowess is easily explained - the youthful left-right pairing of Devank Dalal (87 points) and Ayan Lohchab (54 points) has been one of the best raiding units in the PKL this year, with them contributing to 54% of the Pirates points so far.\n\nTheir place in the standings is probably because the Pirates have had a tough run of fixtures, losing to defending champions Puneri Paltan, the resurgent Telugu Titans and U Mumba - who are 1,2,3 in the standings. While they are unlikely to add to their three titles this year, they stand a good chance if their balanced squad continues to produce.\n\nHaryana Steelers\n\nGrade: B\n\nAnother misnomer in terms of standings, since last year's finalists have only played six games so far, the fewest of the league (along with Gujarat Giants). Aside from a demoralizing opening day loss to defending champions Puneri Paltan, the Steelers' only other defeat came in a narrow 38-40 loss to a Warriorz side riding on big performances from their star names.\n\nWidely considered the best defensive outfit in the league after the addition of Mohammadreza Shadloui, the Steelers have backed it up with the numbers - conceding the least amount of points and the third-highest average tackle points. However, raiding has been an issue with the fewest points in the league. Vinay has been ably supported by Shadloui while raiding, but coach Manpreet Singh has to tweak his defence-first formula if the Steelers are to win their first title this year.\n\nTamil Thalaivas\n\nGrade: C\n\nThey spent big in the auction and much was expected from this side, but eighth place after the Hyderabad leg surely places some pressure on their coaching setup. They have a superb raiding unit in Narender Kandola and Sachin Tanwar (5th and 6th in the points table), and the fourth-highest points per game in the league as a team.\n\nDefensively, the Thalaivas are second only to Puneri Paltan in tackle points, but also leak points like a sieve. A team of contrasts, the Thalaivas pulled off a superb win over Puneri Paltan but also conspired to lose against Bengaluru Bulls. It's that sort of inconsistency that places their playoff spot under threat. Sort it, and they'll be one of the best teams in the league.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers\n\nGrade: C\n\nAnother one of the teams who can defeat and lose to anyone in the league, Jaipur PP's inconsistencies have been in sharp contrast to their star raider, Arjun Deshwal. He became the second-fastest to 1000 PKL points in the league's history, and starred in all three of their wins over the Warriorz, Titans and Yoddhas this season.\n\nOne of the best raiders in the league, and a defensive setup that tackles with a league-high success rate - all for ninth place. Coach Sanjeev Baliyan remains baffled by his team's rollercoaster form, but is still placing faith in his specialists and not his all-rounders. It's a recipe for this middling form continuing, and he ought to change it.\n\nUP Yoddhas\n\nGrade: C-\n\nThe prevailing opinion was that Pardeep Narwal was holding back this franchise, and after beginning the season with two wins, it appeared true. Things have gone pear-shaped since, and it's telling that Yoddhas' three wins this season have come against Dabang Delhi, Bulls and the Giants - three very unimpressive teams so far.\n\nBharat Hooda has been the lone bright spark for this team, but it seems unlikely that they will trouble the playoff places this year.\n\nBengaluru Bulls\n\nGrade: D\n\nPardeep Narwal is a spent force, and all the talk of a homecoming sparking an uptick in his form has well and truly dissipated now. There are flashes of brilliance still, such as the crucial all-out inflicted on Dabang Delhi in their first win of the season. It's increasingly rare however, and the Bulls simply can't rely on him for consistent point-scoring.\n\nJai Bhagwan and Ajinkya Pawar have battled bravely, and were impressive in the team's only other win of the season against Tamil Thalaivas, but the writing is already on the wall for this side. Six losses from the first eight games of the season is irredeemable - however you swing it.\n\nGujarat Giants\n\nGrade: F\n\nThe Giants only win of the season has come against the similarly poor Bulls, and they've been handed big losses in their other games. They spent big on Guman Singh, who's been serviceable, but the rest of their 15 signings have absolutely not gelled as a unit.\n\nCoach Ram Meher Singh has no idea about his best lineup, to say nothing about their defensive issues. They are the worst team in the league in most metrics, and are destined to finish last.",

    "publish_date": null,
    "authors": [],
    "raw_text": "This story appears in ESPN The Magazine's June 12 World Fame Issue. Subscribe today!\n\nA week before her husband dies, Lonnie Ali changes the plans for his funeral. The funeral she had envisioned is too big, she thinks. It is too complicated. At her annual meeting with the man who has been doing most of the planning, she says, \"Sit down. I have to talk to you about something.\"\n\nShe is making changes because she believes she has time to make them. Her husband is not even sick. And besides ... he's Muhammad Ali. She began working on the plan a decade earlier in response to counsel, and she's come to regard it as part of his routine upkeep, not so different from helping him with his meds. There are just some things you have to do, she says. She is not planning his funeral because she thinks he is going to die but because she has known him since she was a small child -- and a part of her thinks he is going to live forever.\n\nHer meeting with the man planning her husband's funeral, Bob Gunnell, takes place right before Memorial Day weekend in 2016. When he goes back to the office on Tuesday, May 31, he tells members of his staff that they're going to have to scrap a good part of the plan they've so painstakingly crafted. Then, after work, he gets a call from Lonnie. \"Bob,\" she says, \"I just want to make you aware that Muhammad has got a little cold. It's nothing to worry about, but as a precaution I'm going to take him to the hospital to get checked out.\"\n\nThe sound Muhammad Ali hears as he dies is the sound that babies hear right after they're born. It is just after 8:30 p.m. MT on June 3, 2016, a Friday. He is in Room 263, in the intensive care unit of the HonorHealth Scottsdale Osborn Medical Center, near his home in Paradise Valley, Arizona. He has been disconnected from the ventilator that has been keeping him strenuously alive, and the imam at his bedside has begun the call to prayer, as if ushering a newborn into the world.\n\nThe imam, whose name is Zaid Shakir, does not know why he has sung the familiar keening song; it is traditional to sing to those who are close to their first breath but not to those close to their last. But he has flown into Arizona from California, and he reached Ali's room not long before what he calls \"the paraphernalia of life support\" was removed. Lonnie Ali is there. Ali's nine children are there, along with many of his grandchildren, and after reciting supplications and reading from the Quran with them, Shakir suddenly finds himself in the grip of spontaneous necessity. He has been watching the pulse in Ali's neck, watching it surge with life after he started breathing on his own and then watching it slowly ebb, and now he leans over and with his mouth close to Ali's right ear, he sings, \"There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.\"\n\nShakir is tall and thin, nearly spindly, with a crooked smile and a beautiful voice, a voice that even when he's speaking carries a hint of a jazz, a way of hanging behind the beat before finding all the right notes. He does not whisper to Ali. He does not sing softly. He sings out loud, so that everyone can hear, so that the words will fill Ali's consciousness. Then he places in Ali's right hand a string of prayer beads offered by one of his grandsons and closes Ali's fingers around it. He begins talking to Ali, entreating him, exhorting him, telling him, \"Muhammad Ali, this is what it means, God is one; say it, repeat it, you've inspired so many, paradise is waiting -- \"\n\nWhen Shakir begins the call, Ali is alive. When he finishes, a doctor comes in and presses his stethoscope against Ali's chest; Shakir gently closes Ali's eyes. He lived for approximately 35 minutes after the disconnection of the ventilator, but now, at 9:10, Muhammad Ali, 74 years old, the three-time heavyweight champion of the world from Louisville, Kentucky, is pronounced dead, of septic shock.\n\nLonnie asks Imam Shakir to stay with her husband while the family files out of Room 263 and enters a new and diminished world -- the world without Muhammad Ali in it. He does for a while, but the room begins to give way to professionals. There are nurses and hospital staff. There are two funeral directors who were literally hidden in another room when Ali was dying and now emerge from the shadows. And there are three men who wear hastily packed suits and faces of seen-it-all vigilance but who have never seen what they're seeing now. Their names are Todd Kessinger, Brian Roggenkamp and Jon Lesher. They're off-duty homicide detectives from the Louisville Metro Police Department, and they flew to Phoenix the day before on a private jet to provide security for the Ali family. They're no strangers to death, horrible and unnatural. They've been around bodies in every possible condition. But the body in the bed is the body of Muhammad Ali. He is covered, at first; then, after the nurses have removed the tubes and disconnected the monitors that sustained him, uncovered. It is their job to secure the room against intrusion, and Ali against exploitation -- they've heard rumors that a tabloid television show is offering a $200,000 bounty for the first photos of The Greatest on his deathbed. But now they wonder how easily a photograph of the gaunt and balding man on the bed could be recognized. They feel tremendously solicitous toward him yet also somehow ennobled, as if they have come into the presence of a force larger and stronger than themselves. It is not fame, exactly; it is history, and Lesher keeps thinking that no matter what happens to him in the course of his life, no one will ever be able to take this moment away from him. So many people had encounters with Ali when he was alive: chance meetings that became, by the force of Ali's personality, indelibly personal, the stuff of stories told and retold. Lesher never did; neither did Kessinger or Roggenkamp. They encounter Ali dead, yet even with his life fled, his power persists, as if it's part of the atmosphere around his body. They are in the room with Muhammad Ali for 45 minutes. They have responsibility for Muhammad Ali for 45 minutes, until Roggenkamp departs to drive Lonnie Ali home. But there is a problem as they go to leave; Ali was not admitted as Muhammad Ali. He was admitted under an alias, confusing one of the funeral home directors. Finally, Kessinger says, \"Look, it's Muhammad Ali. Let's just go.\"\n\nWhen Lonnie goes home, she goes to a home absent of Ali. It is the singular advantage of living with an immobilized man -- he is always there. Now he is not. She was his caregiver even before she was his wife, and she has been his wife for 30 years. People mistakenly assume that she has prepared for this eventuality, this night; that she prepared to be his widow as soon as she married him. She did not. She is in shock. When she was -- when they were -- younger, she saw him snatch flies from the air. She saw him bleed from a cut one day and wake up the next morning with the cut nearly erased. She believed his blood was different from the blood of other humans. Even much later, when her husband was in exile from his body because of Parkinson's disease, he was not in exile from himself -- he was able to speak most mornings, and when he was finally silenced, he communicated through his touch and through the look in his eyes. He paid attention; he nodded; he squeezed her hand. And so now, in the degree of pain she experiences, she does not feel as though she's lost an old man with a terminal illness.\n\nShe feels as though she's lost a child.\n\nJeff Gardner wears a suit and tie for the embalming. It's a Saturday morning, and there is very little traffic, human or automotive, stirring the desert calm of Mesa, Arizona. It doesn't matter that no one is likely to see him. Over the past 30 years, Gardner has embalmed, by his estimate, some 5,000 bodies, and he has worn a suit and tie for all of them that have not presented a risk of infection. He is a stout man, fastidious, with a contemplative manner, a bass note in his voice and a taste for somber suits and splendid shoes. He wears the clothes he wears as a matter of reverence -- because, as he sometimes says, you never know when you'll go from looking at the body to meeting the family.\n\nGardner is Catholic; he is about to embalm a Muslim at the Bunker Family Funeral Home, which is owned by a family of Mormons; but his trade has a way of erasing distinctions. The day before, he flew in from Louisville, the only passenger on a private jet, carrying the case of embalming fluid that would allow Ali's body to be preserved in a way not forbidden to Muslims. Gardner had learned about this necessity about eight years earlier, when he and Woody Porter, his associate at the A.D. Porter and Sons Funeral Home, were summoned to meet with the Alis at their house in Louisville. It was the meeting that set Muhammad Ali on the course of which today represents the first fulfillment -- the planning of his own death and burial. Ali was in attendance; so was Lonnie; so were their lawyers and their accountant; and so were Zaid Shakir and Timothy Gianotti, an Islamic studies professor called in to advise the Alis. Ali was well into what Gianotti calls his \"purification,\" his humbling at the hands of Allah. But at the time, he still had his good days. And even at his sickest -- even at his last -- he never stopped knowing exactly who he was. He was, in Shakir's description, \"a praying man\" who understood he belonged to Allah. But he also knew he was Muhammad Ali, and so belonged to the world.\n\nIt is desirable for a Muslim to be buried within a day of dying rather than be embalmed. It is desirable for a Muslim to go straight into the ground rather than be casketed, so that the ground can have him. But Muhammad Ali wanted to be laid out in Yankee Stadium. He wanted an open casket, so the world could see he was still so pretty! He had dreams about them -- the crowds. So he sought compromise. According to Shakir and Gianotti, embalming is not strictly forbidden; an embalming solution containing alcohol or formaldehyde is. Not only are those elements poison, but they are the manifestation of a desire to attain immortality of the body rather than the soul. The body should rot, at the bottom of a hole in the ground, while the soul goes on to paradise.\n\nGardner invested in a case of \"green\" embalming fluid that contained no substance offensive to God. For the next eight years, he wore a dedicated pager as dutifully as he wore his jackets, his ties and his alligator shoes ... and now that he has gotten the call, he is ready to embalm Muhammad Ali, who came from the hospital last night and this morning is laid out in the basement of the Bunker Funeral Home. It is the most extraordinary circumstance of Gardner's earthly existence, but the job he has to do is anything but extraordinary; he has done it thousands of times. He embalmed his mother; he embalmed his father; now his touch falls upon a man who has touched so many, and whose message went around the world. It is an honor and privilege for Jeff Gardner to have been chosen to serve Muhammad Ali. Yet he has no choice but to start the way he always has, the way he was taught: He thinks. He breathes. He goes to work.\n\nAfter Ahmad Ewais eats breakfast with his family, he drives to the Bunker Funeral Home. He is calm. He wears what he usually wears, a polo shirt and khakis. He is a tall man in his mid-40s, with close-cropped hair and a salt-and-pepper beard, and it is impossible to meet him without looking at his hands. They are large and very clean. They are never balled in fists; he holds them as if he were holding a large bowl, and they shape themselves into imploring gestures when Ewais, as is his habit, turns his eyes toward heaven. He is a devout man who has turned his simplest movements into prayers. His fingernails are the color of pearls.\n\nWhen Ewais gets to the funeral home, Jeff Gardner is waiting for him. Gardner has finished his work, but he wants to make sure Ewais has the linen wrappings he brought with him on the private jet from Louisville -- the linen Ali bought for himself years ago. Ewais has brought linen of his own, some of it cut into long strips he uses for tying. He has brought two plastic pitchers, one of them red and the other purple. He has brought a bottle of liquid Dial soap. He has brought towels he bought at Costco. He has brought a mask and gloves and cotton, in case he needs them. He has brought sticks of incense. From Saudi Arabia he has brought water said to be from the spring that bubbled up under the son of Abraham, and a bagful of lotus leaves. He has brought several kinds of perfume. He has brought camphor, which he ground himself in a coffee mill. He has also brought a friend from his mosque in Tempe, who will assist him, along with Zaid Shakir and Timothy Gianotti when they arrive. At approximately 10 o'clock, they do, and Gardner leads them into the room where Ali lies under a sheet. He watches for a while, until Ewais starts washing the body.\n\nAhmad Ewais is a body washer. He has washed nearly 1,000. It is his vocation, and it has seeped into him, all the way to his fingertips. He believes it is a mercy, and therefore an obligation. He believes that for every body he washes, 40 of his sins are forgiven. He believes that Allah commands the faithful to help the helpless, and he knows from experience that there is nothing in creation as helpless as a dead body, even when the body belongs to Muhammad Ali.\n\nEwais lights a stick of incense. With soap and water, he washes Ali's hands and arms up to the elbow, as if Ali were alive, preparing for prayer. Then he cleans Ali's privates, sliding his hands under a towel. At no time is Ali uncovered or exposed; the towel extends from his belly to his knees, and Ewais lifts it with his left hand and washes with his right, pouring water from the plastic pitchers. It is quiet in the room, Shakir and Gianotti helping turn the body when Ewais asks them to, and the quiet is sacramental. They are transfixed, watching Ewais -- how much care he takes, how unhurried are his movements and how certain his hands -- and Shakir thinks to himself that Muhammad Ali is being washed by the Muhammad Ali of body washers. But Ewais is transfixed by Ali himself. It is not that the great champion is more than a man; it is that he is precisely a man, and so has wound up here, on the table with him.\n\n\u0093Muhammad Ali, no matter what you do in life, this is the final destination! You were The Greatest -- may God make you The Purest!\u0094\n\n- Ahmad Ewais\n\nHe washes him three times, as tradition prescribes, the first time with soap; the second time with the ground lotus leaves, which foam like soap when he adds water; and the third time with camphor and perfume. He covers him with three sheets, stretching from his shoulders to his knees, from his waist to his feet, and then from head to toe. But he also talks to him, and prays for him, thinking the thoughts instead of speaking the words. \"Here you are, Muhammad Ali, no matter what you do in life, this is the final destination! You were The Greatest -- may God make you The Purest!\" As a Muslim, he believes that when humans die, their souls leave their bodies but linger, unable to respond but hearing and seeing and feeling, until their bodies are put to rest. Ewais is working to bring Ali's soul back to God. It takes him 45 minutes, maybe an hour, to finish, to reach the point where he is tying Ali's wrappings up with the long strips of linen. He is about to apply perfume to Ali's face when he calls Shakir and Gianotti over to look. Ali is wearing a linen turban; his face is all that shows, and Shakir and Gianotti are both struck by how regal he looks, like an African king. But there is something else: He gleams. All through the course of his life, people asked if they could touch his face, because it was so smooth and so unmarked and so shiny. Now some of that luster has been restored, and the man who washes him says to his assistants, \"Look -- his face is as bright as the moon.\"\n\nLate that night, Timothy Gianotti goes for a walk to contemplate what he has seen. He remembers when he first met Ali, years before -- how shorn he was of all that made him great, yet how great he still was. He lacked physical power, yet it was as though Gianotti had encountered a purified soul sitting in a chair. Now he has seen Ali in death, laid out on a table. Here was a man who never declined God's call. Called upon to fight, he poured his genius into fighting, and once or twice fought nearly to the death. Called upon to make peace, he made peace at the cost of his athletic prime. Called upon by crowds of people all over the world, he gave himself to them, and moved among them. Called upon to endure the mortification of his body, he surrendered without sacrificing his spirit. He never complained, never lost his faith, and this morning, there it was, returned to him: the shine on his face.\n\nGianotti has lost track of time and place, and goes outside to regain his sense of purchase under the desert sky. It is Saturday night, June 4. In the morning, he will get on the plane that is taking Ali back to Louisville. But right now he is walking around the Arizona resort where he is staying. This is reality enough. A woman approaches. She is African-American. He has never seen her before, but she knows him. She says, \"You're here for Muhammad Ali.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"You know,\" she says, \"he belonged to us.\"\n\nThere is nobody watching. There is nobody cheering. There are no crowds. It is early on Sunday morning, and three vehicles are making their way to the airport. One is a white hearse containing a travel casket draped with a funeral cloth provided by Zaid Shakir, black and stitched in gold with Islamic verses. The two others are a police car and a black SUV. The vehicle at the front of the procession carries a detail from the local police; the one in the rear carries the three homicide detectives from Louisville. It is so quiet that the men who make up this cortege of strangers share a sense of disbelief -- surely they will be discovered, set upon. They are not. They make it to the airport, where a chartered jet is waiting. They drive right on the tarmac, right up to the cargo hold. A few of Ali's friends are on hand to help the undertakers, the police and the flight crew load the sheathed casket on the plane; they put their hands on it, on him, then go up the stairs to join the living. The police car, the SUV and the hearse begin to leave; the plane prepares for takeoff. But as it does, the driver of the hearse sees a squabble of television trucks speeding onto the tarmac. They come to a stop at the same time their quarry lifts into the sky.\n\nThe plane is a 737 leased from the San Francisco Giants. It is the large plane the man in the hold wanted it to be. There are not quite 30 passengers. Although they are scattered around the cabin, they all have something in common. It is no accident that they are together; it is no surprise that they are here. To the extent that they know one another, they know one another because for years they were bound to the same secret: Long before Muhammad Ali died, they were chosen to lay him to rest.\n\nLonnie sits in the front of the plane with his children and grandchildren, many of them wearing shirts proclaiming her husband \"The Greatest of All Time.\" Some of the family is not on the charter, and when Lonnie tried to make plane and hotel reservations for them while she was still in Arizona, she received the first inkling that the size and scope of the funeral might exceed her expectations: \"What is going on in Louisville?\" the travel agent said. \"Why is it so difficult to find flights into Louisville?\"\n\n\"Well, my husband died,\" Lonnie said.\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" the travel agent said, as though Lonnie had spoken a non sequitur. \"Yeah, but what is going on there?\"\n\nLonnie never informed the agent that her husband happened to be Muhammad Ali. But that's Lonnie. Though her face is gaunt with strain and she walks with a slight limp, she still has the freckles and talent for rolling her eyes that identify her for what she was, is and always will be: Yolanda Williams, the girl from the neighborhood. She was 6 years old when she met Cassius Clay; he was 21, and about to become the heavyweight champion of the world. She lived across the street from his parents; his mother and her mother were friends. She is living proof of how important Louisville remained to him, because one of the many things she wound up doing for him was keeping Louisville in his life. When Lonnie calls herself a \"Louisville girl,\" she means that she is at once a Southern girl and a Catholic-school girl, not to mention a girl Ali recognized early on for having good sense. She refers to herself as \"ol' Lonnie\"; she insists she and Ali were nothing more and nothing less than normal people, despite her husband being the most famous man in the world. Her father had polio, so even Ali's Parkinson's disease seemed normal to her. From personal experience, she knew he belonged to anyone who asked for his autograph, but it was hard to fathom he belonged to everyone. And when he spoke of holding his memorial service in an arena or a stadium, she'd say, \"Yeah, right, Muhammad.\" This is not to say she isn't consumed by a sense of mission as she sits on the plane. She is, but it's the mission of a Louisville girl who wants to take Muhammad Ali home.\n\nIn the Quran, it is written that all is written -- \"nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us.\" And so it is with Ali, in the most literal sense. There is a book, called The Book, that is the chronicle of his death, foretold. It is a compilation of sorts, drawing upon the expertise of lawyers, cops, clerics, masters of the mortuary arts. It was written by Bob Gunnell. Eight years ago, when the Alis were looking for someone to plan Muhammad's funeral, they chose Gunnell, a Louisville public relations man who would later start his own firm, BoxcarPR, and who had no experience in event planning. They were comfortable with the Louisville guy, though in fact Gunnell began as a country boy from Eminence, Kentucky. He found out what kind of stage he was about to occupy when he was watching Michael Jackson's funeral in 2009. Lonnie called and said, \"Bob, I don't want the funeral to be like this. We want it to be in the Muslim tradition. It needs to be carried out to Muhammad's wishes, to the T.\"\n\nGunnell and his associate at Boxcar, Danielle Rudy Davis, completed three drafts of The Book before submitting it for approval, and when they did, Ali reviewed and initialed each page. There were 169 of them. In addition, there was a sheaf of nondisclosure agreements, several of which have been signed by passengers on the flight from Phoenix to Louisville. Jeff Gardner, in his suit and tie; Todd Kessinger and his crew, in their dress blues; Zaid Shakir and Timothy Gianotti; Gunnell himself: They were all bound to secrecy, and The Book is called The Book because under no circumstance is there to exist -- and be available to prying eyes -- a document titled \"The Funeral of Muhammad Ali.\"\n\nAnd yet who knows what God's own book looks like, how many second thoughts and scratch-outs complicate its pages? The Book might be stored in Boxcar's safe, but it is always and forever subject to revision. Five days before Ali was admitted to Scottsdale Osborn, Gunnell had the meeting with Lonnie, and he had to halve his estimate of the crowd. Yesterday, not long after Ali's body was purified by Ahmad Ewais, Gunnell met Lonnie in the shoe section of Nordstrom, and they came to what seemed a final plan for the week to come. And yet ... who knows what awaits them in Louisville? The Book, in its present iteration, is based on an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 people attending Ali's memorial. But Gunnell, here on the plane, in one of the suits he bought at Nordstrom, can't help but be haunted by a conversation he'd had with Matt Lauer the day Ali died. Lauer had been the first newsman to know that death was imminent, and in one of their conversations, Gunnell had asked how big he thought the funeral was going to be. Lauer's answer: \"Think Nelson Mandela.\"\n\n\"We have to have an emergency meeting,\" Shakir says to Gunnell. They are still in the air. It's a three-hour flight, and there is still time before they touch ground. Yet there is a sense of urgency. It is Sunday; when the plane lands, the death of Muhammad Ali, still a private event, becomes a public one. Gunnell has already directed the Boxcar staff to clear hotels and event halls all over Louisville, and Boxcar and Lonnie have been overwhelmed by the inquiries they've received from celebrities and world leaders. One of them has been from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who wants to join the ranks of eulogists at Ali's public memorial service.\n\nAli selected his eulogists long ago, and Erdogan was not among them. But when Lonnie suggests maybe he should be able to pray or read from the Quran at the Islamic prayer service known as the jenazah, Gunnell reminds her the jenazah, at least as envisioned in The Book, is supposed to be a small and private affair, open only to family and friends. So the question is not how big the funeral is going to be, nor how many famous people can be accommodated, but to whom does Muhammad Ali belong?\n\nHe had that kind of soul, the kind people claim for themselves, so burying him requires sorting through any number of constituencies. He was a husband and a father. He was a citizen of Louisville; he was a citizen of the world. He was a proud black man who held the truth of his own beauty self-evident; he was offered -- especially in his later years when he had been made safe by silence -- as the embodiment of post-racial possibility. He became a global figure not when he became heavyweight champion of the world but when he changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, exchanging the name of a proud young man for a name that made his people proud. He was a Muslim, devout and conservative, and he was a celebrity who tended to speak of himself in superlatives. He never stopped calling himself The Greatest and he never stopped saying God is great, and he somehow reconciled those assertions.\n\n\u0093You can all sit down. Muhammad goes first.\u0094\n\n- Lonnie Ali\n\nIt is easy to say that Ali belongs to everyone. It might even be true. But on the plane, Shakir sits with Lonnie Ali and Bob Gunnell and says that he belongs to the people who need him, and the people who need him are Muslims and African-Americans. He belongs to Allah, yes, but he belongs to Allah because he belongs to the people. If you deny the people the chance to pray for him -- well, it will do damage not only to them but to him. He is not just here to be celebrated; he is crossing over, and so he is here to be ferried, by many hands. Allah needs his soul; therefore the people need his body, to pray for his soul's release.\n\nThe plane flies into Louisville, and when it lands, and the passengers begin their restless stirring, Lonnie stands up. She is a soft-spoken woman but also a plainspoken one, and now she makes an announcement that sounds like a statement of general principle: \"You can all sit down. Muhammad goes first.\"\n\nIt is a windy day in Louisville, and the wind keeps peeling the black and gold funeral cloth off the casket as it is unloaded from the cargo hold of the plane and loaded in the back of a black hearse. The mayor, Greg Fischer, is waiting in Louisville, along with a crescent-shaped formation of eight black SUVs, containing a full security contingent run by Kelly Jones, the head of special ops for the Louisville Metro Police. There are helicopters in Louisville, taking soundless footage, and there are jangled nerves in Louisville, and on the way to the funeral home, Jones sees people in cars pulling out their phones and taking photographs, so he orders the procession to start running lights.\n\nWoody Porter is waiting for Lonnie at the second of the A.D. Porter Funeral Home locations, away from downtown. Porter is the scion of four generations of African-American funeral directors. He is bald-headed and dapper, and though he is hobbled by diabetes and knows how to lower his voice in reverence when called upon to do so, he is a beaming presence with a wheezy laugh -- an ebullient undertaker. He buried both of Muhammad's parents and Lonnie's mother, and when Ali used the visitation of Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. as an opportunity to hand out Islamic literature at the head of the casket, Porter knew Ali well enough to say, \"Ali, sit down. You don't have to stand during your father's visitation.\" Lonnie trusts him because he is family and can make her laugh.\n\nEight years earlier, he went with Jeff Gardner to Ali's Louisville home for a preliminary meeting about Ali's funeral. When Zaid Shakir and Timothy Gianotti explained to him that Ali, as an observant Muslim, should be buried in as plain a casket as possible, Porter turned to Ali and said, \"Ali, what do you want -- metal or wood?\" Ali answered, \"Wood.\" Porter stayed on Lonnie for a long time to go ahead and buy the casket, and when she did, it stayed at A.D. Porter for nearly four years. Now, as he waits for Lonnie, the casket waits for Ali.\n\nThe casket is not overly embellished, in accordance with the Alis' wishes. But neither is it a pine box; neither is it anything less than what Porter calls \"one beautiful piece of furniture.\" He had to order a custom casket, given Ali's size -- or, in Porter's words, his length. It is made of African mahogany, each plank 4 to 6 inches thick, so that the entire wooden box weighs 700 pounds, empty.\n\nAfter Ali arrives at A.D. Porter Southeast, Porter helps move his body from the shipping casket to the casket he has prepared for him. So do Jeff Gardner, Zaid Shakir, Timothy Gianotti and Ali's youngest son, Asaad. Porter sees Ali's face and thinks, \"He looks good. Ali looks good!\" When Lonnie and Asaad are about to have their own private visitation with him, Lonnie's first quiet time with her husband since his death, Porter asks her whether she wants to see him. Gardner opens the casket for her, and she beholds her husband's face. He was always so careful about his face, and now, yes, it shines. But she can't bring herself to call it beautiful, because it is shadowed by the fact that she will never see it again.\n\nWhen Todd Kessinger returns to work on Monday, he checks to see what has happened in his absence. As the detective in charge of the homicide department, he has been busy because Louisville has been bloody; indeed, the city in 2016 is in the middle of a record run of murders. But the last killing had occurred on June 2, when a 21-year-old named Maulik Patel was shot on his way home from a gas station. There has not been another since Ali died, and Kessinger begins to count the days of grace.\n\nAt 9:04, the sun sets and Ramadan begins.\n\nThe champ had a persistent dream -- he is running on Broadway in downtown Louisville, and all of the city has turned out for him, chanting a name meant to be chanted, \"Ali! Ali! Ali!\" until at last the chant gives him wings, and he takes a step into the air and begins to fly. But Broadway, in downtown Louisville, does not end in sky; it ends in Cave Hill Cemetery, where he will be buried.\n\nCave Hill is an elaborate historical cemetery, a rolling and well-tended garden the first graves of which were dug in 1848 and out of which grow the granite monuments of the families who made their names during Louisville's industrial heyday. It is white, in terms of the impression left by its pale stone flora, and also white in terms of its venerable clientele -- as white, indeed, as the suit coat of one of its most famous inhabitants, Colonel Sanders. It is home to 6,100 Union soldiers and 228 Confederate ones, all interred under the flags of their respective nations. It is heartbreakingly beautiful and beautifully heartbreaking, a dream not of eternal life but rather of eternal status, and eight years before Ali's death, Lonnie visited with Woody Porter and bought a 12-grave lot in Section U, on a hill positioned between the maintenance shed and the pond set aside for the scattering of ashen remains. While it might be tempting to ascribe symbolic significance to the Alis' deciding to settle forever among those whose homes their ancestors could only have visited by way of the back door, Lonnie, forever of Louisville, keeps it simple: \"It was either Cave Hill or Mecca.\"\n\nNow, on Tuesday, Lonnie returns with a contingent of advisers, not only Woody Porter but also Bob Gunnell, Jeff Gardner, Zaid Shakir and Timothy Gianotti. A funeral tent stands upon the real estate the Alis have already purchased, but Lonnie has come to entertain an offer: Would she like to move? She meets with Gwen Mooney, a friendly and forthcoming woman who gives off the impression that she is continually pinching herself out of disbelief that she runs a place as charming as Cave Hill. Mooney says she is simply making sure there is no room for regret, but at the same time she frets that the lot Lonnie has selected is not the most desirable one available -- and so she offers her a lot near Cave Hill's Broadway gate, off one of the circular avenues that have traditionally provided the cemetery's most prestigious addresses. Shaded with old trees, it is, Mooney says, sacred ground, a place untouched by backhoe or spade -- until now. No burials have occurred here; no burials have been allowed here, but for Ali, Cave Hill is willing not only to make an exception but to make an exception that will cost no more than Section U.\n\nLonnie says no -- no, no, as briskly as that. It is not simply that she prefers the seclusion of the lot she has already purchased, or that Zaid Shakir is on hand to tell her that the prescribed orientation of Ali's body, with his feet to the north and his head to the south, is more easily attained on the little hill by the scattering pond. It is that Ali needs to go where Ali died believing he was going to go. Her plans are his plans; years ago, he came here with Lonnie, staying in the car as she showed him the lot, and the lot is where she will come for peace, if peace ever comes.\n\nThey go from Cave Hill to the Kentucky Fairgrounds, where the jenazah is to be held Thursday -- the jenazah, the prayer service now with a life of its own, having gone from something unplanned to something aswirl with unreconciled energies. The body will be there. In a closed coffin, under the black and gold cloth ... but the body will be there, it has to be there, in a room among the faithful, all of whom will have unrestricted access. At the fairgrounds, there is an arena called Freedom Hall, where the Louisville Cardinals used to play basketball and where Cassius Clay had his first professional fight. It is the venue Lonnie's security consultants have suggested, because they can control the access points. But for Zaid Shakir it is still not big enough for Ali -- and so fairgrounds officials show him the commercial exhibition hall next door. It is vast and it is the color of linen, with high ceilings held up by graceful columns, and as soon as Shakir sees it he thinks:\n\nThis looks like a mosque.\n\nThey don't sleep. Nobody does -- Bob Gunnell and his staff have set up a \"war room\" in the Marriott in downtown Louisville, where the people never stop calling and the phones never stop ringing and the adrenaline never stops surging. They don't sleep because they can't sleep, and no matter when Gunnell finally collapses into his hotel-room bed, he starts his day by checking in with Lonnie at sunrise.\n\nOn most days, they face the dawn before Louisville does. On Wednesday, however, Gunnell texts Lonnie at 6 a.m. with news of something that started happening in the smallest hours of the morning. They'd gone to sleep expecting the KFC Yum Center, the big downtown arena, to start distributing tickets at 10 for the Friday memorial service. The tickets are free, but anybody who wants them has to get in line and pick them up in person. Now Gunnell wakes up to the news that there is a line at the Yum Center -- a line that started forming at 4 in the morning; a line that extends over the Clark Memorial Bridge on 2nd Avenue, all the way to Indiana; a line that is forcing Mayor Fischer to open the Yum Center's ticket windows immediately. Gunnell sends Lonnie a text, and she answers: Did I read this right? He calls her back. Yes, he says. All the way to Indiana.\n\nThe windows open, and in about 45 minutes 15,000 tickets are gone. And Lonnie has to smile because it has such an Ali-esque ring to it. Even when I died, the people lined up all the way to Indiana. She is not happy; happy is not the word for what she is feeling, and won't be for a long time. But something is going on, a fulfillment of what she thought was fantasy. Muhammad had told her the truth. The man who dreamed of crowds knew they were coming for him, and now here they came.\n\nMore Stores About Ali\n\nOutside The Lines Ali's funeral was fitting for his greatness\n\nAn Appreciation 'The Greatest,' in and out of the ring\n\nThe Undefeated In the end, and always, the 'People's Champ'\n\nFeatured Ali Podcasts\n\nAll Day with Clinton Yates Tom Junod tells Clinton what Ali meant to him.\n\nThe Rhoden Fellows Bill Rhoden and three of the Rhoden Fellows interview Tom Junod on how he reported this story.\n\nA plane comes out of the sky. It is early Wednesday morning, 2:30 or thereabouts, but a motorcade occupies the ramp, waiting for the plane to land. It is a large motorcade, indeed a presidential one, comprising about 50 cars, engines running, lights throwing spinning shadows. When the plane lands, a trim figure in a suit descends the air stairs, then steps onto a red carpet that's been rolled out for him. He is not a large man, but he has a certain coiled swagger, as though a red carpet stretches before him no matter where he goes. He also has his own armed security force, men with a coiled swagger all their own.\n\nBarack Obama will not be attending Ali's funeral because, now in the last year of his presidency, he is going to his older daughter's high school graduation. But Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey, has come to Louisville bearing gifts. He has brought a piece of fabric said to be from the Kaaba, the cubelike shrine at the center of Mecca, and therefore at the very heart of Islam. He wants to drape it over Ali's casket at Thursday's jenazah. He is not so different from the multitudes who have made pilgrimages to Ali's funeral. He wants to bring something of himself to Ali; he wants to establish his connection to Ali; he wants to celebrate Ali, and therefore celebrate himself and his people. On the other hand, he is Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a powerful man for whom the funeral represents not just an occasion but an opportunity. He is, his representatives insist, the leader of the Islamic world. And he wants a platform at the jenazah commensurate with his exalted position.\n\nSeven years earlier, Lonnie Ali saw the funeral of Michael Jackson and knew she didn't want her husband's funeral to be like that -- a funeral in which the mourners seemed to have an individual stake. She envisioned something very different, a funeral in the spirit of Muhammad Ali and for the spirit of Muhammad Ali, in which believers gather only to pray the fallen hero to paradise. In that way, the funeral would be similar in spirit to the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca required of all observant Muslims. There would be no distinctions made between rich and poor or black and white, nor would there be special accommodations made for the exercise of political power, since all are equal in the eyes of God.\n\nAnd so it is that by the time the sun rises on Thursday, the atmosphere of the North Wing of the Exhibition Hall at the Kentucky Exposition Center is already charged with a mixture of devotion and conflict. The security teams assigned to the jenazah from the U.S. Secret Service and the Louisville Metro Police don't like the hall, for precisely the same reasons that Zaid Shakir and Timothy Gianotti do -- because it is vast, and flat, with no \"advantage points\" should the presence of Muhammad Ali's body inspire a free-for-all. The believers begin arriving when the officers do, forming a line at 6 in the morning, and by the time Zaid Shakir begins the jenazah six hours later, standing next to the casket in which lies the body of Muhammad Ali, there are thousands on hand to join him in prayer. They are black and they are white; they are Muslim and they are non-Muslim; they are members of Ali's family and they are members of the family of the famous; and they have made the Kentucky Exposition Center into an impromptu temple when the president of Turkey arrives with his security team.\n\nErdogan has indeed come with his gift, the piece of cloth from the sacred Kaaba. But the gift has been refused because it came with conditions, and the men around him are determined to see those conditions met. They form a phalanx around their president, and they begin elbowing and muscling their way to the body of Muhammad Ali. They are invited to sit in the VIP section, with the American politicians and sports figures, but no, they seek a position not only of prominence but of proximity so they can grace Ali's casket with the cloth from the Kaaba. The standing room-only crowd responds to the jostling as crowds do, with an electric sense of unease; the Louisville police officer who has been standing alone in front of the casket is joined by seven of his colleagues, who form a line of their own. The two phalanxes meet; there is talk of the body being evacuated; and then Timothy Gianotti steps forward, to remind Erdogan's men of the spirit of the hajj. It is a moment of uncertainty that turns out to be a moment of truth, for Erdogan withdraws. He leaves the hall; he leaves Louisville; and the plane on which he came returns to the sky.\n\nThat night, visitors come to Porter's, one after another. Ali is in a closed casket set in a private room, and they each receive a prescribed amount of time to visit with him. Louis Farrakhan goes first, with representatives from the Nation of Islam; they get half an hour. Next come the children, for an hour. Then comes Rahman Ali, in the grip of the same disease that shackled his brother. When he was a young man, he had a sharply chiseled face; now it is wide, almost burgeoning, like Muhammad's. He has an hour at Porter's, but he is a man inclined to show up and to leave unexpectedly, and he doesn't take all of the allotted time. Ali is alone as the funeral home clears out; then four men open the casket and take a last look. It is not out of love, or the impulse that takes over in mythology, when mortals make the mistake of sneaking one final glimpse at the gods. It is a matter of duty. They have to turn his body so that when he's in the ground at Cave Hill, feet to the north and head to the south, he's lying on his right side, with his face facing east. Woody Porter, Jeff Gardner, Zaid Shakir and Timothy Gianotti: They all have a hand in it; they all turn him and rig the casket so he stays turned. And they see him. He had an unusual face for a man universally considered handsome -- it was round and soft, lacking in sharp edges and more notable for its skin than its bones. He rarely called himself handsome; he called himself pretty, and he was right. \"I'm a bad man,\" he said, yet he never gave up the face of a beloved child until his face gave up on him. It is the pampered softness that left him, and as he lies in his casket, it's been replaced by a turbaned hauteur and that ineradicable shine. When the four men finish their work, they become the last men on earth to see his face; and when they close the lid, they know that no human being will see Muhammad Ali again.\n\nThere is a prayer service Friday morning, led by Zaid Shakir, and then the pallbearers take the casket to the shiny black hearse. There are 10 of them, because of the mass of what they're carrying, and they all have one thing in common: They've been chosen. Some are relatives, mostly from the Clay side; some are famous, Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis and Will Smith; and one has been chosen to be a pallbearer because Ali chose him to be his friend. John Ramsey was just a fan when he met Ali; a worshipful young man in his 20s goaded by friends to approach Ali at a party. He went with his Howard Cosell impression, to which Ali responded: \"Howard Cosell gets paid for that. What's your excuse?\" Later, he looked at Ramsey and said: \"I like you. Write down your number. I'll come see you some time.\" Two weeks later, Ramsey's mother told him to get the door, and it was Ali. They'd been friends ever since, and Ramsey, who has a sports talk show on Louisville radio and has never quite been able to extinguish the light of worship in his face, has always wondered why. He traveled with Ali; he gave Ali his meds and buttoned his shirts; and seeing how Ali acted with other people -- and the people to whom he gave his attention -- has led him to one conclusion: Ali chose Ramsey to be his friend because Ali saw that Ramsey needed to be his friend. Ali responded to the need in people and people responded to the need in Ali, and what Ramsey can't help thinking as he meets Mike Tyson in the morning, and sits in a car in the funeral procession in the unlikely company of Lennox Lewis and Will Smith, is that they must have needed him too.\n\nThere are 17 vehicles in the procession. The hearse is three vehicles from the lead; Lonnie's SUV is three from the hearse, behind the imams and the pallbearers. She is in the first family car, with Asaad, her sister Marilyn and her nephew. And so others in the procession see them before she does: the people. It is not merely a crowd lined up along Bardstown Road; it is her husband's dream of crowds. Not dozens, not hundreds, but thousands upon thousands, giving voice to billions, in an incessant cheer that echoes over the miles. Ali! Ali! Ali!\n\nAt first Yolanda Williams thinks it will go away -- that they will go away -- when they get past the exit of A.D. Porter, and then again when they leave Bardstown Road and get on the highway. But the chant keeps getting louder, the crowd keeps growing thicker, until Lonnie Ali at last surrenders, to them, to him and to their need for one another.\n\nThe route to Cave Hill is 23 miles long, and the procession takes two hours to complete it. They go on the highway, they stop in front of the Muhammad Ali Center, they loop through downtown Louisville on Muhammad Ali Boulevard, and then they head west, to the home where he grew up. He never stopped visiting the old street. He used to ask Ramsey to drive there, and when he saw men hanging around on the corner, he'd roll down his window and say, \"I'll still whip all you n-----s.\" They'd stop and do a double take, then cry, \"Ali!\" They are all here now, all the men from the neighborhood, all the women and the children, all the babies, all of black Louisville celebrating his return and laying their final claim on him. Lonnie had asked Kelly Jones and security consultant Jim Cain whether the procession could stop in front of his old house, painted pink; they said yes, for 15 seconds, fearing that they would be overwhelmed. But now they have to stop. They have no choice. When they make the left onto Grand Avenue, they are enveloped not by a crowd but by a populace, not by people but by a people, and they feel the tug of humanity itself, this warring entity made up of hands, tears, laughter, dancing, music, signs, babies, wheelchairs, voices raised in a two-syllable chant, an articulated roar: AH-LEEEEEE. Lonnie rolls down her window. Even Will Smith rolls down his window, saying, \"Muhammad wouldn't want us to be in a bubble!\" More hands, outstretched, imploring; and now kisses.\n\nAnd then tears. They all cry, even the hard ones, especially the hard ones, Bob Gunnell, Mike Tyson and, yes, Lonnie, crying for him, crying for them, crying for the crowd touching their cars and piling roses on Ali's hearse, but also crying for themselves, the certain knowledge that for as long as they live they will never live through something like this again, nor feel quite so alive. The procession starts moving again, the police officer who stood alone in front of Ali's casket at the jenazah now at the front, in a \"piercing\" car that parts the waters and allows Ali passage home, down Broadway, where this man who dreamed of crowds also dreamed of flight.\n\nMaggie Cassaro's mother died unexpectedly the previous September. Grief-stricken, the artist wanted to do something special for her, so she collected roses and scattered their petals over the entrance of her house. The sidewalk, the path to the porch, the porch itself: all graced by a gust of roses. When Ali died, Cassaro called Cave Hill to ask permission to dress its venerable gates. The office told her to call Boxcar. She did, and the Boxcar folks called Lonnie. They'd heard dozens of similar offers and requests from people wanting to participate in some way in Ali's funeral. Maggie Cassaro's was the only one Lonnie accepted, the only one that made her cry.\n\nAn average rose has 44 petals. With the help of the old-line Louisville florist Nanz & Kraft, Cassaro bagged some 88,000 of them. Now, as the procession makes its way toward Cave Hill, Cassaro is one of the multitudes at the gates, tending to a drift of red and pink snowflakes on a 90-degree day in June. There are roses everywhere in Louisville, roses in the streets, roses on Ali's hearse, roses still in people's hands. But Cave Hill was swept by bomb-sniffing dogs at 6 in the morning. All of its employees are employed on this day, many of them posted at the perimeter to make sure nobody gets over the cemetery walls. It is shut down and sealed tight, and as Ali enters a place he will never leave, the petals piled at the gate linger like Louisville's last kiss.\n\nThey dug the hole the day before. It is usually a job for four, but this time it was a job for all of the men in Cave Hill's excavation crew so all eight could one day tell their children they dug Muhammad Ali's grave. They cut the hole with a sod knife and dug it out with a backhoe, one man after another working the controls. They gave way to a two-man team from a local manufacturer of funeral vaults, who brought Ali's vault to the cemetery on the back of a flatbed truck, then lowered it into the ground with a winch. It was -- is -- a basic vault, black with silver highlights, set in a hole 63 inches deep and 36 inches wide, from which has been displaced a hillock of earth and to which a hillock of earth is waiting patiently to return.\n\nIt is easy to get lost at Cave Hill Cemetery, with its 16 miles of coiled roads, so as soon as the gates are closed, Gwen Mooney goes to the head of the funeral procession. She knows the way to Section U. Not only has the procession been returned to a world of quiet and privacy, but the mourners have been introduced to their own fatigue. In their black sunglasses and black clothes, they emerge from their cars into the sun and listen to Zaid Shakir say prayers at the graveside. Up on the hill, the excavation crew and the two men from the vault manufacturer stand ready to go to work, close enough to see but too far away to listen, until they are summoned to the burial. At many funerals, the family leaves before the casket is lowered into the ground, the vault sealed and the hole filled back up with dirt. At Ali's funeral, however, the family is determined to see the whole thing through because of what it owes Allah and because of what it owes Muhammad Ali. The family members cannot bear to leave him to unseen mercies, so they witness the Cave Hill crew lower him into the grave, then a man named Ricky Barnett use a small crane to seal the vault with a 1,000-pound concrete lid swinging from short chains. The lid makes the vault airtight and virtually waterproof, transforming it into an underground tomb that exists in contradiction of God's will. But God is merciful, as long as his mercy is not flaunted, and now Zaid Shakir picks up a handful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket of Muhammad Ali. It makes a thumping, rattling sound.\n\n\"From this earth we have created you,\" Shakir says.\n\nThe second handful:\n\n\"To this earth we return you.\"\n\nAnd then the third:\n\n\"From this earth we will resurrect you.\"\n\nAs Muhammad Ali died, Shakir told him what to say to God. He does the same now that Ali's body has been laid to rest and his soul has been released to face the questioning of angels. He addresses him directly: \"Muhammad Ali, say Allah is Lord ...\" But now there is work to be done, and he is not alone. He watches Mike Tyson take off his suit jacket and grab one of three gleaming new stainless steel shovels that Cave Hill has provided for the occasion. Tyson digs, hard, and then turns one shovelful of dirt into the grave, and then another. His contribution is not ceremonial; he does not hand over the shovel; he begins to sweat, and then Shakir hears that sound, the unmistakable uuungh of Mike Tyson getting to work. He thinks, I have to keep up with Mike Tyson ... but that's what they all think as they grab shovels and sweat through their clothes in the heat and keep working until the vault is covered and all that is to be seen of Muhammad Ali is a layer of Louisville earth, even though they still smell roses.\n\nThen they go. Fifteen thousand ticket holders are waiting for them at the Yum Center, along with Bill Clinton and the other eulogists; the famous friends; the honored guests; the convocation of all-timers hanging out in the University of Louisville locker room pressed into service as a greenroom. Kareem and Beckham, Jim Brown, George Foreman and Sugar Ray Leonard ... But as the mourners leave the mortal remains of Muhammad Ali to the backhoe and the shovels, three men in suits and ties stay behind until the work is done. Todd Kessinger, Brian Roggenkamp and Jon Lesher. A week ago, they were the only ones left in the hospital room after Muhammad Ali died. Now they're the only ones left at his grave. It has been an easy week for them in many ways; no one has been killed since June 2. But the next morning, Kessinger will go back to work and find that he has to investigate the murder of a woman named Jacoya Mangrum, killed at 4 in the morning on June 11, 2016, in a world without Ali.\n\nIt is tempting, when paying a visit, to believe that Ali has been set free -- to believe that he exists in the beauty of the setting, in the sun in the sky and the wind in the magnolia tree that overhangs his grave, instead of in the ground. But he has been there a year now. He is at the bottom of a hole dug by eight men sharing a backhoe. He is in a vault, black with silver highlights, manufactured less than 2 miles away and then sealed, in front of his family, by a man who lowered a 1,000-pound lid with a crane. He is in a casket made of African mahogany, with each plank 4 to 6 inches thick, so that the casket weighs 700 pounds, empty. Still very clean, he is perfumed and wrapped in three pieces of linen tied together with linen strips. Only his face shows, but it is facing east, toward Mecca, because before his casket was closed for the last time, four men -- two of them Muslim and two of them Christian -- turned him on his right side. The vault is airtight, and in his veins there are traces of the fluid used to embalm him, not desirable by Islamic standards but also not forbidden. Time conquers everything, and the elements will eventually have their way with his body, and him, as Allah intended.\n\nAnd because Muhammad Ali is still there, so is the woman born Yolanda Williams, known to all as Lonnie. She visits, knowing she was right all along: It's not only a beautiful site, it's the right site for Muhammad. It is secluded and it is peaceful, but above all it is welcoming, with two benches made from the same black African granite out of which his stone was cut. She sits on them, hoping to get the chance to speak to him. So many people think she took care of him. What they don't know -- what they can never understand -- is that he took care of her. He was always with her; he has always been with her. She met him when she was a child, so when she says that losing him was like losing a child, she says, in nearly the same breath, that losing him was like losing a father. A father, a husband, a child: a totality. He raised me, she says. And so one afternoon, as she approaches with trembling the anniversary of his death, she goes to see Muhammad again. It's Derby weekend in Louisville, so Maggie Cassaro gets to the grave before Lonnie does, dressing the lot in a flutter of rose petals in the shape of a horse collar. It overwhelms Lonnie, but then so much does since she lost her husband. She insists that people don't know her, \"ol' Lonnie.\" But she is the beneficiary of one kindness after another. She and Muhammad were optimists, she says. He not only never complained about his condition, he never complained about anything. And he never talked about death; he talked only -- and incessantly -- of the afterlife. She is an optimist still, for all her tears. She still cries easily. But she doesn't cry often at the grave because she doesn't get a chance to. She goes there to have time alone with Muhammad, but then he is never alone. He was a warrior and a will-o'-the-wisp; a praying man and a trickster; a magician who always had mischief on his mind, and he is making mischief still. Time alone with Muhammad Ali? Lonnie doesn't get five minutes. She doesn't get two minutes. She doesn't get a minute, before someone comes and visits his grave. She's supposed to have the last word. But the last word is written now for all to see, atop the shiny black stone quarried from Africa, and she can't complain if she has to share it:\n\nALI.\n\nTom JunodBefore joining ESPN as a senior writer, Junod wrote for Esquire and GQ.

    "raw_text": "The transfer window is open across Europe as clubs look to do some midseason business. But what are ESPN's reporters hearing about possible deals?\n\nEvery Friday in January, we'll bring you the latest updates and insights on the biggest transfer news.\n\nWill Christopher Nkunku be at Chelsea on Feb. 4?\n\nNkunku is determined to leave Chelsea in the next few days. The France international forward is not happy about being a fringe player for Enzo Maresca's team, where he features mostly as a starter in the UEFA Conference League. He has told the Blues' hierarchy that he wants to find a new project, and the club are not against letting him leave if their valuation is matched. However, they want to recoup the \u20ac60m they spent to sign him from RB Leipzig just 18 months ago.\n\nThe former PSG player would be happy to stay in England or go back to Germany. And sources said that Manchester United have asked to be kept informed of developments in case Alejandro Garnacho departs. -- Julien Laurens\n\nMeanwhile, Chelsea are close to reaching an agreement to sign 16-year-old Corinthians left-back Denner, but due to FIFA rules, he could only make the transfer to England after he turns 18. -- ESPN Brasil\n\nCould one of Arsenal, Chelsea, Man United, Tottenham or Villa land a late move for Bayern Munich forward Mathys Tel?\n\nYes. Bayern Munich director Max Eberl has confirmed that the 19-year-old Tel wants to leave and said: \"I've rarely had so many clubs call me about a player before.\" But although Chelsea have made a lot of the early running, Tottenham feel they have an opportunity to win the race by offering a clearer path to regular first-team football and had a \u20ac60m offer accepted on Thursday night. The player has yet to make a decision though and personal terms have not been reached.\n\nSources said that Manchester United, Aston Villa and Ligue 1 side Marseille are also interested -- although United must focus on outgoings first -- while it remains unclear if Arsenal pivot away from their pursuit of Villa striker Ollie Watkins. If they do, Tel will be one alternative. -- James Olley\n\nAfter telling Bayern that he wanted to stay, Tel has changed his mind and has opened the door to a departure before the deadline as he has become frustrated by his lack of game time this season. Bayern want \u20ac60m for a permanent deal but are hoping that a bidding war breaks out between interested clubs; Tel wants to move to England and join a team where he will play regularly -- ideally one that is in the Champions League.\n\nCurrently, Tottenham are leading the way but are not in a strong position considering their poor league performance. United have been in talks with Bayern and Tel's agent for two days, but the club has to find an exit for Marcus Rashford first, and time is running out.\n\nTel could be Arsenal's second option if they don't manage to sign Watkins, while, as James says, Chelsea were the first club to get in touch about the player early in this transfer window and could yet move if Nkunku is allowed to depart. -- Laurens\n\nWhich players could leave Man United before the deadline?\n\nMan United would consider offers to sign midfielder Christian Eriksen and defender Victor Lindel\u00f6f before the deadline, but that's optimistic because they will both be free agents this summer. Casemiro, 32, is available, and United are willing to sanction a straight loan while paying a portion of his wages. However, the Brazilian hasn't shown much desire to go this month, and he already rejected a move to Roma, which means it would take a good offer to get things moving.\n\nYoung striker Rasmus H\u00f8jlund is another interesting situation. He's not playing well, but many clubs are looking for a striker on loan. United, however, could not afford to let Antony (who has already signed for Real Betis on loan), Rashford and H\u00f8jlund leave without bringing in a replacement. -- Rob Dawson\n\nAnd what about Rashford?\n\nMan United want him out and Rashford wants to play, but this has now become a game of poker. Will United drop their financial demands or will Rashford agree to take a pay cut to move to another club? It's likely either will need to happen if he's going to go before the deadline.\n\nIt's possible that this one will go right to the wire on Monday. Which side is going to blink first? -- Dawson\n\nWhy Marcotti thinks Arsenal should go for Vlahovic over Watkins\n\nGabriele Marcotti believes that Arsenal should target Dusan Vlahovic instead of Ollie Watkins after they tabled a bid for the English striker.\n\nIs Man City's business over for January?\n\nThey hope not. The possibility that midfielder Douglas Luiz could be allowed to leave Juventus has got City boss Pep Guardiola and sporting director Txiki Begiristain interested. City would be keen on a loan for Luiz -- who used to play for the club 2017-19, but he didn't make a first-team appearance until the end of the season with an option to make it permanent. Juventus have suggested they want a permanent move now or an obligation to sign permanently in the summer.\n\nAs right-back Kyle Walker has left for Milan, there's also interest in Juventus full-back Andrea Cambiaso, whose transfer is valued at around \u20ac80m, but that might have to wait until the summer.\n\nOne thing that could be of interest is the fact that Al Nassr have a delegation based in London ahead of the SPL deadline on Friday night and one of the players being discussed is City midfielder Mateo Kovacic. As of Thursday evening, City had yet to receive contact from the Saudi club, r but informal enquiries have been made to Kovacic's representatives. It's a hard deal to do but one to keep an eye on. -- Dawson\n\nJames McAtee is likely to stay at City this month because the club is unable to loan him out of the country. City have already used their full allocation of six loans and cannot sanction another, so unless Bayer Leverkusen are prepared to make a significant offer to sign him permanently rather than on loan, he will be staying at the Etihad. -- Mark Ogden\n\nTottenham are struggling in the league, will they sign anyone?\n\nAnge Postecoglou certainly wants them to, but oddly, that is part of the problem. Postecoglou has a very specific style of play and wants players to fit that system, but the 59-year-old is under mounting pressure after a dismal run of results has left Spurs in 15th place in the Premier League. So do Spurs back a manager they may have to sack in the coming weeks? Or do they hedge their bets in the final few days of the window, either keeping their powder dry as players return from injury or sign a player the club feels is better suited to their future plans with one eye on life after Postecoglou? Either way, there is surely a consensus that the forward line needs strengthening and they've had that \u20ac60m bid for Tel accepted, although it remains to be seen if he wants to move to Spurs.\n\nCentral midfield has long needed more guile, hence the interest in Lille's Angel Gomes. Chairman Daniel Levy has long held a reputation for doing business late in the window, and here we are again. -- Olley\n\nWith only six months remaining on his contract at Lille, Gomes is attracting a lot of interest from the Premier League. At 24, the former Manchester United academy graduate wants to come home. He has been great with Lille in the last four seasons, playing in the Champions League and making his England debut. Tottenham are keen to sign him, like West Ham and Everton, but this one is probably more for the summer transfer window than the final days of January. -- Laurens\n\nIs Ricardo Pepi the answer to West Ham's striker struggles?\n\nGab Marcotti and Julien Laurens discuss USMNT striker Ricardo Pepi's reported move to Premier League side West Ham.\n\nAny other interesting deals in the works?\n\n- Brighton striker Evan Ferguson is the subject of interest from Bournemouth, West Ham, Everton and Bayer Leverkusen heading into the final days of the transfer window, with sources telling ESPN that the Republic of Ireland international could yet leave the Amex Stadium in a permanent deal. Sources said that a move to German Bundesliga would appeal to the 20-year-old, due to the success of a number of young players doing the same in recent years, but Brighton are open to a loan or a permanent transfer. -- Ogden\n\n- Chelsea defender Axel Disasi wants to go to Aston Villa and the club has received an offer for a loan with no option to sign permanently. The discussions are continuing, but all parties are optimistic a deal will happen. -- Laurens\n\n- Newcastle United have been looking closely at Real Sociedad winger Take Kubo, but the Spanish club won't let him leave this month. -- Rodri Faez\n\n- Atlanta United is closing in on the acquisition of Middlesbrough striker Latte Lath, and is prepared to break the record for an incoming transfer to MLS in order to get the $22m (plus add-ons) deal over the line. -- Jeff Carlisle\n\n- Former U.S. international forward Matthew Hoppe is set to sign with Danish side Sonderskjye, a source has confirmed to ESPN after Transfermarkt initially broke the news. Capped eight times for the U.S., Hoppe had been on the books of English Championship side Middlesbrough, but had his contract terminated by mutual consent earlier this month. -- Carlisle\n\n- Napoli want to sign PSV Eindhoven forward Noa Lang. The Italian club have offered a fee of \u20ac25m, but PSV do not want to let the 25-year-old go and instead are looking to bring in a left-back themselves, following Matteo Dams' departure to the United Arab Emirates. -- ESPN NL\n\n- Feyenoord do not want to let Mexico striker Santiago Gim\u00e9nez leave the club this month. But AC Milan are interested and are reported to be preparing a \u20ac35m offer for the 23-year-old. -- ESPN NL\n\n- Ajax are looking to bring in a left winger, but they might already have the perfect option. Carlos Forbs, who is on loan at Wolves and has made just one start and nine appearances overall in the Premier League, is in talks over an early return to Amsterdam. -- ESPN NL\n\n- Juventus midfielder Arthur Melo, who has previously played for Liverpool, Barcelona and Fiorentina, is one of the main targets for Santos after they announced the return of Neymar, but is set to move to Girona. -- ESPN Brasi\n\n- Botafogo and Cruzeiro are both looking to hire a new coach. For Botafogo, Vasco Matos (Santa Clara) is an option, while there have been rumors about former Barcelona and Inter Miami boss Gerardo Martino and ex-Liverpool and Real Madrid coach Rafael Ben\u00edtez that have not advanced. For Cruzeiro, Renato Ga\u00facho (formerly of Gr\u00eamio) has been tipped to replace Fernando Diniz. -- ESPN Brasil\n\n- Flamengo are trying to reach an agreement to sign Arsenal midfielder Jorginho, after closing a move for Juventus defender Danilo. -- ESPN Brasil\n\n- Palmeiras striker Rony has seen a move to Qatari side Al Rayyan collapse, while Palmeiras have not given up on the signing of Fulham midfielder Andreas Pereira and will wait until Monday's deadline day before restarting negotiations. -- ESPN Brasil\n\n- Toluca are still looking to sign a goalkeeper after the surprise departure of Tiago Volpi, who decided to return to Brazil with Gremio for personal reasons. Sources told ESPN there is interest in Marseille goalkeeper Pau L\u00f3pez, who is on loan at Girona of Spain. -- Adriana Maldonado, ESPN Deportes",

As always, the criteria is who they think would win a match if any of these teams played each other on a neutral field in the near future.\n\nThe updated rankings are below, followed by some analysis of the most notable changes (or non-changes) from the previous edition of our rankings, including why Man City's desperation is growing, Man United and Tottenham are in free fall, and Bournemouth and Forest are for real.\n\nThe updated Premier League team rankings\n\nThe January and November rankings -- the combination of Bill's and Ryan's individual rankings -- are listed along with the new adjustments, plus each team's present points total on the Premier League table and goal differential:\n\nManchester City need to move -- fast\n\n\"We are really pleased, we are back to doing things that define this team for the last 10 years.\"\n\nIt's not like we haven't heard Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola say things like this before. City have hit rough patches in the past. Key players have aged out of their ability to remain key players, the team's performance dropped, then Pep made some tactical tweak and boom: They resumed blowing all of their opponents off the pitch.\n\nPerhaps the above quote came after a win against one of their fellow title favorites? Maybe he said it in the afterglow of a Champions League victory against someone like Barcelona or Bayern Munich?\n\nNope! That quote came after a blowout win against Ipswich Town, the preseason favorite to finish the season at the bottom of the table. Unfortunately for Pep, your \"back\"-ness cannot be reestablished against one of the worst teams in the league. And while City have climbed back into Champions League contention, they really haven't produced a dominant match -- one where they out-create their opponents by an overwhelming degree and also, you know, win -- since they beat Nottingham Forest 3-0 at the beginning of December.\n\nThey know it, too -- why else would they be signing four (and possibly more!) players in January?\n\nWhile there are plenty of questions as to how Man City's new signings will translate to the Premier League and to Pep's demanding personnel requirements -- the same kind of questions that circle any transfer from one league to another -- there is one clear trait that makes these players different from the ones currently at the club: They're fast.\n\nThe data company PFF FC derives a number of physical statistics from broadcast data. The easiest to understand is maximum speed. It's the average of each player's maximum speed (in kilometers per hour) over his five fastest games. By this metric, Erling Haaland is the fastest player in the Premier League (35.59 km/hour). Four other City players rank in the top 100 -- Kyle Walker (25th), Josko Gvardiol (43rd), Savinho (59th) and Matheus Nunes (67th) -- but Walker is likely leaving the club this window, and Nunes clearly isn't good enough to play for Manchester City.\n\nOf the three signings immediately joining the club this winter, all of them would rank among the 100 fastest players in the Premier League. The slowest of the trio, 19-year-old center back Vitor Reis from Palmeiras, would rank 69th based on his maximum speed in Brazil. Then there's Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who would rank 57th based on his max pace in the Bundesliga.\n\nThey're all plodders, though, compared to the 20-year-old hybrid defender from Lens, Abdukodir Khusanov. Khusanov's maximum speed in Ligue 1 (35.47 km/h) would be the second fastest in the Premier League after Haaland. Khusanov is significantly faster than Walker, and he's nearly 4 inches taller.\n\nWhile we typically don't associate Guardiola's brilliantly technical teams with physical traits, their issues this season have been physical: injuries and then an inability to keep up with faster and stronger Premier League teams whenever the ball gets into open space. Based on the signings they've made so far this window, Pep and Man City know that if they are ever going to get back to where they once were, they'll need to move at a faster pace. -- O'Hanlon\n\nForest and Bournemouth aren't going away\n\nThe success of pure spending power in this sport is such that sometimes we don't enjoy underdog runs as much as we should. We just assume that history and pure cash will eventually take over, and that underdogs will fall short -- and we're almost always right. But we continue to hedge on the success of Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth this season, and they continue to win matches.\n\nSince a 3-0 loss to Manchester City on Dec. 4 -- their third loss in four matches -- Forest have taken 22 of a possible 24 points during an eight-match unbeaten run. The Premier League is almost assured of earning a bonus fifth spot in the Champions League this season, and per Opta's power ratings, Forest now have a 62% chance of finishing in the top five. Beyond that, they have an 88% chance of finishing in the top seven, meaning a European journey is likely on the way in 2025-26.\n\nThey continue to be the masters of seeing games out -- they've played in 14 matches decided by 0 or 1 goals, and they've taken 29 points from them, a 2.07 points-per-game average that leads the league (and might be unsustainable) -- and they're getting basically a goal per game from the ageless Chris Wood, who has scored in four straight league matches and is fourth in the league with 14 goals. This counterattacking squad doesn't have as many different paths to goals as the Liverpools of the world might, but the 33-year old Wood continues to find space in the box, usually just to the goalkeeper's right, and he continues to stick the ball in the net.\n\nMeanwhile, since a 2-1 loss to Brighton on Nov. 23, Bournemouth have taken 22 of a possible 30 points during a 10-match unbeaten run. Over the past two months, they've averaged as many points per game as Liverpool and Arsenal and fewer than only Forest. They're seventh in the table, and the fact that they're fourth in expected goal (or xG) differential suggests that they're almost unlucky to not be in even better shape.\n\nBournemouth have only once finished higher than 12th in the Premier League, but Opta gives them a 27% chance of finishing in the top five and a 64% chance of finishing in the top seven. They aren't as safe as Forest, but Bournemouth -- from a city of under 200,000 people with a stadium under 12,000 capacity! -- are slowly closing in on continental play.\n\nIt's honestly incredible. Manager Andoni Iraola has given them everything they possibly could have hoped for after he was hired away from overachieving Rayo Vallecano. This team counterattacks more than anyone in the league (including Forest), but that's part of a general ethos of just running as much as possible.\n\nBournemouth average the most possessions per match (94.0) and the most ball recoveries (50.8), their direct speed (the average number of meters per second that the ball travels up the pitch in a given sequence) is lower than only Forest's, and they bait their opponents into playing frantically too. Their direct speed allowed is second highest behind only Liverpool.\n\nBournemouth are going to run, they're going to make you run, they're going to draw penalties from frantic defenders in the box, and they're going to win the set piece battle. And they're winning despite youth: Not including goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, of their 11 players with at least 1,000 league minutes, eight are 25 or younger, and only one is 30 or older. And that sample doesn't even include 25-year old American Tyler Adams, who has worked his way back into the rotation nicely after a back injury. This is a story we probably aren't talking about enough. -- Connelly\n\nWho's to blame for Tottenham's free fall?\n\nThere are two main problems with Tottenham's season, which looked so promising in November and has since completely fallen apart. Well, three problems. The first: It's late January, they're one of the 10 richest teams in the world and they're only in 15th place in their own domestic league. But there are then two reasons that first problem exists.\n\nThe first: everyone is hurt. We'll run through it from back to front. Last season, Guglielmo Vicario was one of the better shot-stoppers in the league, and he played every single minute in his first year in the Premier League. This season: He has played only 54.5% of the minutes, and that number is only going to decrease thanks to an extended spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury.\n\nOne way you might be able to face playing with a backup goalkeeper for half the season would be with excellent and consistent play from your center backs. Instead, both of Tottenham's first-choice center backs have played even fewer minutes than Vicario. Cristian Romero played 81.6% of the minutes last season; this season he's down to 49.2%. Romero's partner, Micky van de Ven, has dropped from 68.4% of the minutes last season to 39.8% this season.\n\nOK, fine, but maybe you can scrape just enough performances together with a makeshift keeper-center back triangle if you've got some ground-eating, ball-dominating midfielders in front of them? Well, uh, Tottenham's two holding midfielders, Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur, have each played fewer than half of the available minutes, too: 48.9% and 34.7%.\n\nAll right, sure, but everything that happens elsewhere on the field is at best poorly understood and at worst magic. Elite attacking play can make up for lackluster midfield and defensive performances, right? Just look at Liverpool during that 2020-21 season! So, Liverpool had Mohamed Salah, Sadio Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota. Spurs have Brennan Johnson (75.4%), 32-year-old Son Heung-Min (71.0%) and Dominic Solanke (80.7%). Johnson and Solanke have, at most, two combined seasons of high-level Premier League performance between them, while Son, still the team's best attacker, has played significantly fewer minutes this season than last (85.8%).\n\nDespite all of that, this Spurs team still shouldn't be in 15th. There's probably not even anyone in Australia who would claim that the level of available talent at Tottenham is the 15th best in the league. And so, even with the injuries, doesn't that mean manager Ange Postecoglou's job should be on the line?\n\nPerhaps if they were actually playing like the 15th-best team in the league. And that brings us to the second problem with Tottenham's season: Over a sample of 20 or more games, we know that sometimes performances still don't equal results. The best predictor of actual team strength is a blend of about 70% expected goals and 30% actual goals. And by that, Spurs have been significantly better than the 15th-best team in the league:\n\nYou've got Liverpool in their own tier at the top, Arsenal in their own tier in second, and then a third tier with Chelsea, Bournemouth, Manchester City and Newcastle. Coming into the season, the second tier was Tottenham's best-case scenario -- instead, they've had a massive injury crisis and fallen down into the third tier. That's been obscured by some freak luck in close matches, but should we really be expecting much more than that?\n\nThis isn't to say that Postecoglou has been perfect or even above average. The talent is performing at its level -- not above it. And it'd be naive to call all of these injuries bad luck. Per PFF FC, this team covers more ground per match than every team other than Bournemouth, who are currently going through their own injury crisis. Postecoglou's preferred playing style is almost definitely playing into Tottenham's personnel problems.\n\nBut you can't blame all of that on him, and part of the reason you hire someone like Postecoglou in the first place is that his aggressive, high-intensity approach can produce high-variance results from season to season.\n\nIf there are behind-the-scenes issues with training techniques and you think you can hire a similar coach who won't run the risk of running his players into the ground, then sure, maybe you move on. But if you're judging Postecoglou based purely on the team's performance this season, that would be foolish. You still don't know what level this roster can reach with him as the coach because, based on minutes played, he has been able to use only about 60% of the players who get paid to play for Tottenham. -- O'Hanlon\n\nMan United haven't figured anything out yet\n\nWhen Ruben Amorim took over as manager on Nov. 11, Manchester United were 12th in the league after 11 matches, having generated 15 points with a plus-0 goal differential. He has been in charge for 11 league matches, and United have generated just 11 points with a minus-5 goal differential.\n\nSo much for a new manager bump. They continue to play like the mid-table team they've been for most of the past two years.\n\nIt was easy to assume there might be growing pains for Amorim as he attempted to switch from Erik ten Hag's 4-2-3-1 approach to a 3-4-2-1 that's relatively rare for the Premier League. (Only three teams have lined up in a 3-4-2-1 more than twice this season: United, Crystal Palace and Wolves.) Amorim has already fielded five different players in the wide midfield/wingback role that is so important to his system, and it's just going to take a while to figure things out.\n\nBoth Bruno Fernandes and 22-year old Amad Diallo (combined in these 11 matches: eight goals and seven assists from 43 chances created) have thrived under Amorim, but the team has been all over the place. Including cup play, United have enjoyed either wins or draws away against Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, but they've also lost five matches by multiple goals, including dreadful efforts against Wolves, Newcastle and Brighton. They seem capable of maximizing intensity against only the best clubs, which is a very Manchester United problem.\n\nUnited are possessing the ball as intended (their 55.2% possession rate is fifth), but they're creating minimal danger with the ball, and they're really creating none of the advantages that possession is supposed to provide. They're giving opponents few shot attempts (they're fifth in shots allowed per possession), but if we look specifically at high-quality shots (say, shots worth at least 0.2 xG), opponents are averaging 2.1 per match (seventh most) to United's 1.6 (ninth fewest). They're allowing 11.0 passes per defensive action, fourth lowest during Amorim's time (PPDA is a common metric for measuring defensive intensity), but they rank just 12th in high turnovers created and 13th in goals from high turnovers.\n\nThen, with no easy scoring opportunities from high turnovers, no threat of verticality and minimal set piece presence, United aren't creating easy looks. They've had 38% of their shot attempts under Amorim blocked, most in the league, and any hope of a surge back into European contention has quickly dissipated. Per Opta's power ratings, they have a 0.0% chance of finishing in the Premier League top five at this point, and they have only a 0.4% chance of finishing in the top seven.\n\nHonestly? That should be freeing. United haven't done any business in the January transfer window, they aren't going to charge back toward the top of the table, and no matter what Amorim might say, they aren't in a relegation scrap either (odds of relegation, per Opta: 0.1%).\n\nManchester United's almost perfect mediocrity has actually created an opportunity for them to be patient, let Amorim experiment and teach his system, and focus almost entirely on making cup runs.",

    "raw_text": "Finishing fifth in the Premier League table, while scoring just 46 goals made Louis van Gaal's departure from Manchester United inevitable. Here are the eight matches that doomed the Dutch manager.\n\n1. Manchester United 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur, Aug. 8\n\nFrom a full season's distance, beating a Spurs team who would eventually challenge for the title and would not lose again in the Premier League until December looks a decent result.\n\nIn truth, however, the pattern of the season was laid out by Van Gaal's team. United were stale, stodgy and needed an own goal from Kyle Walker to win after Wayne Rooney's lumpen touch played the ball on to the defender.\n\nIt all signalled that the achingly dull football with which United closed out fourth place in 2014-15 was back in session. Afterwards, Van Gaal sang The Beatles' \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" to mark his birthday, but there had been little else on show to celebrate.\n\n2. PSV Eindhoven 2-1 Manchester United, Sept. 15\n\nReaching the Champions League was the previous season's target. Reaching the knockout round was this term's. Defeat in Eindhoven suggested that would be no formality and it proved a terrible cost.\n\nLuke Shaw had been the bright spark of early season, fitter, stronger and the team's most threatening attacking outlet when overlapping from left-back. His campaign was finished by a hefty challenge by Mexico's Hector Moreno, which shattered Shaw's right leg in two places.\n\nUnited took the lead but eventually succumbed. That night, Shaw's loss was the leading concern, but the manner of defeat suggested trouble ahead.\n\n3. Wolfsburg 3-2 Manchester United, Dec. 8\n\nMany of United's defeats under Van Gaal have seen an unravelling of the tight controls he desires preluding a descent into unmanageable chaos. This was a most striking example.\n\nA previous goalless draw with PSV had placed hopes of reaching the last 16 on a knife's edge, but at 2-2, and PSV drawing with CSKA Moscow, United were going through, yet conceded a late goal to Wolfsburg's Naldo, just as PSV went ahead.\n\nAt last, some excitement after months of drudgery, yet it derived from the high farce of United's utterly disorganised performance rather than thrilling attacking play. Nick Powell, who had not played for the first team for 15 months and was imminently headed for Hull on loan, was bizarrely sent on as a substitute. He proved himself no Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\n4. Stoke City 2-0 Manchester United, Dec. 26\n\nFour losses in a row followed that night in Germany, and pencils were sharpened for the obituary of Van Gaal's United tenure. This Boxing Day lunchtime kickoff was the lowest point. Goals from Bojan Krkic and Marko Arnautovic had given Stoke their eventual winning margin by the 26th minute, yet United idled the rest of the game out, toothless in attack.\n\nJose Mourinho, sacked nine days earlier by Chelsea, had become a spectre to haunt the Dutchman. It was at this point that the identity of Van Gaal's successor became an open topic of discussion.\n\n5. Sunderland 2-1 Manchester United, Feb. 13\n\nAnd yet Van Gaal proved himself a survivor. After Stoke, United lost just one of their next nine games, a home defeat to a handy Southampton team on Jan. 23, having won 1-0 at Liverpool the previous week. And in Cameron Borthwick-Jackson and Jesse Lingard, young talent was adding a veneer of respectability to a manager who prides himself on honing promising prospects.\n\nThen came this visit to Wearside and a return to the uninspired fare that galled United fans. David De Gea, outstanding all season, dropped a clanger in diverting Lamine Kone's header into the net. Van Gaal was forced to admit, with three months of the season still left, that returning to the Champions League would be \"very difficult.\"\n\n6. Liverpool 2-0 Manchester United, Mar. 10\n\nDutch observers frequently refer to Van Gaal as a lucky manager and he struck fortunate gold in the unearthing of Marcus Rashford, a late call in the Europa League against FC Midtjylland. Rashford scored twice in that game and then against Arsenal. A revival suddenly seemed possible before a 1-0 Mar. 6 loss at West Brom. At Anfield, the bandwagon crashed again.\n\nBeating the Danish minnow had set up the first ever European tie with United's avowed rivals, and humiliation followed at Anfield, ending Van Gaal's previous 100 percent record against Liverpool. It was a return to listless, shapeless football of a type that meant Van Gaal will be lamented by few United fans. Liverpool's two-goal lead all but killed a return leg that was drawn 1-1.\n\n7. Tottenham 3-0 Manchester United, Apr. 10\n\nA reunion with Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs provided telling evidence of the two teams' development since their early August meeting. Though the home team were drawn into United's quagmire for the opening hour, they then plundered their goals in a fashion beyond Van Gaal's leaden team. With Manchester City lately recovering their step, the top four ebbed beyond reach.\n\nThree strikes in six second-half minutes from Dele Alli, Toby Alderweireld and Erik Lamela broke a tepid resistance that had been weakened by injury to teenage defender Tim Fosu-Mensah, another kid on whom Van Gaal had come to rely. Rashford, meanwhile, had been subbed off at half-time, with Ashley Young asked to play a centre-forward's role he had not fulfilled for a decade.\n\nReports later emerged of a half-time row between Van Gaal and his players, with Rashford at its epicentre.\n\n8. West Ham 3-2 Manchester United, May. 10\n\nA month earlier, United had travelled to Upton Park for an FA Cup quarterfinal replay and had come away with a 2-1 victory. That, and winning the semifinal against Everton, gave Van Gaal chance to sign off with silverware.\n\nCity's slide, meanwhile, had opened up a return route to the Champions League. Six points from their last two matches and United would make the top four. With destiny in their hands, they fell at the first hurdle -- on the occasion of the final match ever staged at West Ham's outgoing stadium.\n\nAnthony Martial's double put United into a 2-1 lead, but they could not hold off the tide of emotion that powered the Hammers to a farewell victory. United were done in by a pair of crosses, as first Michail Antonio and then Winston Reid crashed home headers. That left City needing only a draw from their final game at Swansea. They duly collected it, limping across the line, yet still denying Van Gaal the position in the table that might have saved him.",

Ball is averaging 28.2 points, 7.3 assists and 5.3 rebounds.\n\nHowever, the Hornets announced Wednesday that he is out for at least one week due to an ankle sprain. Charlotte posted a meme without a caption to express its displeasure.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings chimed in too after center Domantas Sabonis didn't earn a spot. Sabonis leads the league in double doubles (42) and rebounds per game (14.2) alongside 20.9 points. TNT's Ernie Johnson said he was surprised he didn't hear Sabonis' name as a reserve.\n\nSacramento made sure to reference those comments.\n\nThe All-Star starters were announced last Thursday, led by LeBron James -- his record-extending 21st selection -- and Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led all players in fan voting.\n\nFestivities begin Feb. 14 in the Bay Area.",

    "raw_text": "The first season of the new 36-team, single-league table UEFA Champions League built to a crescendo on Wednesday night with all the final games kicking off at the same time -- and it delivered the drama and chaos we crave.\n\nMuch of the focus, naturally, fell on the varying fortunes of the big guns: Manchester City squeezed into top 24, Paris Saint-Germain needed a win to be certain of qualifying, while AC Milan fell unceremoniously out of the top eight with a 2-1 loss to Dinamo Zagreb.\n\nBut for every top team underperforming, there's an underdog seizing their moment and taking their place. And during this phase, Aston Villa, Lille, Brest, Celtic and Club Brugge certainly rose to the occasion as they all secured unexpected placings in the next round.\n\nThere are some common themes among the teams who exceed expectations: They all benefited from the new format's more egalitarian outlook on fixtures, they all had one particularly spectacular result that changed their outlook, and almost all of them can thank their goalkeepers for some truly sensational performances.\n\nLILLE\n\nFinished Top 8\n\nWhat drove their success: Brilliant goalkeeping, young stars flourishing and Jonathan David penalties\n\nLille fought tooth and nail to even get into the Champions League group phase, counting on a 118th-minute penalty from Jonathan David to beat Fenerbahce in the third qualifying round then squeezing past Slavia Prague 3-2 on aggregate to make the league phase. The range of emotions these players and fans had experienced before they'd even confirmed their place in the competition proper was remarkable.\n\nLille started poorly, falling 2-0 to Sporting CP in a run of four straight losses across all competitions. It was a surprise to everyone, therefore, when they tightened up and deservedly beat Real Madrid 1-0 in the second game; then came a downright shock when a heavily rotated and young XI sent to play Atl\u00e9tico Madrid returned with a 3-1 win.\n\nDavid scored a penalty in each of those games, which became a clear theme of their Champions League campaign, but it's important that doesn't distract from another important theme: Bruno G\u00e9n\u00e9sio's bold decision to trust youngsters on the biggest stage. Ayyoub Bouaddi played against Real Madrid on his 17th birthday, three of the starters away to Atleti were aged 20 or younger, and 20-year-old Ngal'Ayel Mukau was the man of the match with two goals in the win over Bologna. Underpinning all of this was Lucas Chevalier's excellence between the sticks. The 23-year-old is one of Europe's finest young goalkeepers and delivered fine performances.\n\nOpta gave Lille just a 33% chance of reaching the top eight heading into the final night, but beating Feyenoord 6-1 in a bizarre game that featured two own-goals by the same player, Gernot Trauner, allowed them to edge past AC Milan and Atalanta.\n\nMoreno: Jhon Dur\u00e1n transfer should be a 'no-brainer' for Aston Villa\n\nAlejandro Moreno, Craig Burley and Steve Nicol discuss the transfer rumors surrounding Aston Villa forwards Jhon Dur\u00e1n and Ollie Watkins.\n\nASTON VILLA\n\nFinished Top 8\n\nWhat drove their success: A famous Bayern win, Jhon Dur\u00e1n wondergoals and Morgan Rogers' breakout season\n\nThis is Aston Villa's first Champions League campaign for 42 years, and while Premier League teams are expected to perform strongly in Europe, a top-eight finish wasn't ever seriously talked about before the competition began. But three straight wins to begin, including a famous 1-0 victory over Bayern Munich, changed expectations and paved the path to success.\n\nThose first three performances were very different to the following five -- they came at a time where Villa were playing confident football, so Young Boys and Bologna were dismantled, while Bayern were seen off thanks to incredible grit, determination and a wondergoal from Jhon Dur\u00e1n. Morgan Rogers also exploded onto the European scene, as his direct dribbling style took teams apart.\n\nFrom there, things got stickier, and in the end Villa did just enough, overcoming some bizarre moments to qualify. In their trips to Monaco and Club Brugge they struggled. And in Brugge, Tyrone Mings picked the ball up in his own box from a goal kick (resulting in the penalty that won the game). On the penultimate day in Leipzig, they played exhilarating-but-fragile football to win 3-2.\n\nThat left a must-win home bout with Celtic on a final matchday which ended up a carnival of emotion. They went 2-0 up, were pegged back to 2-2, hit the post, had a shot cleared off the line and missed a penalty en route to an eventual 4-2 win, with Rogers completing a hat trick late on to seal it.\n\nBREST\n\nA comfortable top-24 finish\n\nWhat drove their success: Overcoming injuries, counter-attacking masterclasses and goalkeeping heroics\n\nBrest finished 14th in Ligue 1 in 2022-23, so for them to find themselves in the Champions League just over a year later is a remarkable achievement in itself. The conservative target going into the competition was to simply be competitive, yet they ended up comfortably qualifying for the playoffs and were even in contention to finish in the top eight going into the final gameweek.\n\nThey did this despite not being able to strengthen considerably during the summer window (Ligue 1's broadcasting revenue situation affected all teams bar Paris Saint-Germain), not playing home games at their own stadium (it's not up to UEFA standard) and they also lost two of last season's shining stars -- Pierre Lees-Melou and Bradley Locko -- to injury.\n\nBrest could, and probably should, have collapsed, but their ability to overcome those setbacks and collectively step up was immense. Their game plan was to weather attacking storms and counterpunch with pace -- an age-old tactic that worked perfectly. The man who made that possible was goalkeeper Marco Bizot, who put in a handful of exceptional performances to keep them in games and allow the strategy to play out (if you watch the highlights, you can hear the crowd chanting \"Bizot Bizot! Bizot!\" after big saves.)\n\nWhy Real Madrid wouldn't be thrilled to face Man City in knockout stage\n\nAlex Kirkland discusses the possibility of another Real Madrid vs. Man City showdown in the Champions League.\n\nCELTIC\n\nA comfortable top-24 finish\n\nWhat drove their success: Peak Kasper Schmeichel, beating Pot 4 teams and that night against RB Leipzig\n\nCeltic are a household European name with more historical success at this level than the vast majority of clubs, but this past decade has represented slim pickings for them in the Champions League. The last time they reached the latter stages of the competition was 2013; since then it has been a lot of fourth-placed group finishes or qualifying stage eliminations. So although the goalposts have been moved a little -- widened, you might say, given eight more teams qualify now than before -- accruing 12 points is proof they've turned up and changed the narrative this year, regardless of the format.\n\nCeltic's start to the tournament was wild: They beat Slovan Bratislava 5-1, then lost to Borussia Dortmund 7-1. From there, though, they settled into a groove of being hard to beat, relying on goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, who hit top form on the big nights.\n\nThen came a magical night against RB Leipzig, when Celtic winger Nicolas Gerrit K\u00fchn scored twice in a 3-1 win, prompting newspaper German Bild into an existential crisis, running the stunned headline: \"German no-name embarrasses Leipzig!\" (which is odd, considering he spent three years at Leipzig from 2015 to '18)\n\nSchmeichel had time for one more tremendous night, at Villa Park, where he pulled off a host of magnificent saves to make things nervy for Aston Villa, completing an incredible individual league phase.\n\nCLUB BRUGGE\n\nSqueezed into the playoffs\n\nWhat drove their success: Consistency of selection, a bit of luck and Hans Vanaken's calm control\n\nMake no mistake, Club Brugge are no strangers to the Champions League; they've played over 100 games in this tournament and have been a fairly consistent presence since 2015. But rarely have they looked this competitive and difficult to handle.\n\nThe secret to their power lies in the consistency of their team selection: Six players started all eight league phase fixtures, while four more started all but one. But for a red card to Raphael Onyedika and a January transfer exit for Andreas Skov Olsen, they would have come mightily close to a full 100% record with the same 11 players.\n\nSo perhaps it's no surprise that Brugge were able to dig in and defend like a well-drilled army unit, then spring away on the counter and do some damage. Hans Vanaken, their captain and midfield heartbeat, played brilliantly, consistently picking the right pass at the right time to ensure chances were created.\n\nHis focus was on bringing forward Christos Tzolis into the game as often as possible and though he may have only scored once in eight games, he was a lively presence in the absence of a proper goal-scoring No. 9 striker.",

    "raw_text": "It's funny how much things can change in a year.\n\nLast year, our list of the best under-21 prospects for the U.S. men's national team was filled with a lot of guys who aren't really prospects. No, it included plenty of first-choice, or first-off-the-bench types, for the senior national team. Giovanni Reyna, Yunus Musah, Ricardo Pepi, Joe Scally, Malik Tillman, Gianluca Busio? They were all there.\n\nAnd now they're all gone -- most recently Pepi, who turned 22 on Jan. 9. He would be No. 1 on this list were he born just a week or two later. Heck, Busio ranked 10th on this list last time -- had he been just a year younger, with the same track record he had a year ago, he probably would have been first this time, too. Unfortunately, he was born in May 2022.\n\nThis is why people talk about \"Golden Generations\" with national teams. Even when the broader trend of youth talent is broadly positive, as it is with the USMNT, things can get pretty volatile from one year to the next. Sometimes you just get a concentration of excellent players all born in the same year and sometimes, well, you don't -- like this year.\n\nNow that your expectations are sufficiently lowered, let's do it all again. Ahead of the USMNT's friendlies with Venezuela and Costa Rica, who are the program's 15 best under-21 prospects?\n\nWait, what do we mean by a USMNT 'prospect'?\n\nManchester City, Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid, Liverpool, Bayer Leverkusen, Chelsea: All of these clubs have Americans under contract right now. The only problem: They're all teenagers without any real professional experience. And the most likely outcome for almost every teenager yet to play a professional game? He won't be a contributor for his national team.\n\nBy having so many young players at so many of the world's best clubs, the USMNT is greatly increasing its chances of having a couple of those players turn into USMNT stars, but there is just so much that can and will change for a 17-year-old prospect who -- unless he's Lamine Yamal -- it's foolish to put any kind of confident projection on how any single players' career will pan out.\n\nIf this were easy, then most of the best players in the world would be the ones who come through the academies of the best teams in the world. Instead, that's very rarely the case unless, again, you're Lamine Yamal.\n\nAnd so here's how these rankings are decided, as was the case in last year's edition:\n\nHumility is the No. 1 scouting tool -- we can't be confident in how any 21-and-under player's career will pan out. So, these rankings will be heavily weighted toward players we can have a little more confidence about.\n\nThat weight, in order: We care about players who have played a lot of minutes, then we care about players who have played a lot of minutes at a younger age, then we care about what level of competition those players have played those minutes in, then we care about how they have performed within those minutes, and only then do we really care about things like traits or tools or whatever other scouting terms you prefer.\n\nWe're also not including players like Burnley's Luca Koleosho and Stuttgart's Anrie Chase, who are eligible for the USMNT despite showing no real interest in actually playing for the USMNT. And like last year, players are divided into tiers, and we'll use those same tiers this time. Here's how it looks:\n\nTier 1: USMNT stars -- and potentially European stars, too\n\nThere are undoubtedly some players out there who have this kind of potential. Some of you are probably smashing the letters \"C-A-V-A-N S-U-L-L-I-V-A-N\" into an email window as you read this. People have referred to the Philadelphia Union prospect, who will move to Manchester City when he turns 18, as the best 15-year-old in the world.\n\nBut just think about that for a second: HE IS 15 YEARS OLD. We literally don't even know how tall Cavan Sullivan is going to be in five years, let alone how effective he will be at soccer.\n\nSomeone is going to find his way into this tier eventually, but there are not currently any 21-and-under soccer players who I'm willing to say are more likely than not to become a star for the USMNT.\n\nTier 2: Fringe USMNT starters, mid-tier European pros\n\nIn Europe's Big Five top leagues, here's the list of 21-and-under Americans, per FBref, who have played at least 2,000 minutes:\n\nJust kidding, there's no one. Last year, this tier featured Joe Scally, Malik Tillman and Ricardo Pepi. This year, it's empty.\n\nTier 3: Can they make it in Europe?\n\n1. Kevin Paredes, 21, winger, Wolfsburg\n\n2. Caleb Wiley, 20, left back, Strasbourg (on loan from Chelsea)\n\n3. Paxten Aaronson, 21, midfielder, FC Utrecht (on loan from Eintracht Frankfurt)\n\n4. Noahkai Banks, 18, center back, Augsburg\n\n5. Damion Downs, 20, forward, Koln\n\nOne of my favorite things to read each week is the Bayesian Quarterback Rankings from NFL analyst Kevin Cole on his Substack, \"Unexpected Points.\" Rather than just adding up the player's stats from the current season to create the rankings, he looks at the stats for each quarterback across his career (while weighing recent performance more heavily), and then projects who is likely to perform the best going forward. Even in a relatively down year by his incredible standards, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes remains at the top each week because his career-long track record is so far ahead of any other player.\n\nThe opposite, though, happens with rookie quarterbacks. They come into the rankings with loose expectations based on their draft positions, but that is quickly overwhelmed by the evidence of their initial professional performances. Three games, say, is a small sample, but for a rookie, it's also the entire sample.\n\nThis is how I think of prospects in soccer, too. With Christian Pulisic, we have a pretty big sample of what to expect. A single game, or even a couple months, shouldn't really sway our opinion of the player all that much. But with these under-21 guys, I think we need to constantly be updating our opinions with each new bit of information we get.\n\nSee: Noahkai Banks. He's been near the top of the list for USMNT prospects-watchers for a while, but I wouldn't have had him here if we did this exercise a week ago. Except then he made his professional debut for Augsburg over the weekend.\n\nAll of a sudden, with his hourlong cameo against Stuttgart, Banks is an 18-year-old center-back who has played more minutes in a Big Five league than all but four other U-21 Americans. Not only that, but he's also done it at a position that's not kind to teenagers. Among center-backs who were 17 or younger at the start of this season, only two players have been featured in more minutes than Banks, Giovanni Leoni of Parma and Barcelona prodigy Pau Cubars\u00ed.\n\nKevin Paredes, meanwhile, stays atop the list because we've seen him play nearly 2,000 minutes at a young age in the Bundesliga. He's missed the season with a number of lower-body injuries, but no one else has really done enough to surpass him this season.\n\nCaleb Wiley played a ton of minutes as a teenager in MLS for Atlanta United. That earned him a move to Chelsea -- great sign! But he's spent the season on loan at Chelsea's satellite club, Strasbourg, and has only played 250-plus minutes in Ligue 1, thanks to a succession of knee and shoulder injuries. He looked like a Ligue 1-quality player at just 20, but just hasn't played enough.\n\nPaxten Aaronson, meanwhile, has been fantastic in midfield for third-place Utrecht, but unless you're playing for a Champions League team, it's really hard to judge the true quality of a prospect's minutes in the Eredivisie. Plenty go on to flourish at a higher level, while plenty of others wilt under the increased physicality and defensive organization in the Big Five leagues. We'll learn a lot more if he heads back to Germany next year.\n\nFinally, Damion Downs played a little bit for Koln in their relegation season last year, but he's been one of the best forwards in the German second division for easily the best team in the German second division this season.\n\nTier 4: How do you judge any of them?\n\n6. Gaga Slonina, 20, goalkeeper, Chelsea\n\n7. Rokas Pukstas, 20, midfielder, Hajduk Split\n\n8. Cole Campbell, 18, forward, Borussia Dortmund\n\n9. Diego Kochen, 18, goalkeeper, Barcelona\n\nOn the one hand, Gaga Slonina's career has stalled. He went on loan to Barnsley in League One this summer, but that loan was just terminated after he struggled for playing time and then with a seasonlong injury. On the other hand, goalkeepers tend to peak much later than outfield players, and he was a starter in MLS and the Belgian first division before he turned 20. The early career minutes at a position typically reserved for older players bodes well for Slonina's future projection, even if this is going to be a lost season.\n\nRokas Pukstas broke out last year by becoming a full-time starter for one of the best teams in Croatia as a teenager. This season, he's playing significantly fewer minutes, but he's still been out there for more than half of the available game time. He's doing it for the team that's tied on points atop the Croatian league table. And he's still only 20.\n\nCole Campbell is another favorite of USMNT-prospect-watchers, and he's played just a little over 30 minutes for Dortmund as an 18-year-old. That's barely anything, but when you combine the pedigree with a Champions League appearance, I feel comfortable sliding him into the tier above the guys playing lots of minutes in lower-level leagues.\n\nSame goes for Diego Kochen, who has literally zero professional minutes under his belt. But unlike Campbell, who can come on for tiny stretches at the end of matches in Dortmund's attack, Kochen is a goalkeeper, and managers don't sub their goalkeepers. Just ask Matt Turner.\n\nKochen, though, has already appeared on Barcelona's bench 30 times in his career. That's sort of a sad thing to celebrate, I guess, but there's probably at least a little of a signal in a goalkeeper who makes it that far up the pecking order for one of the biggest clubs in the world well before his 21st birthday.\n\nTier 5: Six more, plus everyone else\n\n10. Quinn Sullivan, 20, winger, Philadelphia Union\n\n11. Jack McGlynn, 21, midfielder, Philadelphia Union\n\n12. Brian Gutierrez, 21, midfielder, Chicago Fire\n\n13. Cade Cowell, winger, 21, Chivas Guadalajara\n\n14. Chris Brady, 20, goalkeeper, Chicago Fire\n\n15. Diego Luna, 21, attacking midfielder, Real Salt Lake\n\nLast year, I said the bottom tier was occupied by the guys I listed in the bottom tier -- and then a long list of other players who didn't make the top 15. I think that's mostly true again this year, but I do think these six have separated themselves a tiny bit from the rest of the player pool below them.\n\nWhile it's really hard to value a player's performance in a full-time MLS role vs. a bit-part role at a major European club, it's a lot easier to compare all of the players across MLS. Here, we can also start to take a look at actual performance, in addition to playing time. And we can do that by using Michael Imburgio's DAVIES model, which is the best publicly available metric that values everything a player does with the ball.\n\nThe model has data dating to the 2017-18 season for some European leagues and 2019 for MLS. Among 21-and-under seasons by American players, the best -- by far -- was Folarin Balogun's 2022-23 season with Reims. His overall DAVIES total -- a number that represents the goals a player provided above average, when controlling for both age and position -- was 7.85. No other under-21 American has broken 5.0.\n\nHowever, Jack McGlynn's season with the Union last year was the fourth best from a 21-and-under American. Except, Quinn Sullivan's age-20 season last year with the Union was better than McGlynn's the year before, so we're giving Sullivan the slight edge.\n\nOne constant, from the DAVIES data is that most of the recent players who have gone on to become starters for the USMNT have put up positive seasons at age 20 or even younger. Brian Gutierrez did it at 19 and 20 and then he had another really nice season at 21 this past year. Cade Cowell, too, put up value-adding seasons at 18 and 19 in MLS and now he's playing half of the minutes for Chivas in Liga MX. All four of these guys should end up being solid pros somewhere -- and possibly back-end depth for the USMNT.\n\nChris Brady doesn't have any DAVIES data because he's a goalkeeper, but his Fire teammate Gutierrez is the only 21-and-under player still in MLS who has played more career minutes. He's still only 20 and already has two full seasons of league-average shot stopping in MLS. He's also a couple months older than Slonina.\n\nLastly, there's Diego Luna, who was on the same level as McGlynn, Sullivan and Guttierez last season, but doesn't also have those one or two seasons of above-average performance before turning 21. Chances are that someone in this group goes on to become a solid USMNT contributor over the next few years. Luna, though, seems the least likely of the six to get there.",

    "raw_text": "By the third day, Mechalle Brown's concern had dissolved into firm resolve, so she flung open the door to her son's bedroom, snapped up the shades, cranked the windows and announced, \"We're not doing this anymore.\"\n\nJaylen Brown, blinking from the sudden daylight, sighed heavily. He had sequestered himself in darkness and solitude for the better part of the weekend, emerging only when his mother coaxed him out with culinary bribes: jambalaya pasta for dinner, French toast for breakfast. Anything, she would later admit, to stir him from his funk.\n\nBut now Mechalle had seen enough.\n\n\"Today is a school day,\" she informed her son, \"and you are going.\"\n\nJaylen groaned, dragged himself out of bed and plodded to the bathroom to shower.\n\nIt was March 2014, and Brown was a top national basketball prospect at Wheeler High School in Marietta, Georgia, starring for a powerhouse team heavily favored to win the state championship. But Tift County -- donning T-shirts declaring, \"No Buckets!\" -- had jumped Wheeler, forcing 13 first-half turnovers. Brown led his team in scoring with 17 points but fouled out with three minutes to play and slumped on the bench as his singular goal for the past three seasons -- bring home the title -- unraveled in front of him.\n\nHe glanced into the bathroom mirror as he replayed the events of the past 48 hours yet again. Brown blanched from a wave of nausea, then leaned over and vomited into the sink.\n\n\"I had attached my life to basketball so closely that it made me physically ill,\" Brown says now.\n\nBrown would not attend a single day of school that week. His physical and mental devastation over the loss prompted a discourse with his mother, who spelled out her expectations. Disappointment, she explained, is part of life, and you must use it to grow stronger. It's fine to be passionate about basketball, but it cannot matter more than family, education, your health.\n\nThis is your mantra, Mechalle advised her teenage son: Basketball is not who you are. It's what you do.\n\n\"It was a turning point,\" Mechalle says. \"Jaylen needed to understand life was going to throw a lot of things at you, but you can't let them make or break you.\"\n\nFour years later, Jaylen Brown, now 21, generates as many headlines for his posture as a basketball Renaissance man as he does for becoming the youngest Boston Celtics player in history to score 30 points in a playoff game, which he did Tuesday night in a rousing win over the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nBrown's diverse portfolio -- public forums at Harvard, challenging a child prodigy to a chess match -- leads to inevitable skepticism that seems to dog well-rounded professional athletes: Does he care enough about the game?\n\nHe does. He just can't afford to care too much.\n\n\"I don't ever want to experience that again,\" Brown says. \"Looking back, I definitely suffered a [bout of] depression. But people don't want to hear about that. It freaks them out.\n\n\"I wish people were more comfortable talking about it. But they aren't, so we keep it to ourselves. We're supposed to be 'a man,' we're supposed to bottle everything up.\n\n\"I came out of it realizing, 'OK, this basketball thing, it meant a little too much.'\"\n\nThe ongoing task has been to find balance in a game that has come to define him, on a team that has come to depend on him, in a league in which every high and every low is dissected and accentuated in a high-profile manner. It has been a useful exercise; in fact, it might very well have saved Brown's young Celtics career.\n\nThe offensive development of Jaylen Brown has become a trendy talking point now that his back-to-back career-high playoff performances have staked the Celtics a 2-0 first-round series lead over the Bucks. Even before that, Toronto coach Dwane Casey likened Brown to Scottie Pippen. The wildly premature Kobe Bryant comparisons are flattering, too, but Brown knows the drill: \"Brad Stevens is a defensive coach. If I want any shot at getting on the floor, I gotta know what I'm doing defensively.\"\n\nThat has been a work in progress. Boston's defensive rotations require alert, precise, collaborative participation. As a rookie last season, Brown had to learn on the fly how to identify various NBA actions and anticipate where the next threat was coming from. It was both confounding and confusing, and he executed it with mixed results.\n\n\"You have to see two cuts ahead,\" Stevens explains. \"If you are the fifth defender on a play, you won't be the fifth defender for long. Most 19-year-olds aren't ready for that. It's a difficult adjustment that becomes more difficult on the biggest stage, where there's no place to hide.\"\n\n\"Everybody talks about development and enhancement. Nobody talks about rocky times and how you handle those. To me, that's a bigger launching pad.\" Brad Stevens\n\nBrown's length, quickness and basketball acumen spurred Stevens to challenge his young talent to become an elite defender. His 0.829 points per play rating last season, per Synergy Sports, ranked him better than all but 14 percent of the league's defenders, but, Stevens reminded him, he could be better. Much better.\n\n\"We realize how Jaylen defends is a big part of us,\" his coach says.\n\nLast season, Brown's defensive quantitative shot-making (qSM) was minus-2.7, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The qSM stat is a measure of how shooters differ from their expected effective field goal percentage. Brown's mark last season was 27th overall. This season, he ranks seventh overall in the NBA among players who defended at least 500 shots, with a minus-4.5 qSM, a notable improvement.\n\n\"It's night and day [from last season],\" veteran Al Horford says. \"I look at him on film all the time. Before, we would tell him, 'Jaylen, you can't get back cut out of the corner.' He would walk into the game and -- boom! -- back cut out of the corner right away.\"\n\nWhen Brown did grasp the rotations, the results were startling. Stevens was so impressed with one particular sequence, seen here from a Jan. 7, 2017, game against New Orleans, he spliced it into the team's film session. Brown hedges to help on superstar Anthony Davis, then sprints to the corner to contest E'Twaun Moore's 3-point offering by leaping into the air and extending his arm like an erector set.\n\nOpponents often delight in exposing first-year players in isolation, yet Brown held his own last season. He gave up just 0.9 points per chance in isos, good for 66th in the league, per ESPN Stats & Info research. (Those numbers have improved to 0.79 points/chance on isos this season for a 17th-best league mark.)\n\nBrown craved opportunities to guard elite scorers. He exhibited pockets of success against heavyweights such as LeBron James and Klay Thompson and got torched (along with the rest of the Celtics team) by Devin Booker. Usually, vets dish some smack as they blow by rookies, but, Brown said, \"Nobody knew who I was, so they didn't bother. The only people who talked trash to me were my own teammates.\"\n\nLast season's Celtics roster was stockpiled with underpaid veterans who stalked the hallways of the practice facility with chips the size of Ferris wheels on their shoulders. The uncommon demeanor and quiet confidence of a blue-chip prospect such as Brown, whose mellow visage masks his true competitiveness, occasionally landed him in the crosshairs of his teammates. There was the celebrated squabble with Marcus Smart last March during a win over the Timberwolves, when Brown freelanced his way to the hoop on a drive (and missed). The next time down the floor, an animated Smart scolded him, \"Wait on the play!\" Isaiah Thomas was notorious for riding Brown hard for his defensive lapses -- even though IT's own defensive rating was among the worst in the league.\n\n\"Jaylen didn't know the [defensive] rotations,\" former Celtic Gerald Green says. \"The guys would get on him. I pulled Jaylen aside and told him, 'They just want you to be better.' To his credit, he didn't say, 'F--- this, I don't want to be everyone's punching bag.' Instead, he said, 'OK, I understand.'\"\n\n\"Last year was definitely a different group\" Horford concedes. \"We had some guys out here scrapping, grinding but also doing a lot of talking. No one really pulled Jaylen under their wing. But Jaylen observed, he listened, and I think he learned a lot.\"\n\nTeammates have grown accustomed to Brown's unusual dalliances and his tendency to carve his own path. During All-Star Weekend, while his NBA peers were trying to score tickets for Michael Jordan's Bel Air bash, Brown was hitting up Fortune 500 representatives to attend his tech summit. He explores these avenues without apologies -- \"Basketball is what I do, not who I am\" -- and with the understanding it has the potential to set him apart from the mainstream vibe of the locker room.\n\n\"It's hard when you are so young to take those chances,'' Horford says. \"I don't know if I would have been able to do it at his age. I admire Jaylen. For most of us, it takes years to become comfortable in your own skin. Jaylen is already there.''\n\nBrown bided his time during his rookie season, aching for more minutes he felt certain he deserved. When Avery Bradley strained his Achilles tendon and missed 16 games in February 2017, Brown was plugged into the starting lineup. Instead of harassing second-unit players, Brown was suddenly chasing around CJ McCollum and JJ Redick. \"We threw him to the wolves,'' Stevens says.\n\nYet the Celtics went 13-3 with Brown in the lineup, and the rookie's confidence soared.\n\n\"When I got the opportunity to start, I felt like I had earned something,'' Brown says. \"I was mistaken.''\n\nWhen Bradley returned, he resumed his starting role while Brown reluctantly retreated back to the bench. Defense is Boston's identity, and as Brown's rookie regular season came to a close, he detected a pattern in the final month. If he missed a shot, he was encouraged to shoot another. But if he missed a defensive assignment, his stint on the floor ended abruptly.\n\nWhen the 2017 playoffs began, Brown poised himself for a coming-out party. Instead, he languished on the bench during a first-round series against the Chicago Bulls, averaging just 5.8 minutes a game.\n\n\"When we threw him in there for that first game, the intensity -- that's what people don't realize -- it's so heightened,\" Horford explains. \"There's no time for 'my bad' on defense. You have to be locked in. Jaylen can be a little laid-back at times, and, mentally, I just don't think he was where he needed to be in that series.\"\n\nThere were also other factors at work. During the regular season, Jae Crowder was the most frequent defender on Bulls star Jimmy Butler, but he was ineffective, so Stevens switched Bradley onto Butler, making him indispensable on the floor and cutting into Brown's time.\n\nAfter falling behind 2-0 in the series, Stevens made another move: replacing Amir Johnson in the starting lineup with the veteran Green, who rewarded his coach's faith in him by chipping in with eight points in Game 3, then exploding for 18 points and seven boards in Game 4. Green gobbled up the rest of Brown's minutes, leaving the rookie as the odd man out.\n\nStevens, sensing Brown's despair, initiated an impromptu meeting with him before Game 6 at the team hotel in Chicago.\n\n\"I knew it was hard for Jaylen,\" Stevens says. \"I'm sure he was pissed at me. At the same, he just kept working.\"\n\n\"I've seen young guys break down. They're cruising along, playing great, then their minutes get funky and they fall apart. Some of them never recover. That didn't happen with Jaylen.\" Gerald Green\n\nStevens stressed to Brown it wasn't so much his errors, but the groove of the new lineup that was keeping him sidelined. He urged his young forward to stay ready for the next series. \"After we were done,\" Steven says, \"I remember thinking, 'Man, when this guy gets back in, he's going to be a monster.'\"\n\nBrown knew everyone was watching to see how he reacted to his reduced role -- including his ever-vigilant mom -- so he channeled his disappointment into a resolve to pounce on the next opportunity.\n\n\"There was no room for any kind of negativity,\" Brown explains. \"No time for emotional temper tantrums. No one has tolerance for that, especially on a winning team.\n\n\"It would have been easy for Brad to say, 'Oh, he's going to act like that?' The next thing you know, I would have been at the end of the bench for good.\"\n\nAs he navigated this new, unfamiliar basketball role, he discovered an unlikely mentor in the very man who hijacked his minutes -- Gerald Green. The well-traveled veteran tugged at his teammate's shoulders and told him, \"You can be special. But you gotta grab that chance. It starts here. In practice.\" No more lapses, Green stressed. No more wasted possessions. And -- most of all -- no hanging your head.\n\n\"I've seen young guys break down in those situations,\" Green says. \"They're cruising along, playing great, then their minutes get funky and they fall apart. Some of them never recover.\n\n\"That didn't happen with Jaylen.\"\n\nIt couldn't. Not again. Use disappointment to make you stronger.\n\nYou can be special.\n\n\"I know Gerald thinks, 'Oh, that rookie probably doesn't remember me,' but I'll never forget what he said to me -- what he did for me,\" Brown says.\n\nThe Celtics played Washington in the second round, and Stevens gave his rookie another shot, incrementally increasing his time until Brown logged 19 critical minutes in Game 7. And when Thomas was shut down in the conference finals due to a hip injury, Brown's minutes -- and his production -- blossomed. He hasn't looked back, emerging in these young playoffs as one of the breakout stars.\n\n\"Everybody talks about development and enhancement,\" Stevens says. \"Nobody talks about rocky times and how you handle those. To me, that's a bigger launching pad.\"\n\nAs the defensive plaudits begin to trickle in, the Celtics staff keeps its budding, two-way talent grounded with data to remind Brown he still needs to sharpen his off-the-ball defensive skills. Last season, he gave up 0.85 points per chance when defending the cutter on an off-ball screen, according to ESPN Stats & Info research. This season, that number worsened slightly to 0.87 points per chance. Stevens eagerly awaits the day Brown transitions from knowing what is coming and reacting to the play to knowing what is coming and instinctively being there.\n\n\"Because of his ability,\" Stevens says, \"we hold him to a very high standard.\"\n\nThere is no higher standard than what Jaylen Brown envisions for himself.\n\n\"I'm emotionally and physically ready,\" he says, \"for anything.\"",

    "raw_text": "Deflation is the opposite of inflation; prices go down, not up, over time.\n\nAnd most economists will tell you that while excessive inflation is bad, deflation is generally really, really bad. If people think something is going to cost less next month than it does right now, they'll delay buying it. That slows down economic activity and production, the government collects less in taxes, folks get laid off because there's less spending, and everyone is worse off.\n\nOK, that's in the real world. What about in the fantasy sports entertainment world we call football?\n\nNobody likes to talk about it because the outlook can be bleak. At best, when clubs have to cut back, they whine about needing to meet Profit and Sustainability Rules ... as if they weren't the ones who had chosen to implement PSR in the first place.\n\nBut an analysis of what happened to the Premier League in the last transfer window, enhanced by conversations with club officials, owners and intermediaries, paints a fairly stark picture. After all, net spend in the world's richest league, went down by 40% and reached its lowest inflation-adjusted level of any non-COVID summer since 2014.\n\nNow, this isn't something you're necessarily going to measure in the current January transfer window, as winter transfers tend to have a \"domino effect\" anyway. Club A acquires Player X from Club B, who then spend part of the fee to replace him with Player Y from Club C, and so on. And there are some evident outliers like Manchester City, who could yet spend big since their ownership don't seem to have an evident profit motive and since their hefty profits the past couple of seasons mean they could, according to football finance blogger Swiss Ramble, lose as much as \u00a3369 million ($450m) this year and still be compliant with PSR.\n\nHowever, you could also see it in other ways. Take midfielder Adrien Rabiot, who became a free agent last summer. He just turned 29 years old, he's a 50-cap France international (starting all three group games at Euro 2024), and he has big-club experience at Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus: You would have thought he'd generate plenty of interest as a free transfer. Nope. The summer window came and went, and he only ended up finding a club (Marseille) in mid-September. And even that was for a measly two-year deal that pays him less than half what he was earning at Juventus.\n\nOr how about Victor Osimhen? Napoli wanted a fee of more than \u20ac100m for the then-25-year-old Nigeria striker (48 goals in 71 appearances the previous two seasons), eventually dropped the ask to \u20ac80m, then \u20ac60m, and still found no takers. He ended up moving to Galatasaray in Turkey, on loan, in September.\n\nIt's evident in other ways, too. Consider the league leaders in the Bundesliga (Bayern Munich) and the Premier League (Liverpool). Among Bayern's free-agents-to-be at the end of the season are Joshua Kimmich and Alphonso Davies, who are first and fourth, respectively, in league minutes played this season. Kimmich is 29, captain material and one of the best central midfielders around. Davies is 24 and one of the best left-side players. Both have been a huge part of the club's success in recent years.\n\n(Heck, while we're at it, throw in attacking midfielder Jamal Musiala. His deal isn't up until 2026, but he's 21 and arguably the best player at the club. Not that long ago, it would have been unthinkable to allow someone like that to enter the final 18 months of their contract.)\n\nAs for Liverpool, the situation involving forward Mohamed Salah (32 and the Premier League's top scorer), center back Virgil van Dijk (33 and club captain) and right back Trent Alexander-Arnold (26 and Liverpool-born and bred) is well chronicled. Talks are \"ongoing,\" everyone is \"relaxed\" (that word you always see in stories like this) and it's not affecting performance, yet nobody can remember the last time, amid such a successful campaign, that two massive, well-run, solvent clubs like Bayern and Liverpool left it so late to extend the contracts of key players.\n\nEveryone is keeping their cards close to the chest, but you can only surmise that the reason it is taking this long is that the extensions are far from straightforward. The players and their agents have a certain idea of what their services are worth, while the clubs are dealing with a new economic reality.\n\nReal Madrid insist they won't be hitting the market this January despite the fact that injuries have left them with a 33-year-old winger (Lucas V\u00e1zquez) playing right back and a 6-foot-1 central midfielder playing center back (Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni). Manchester United are trying to dump salaries (not just that of out-of-favor forward Marcus Rashford), and Manchester City are trying to move on from club captain Kyle Walker, just four months after giving him an extension through 2026.\n\nAccording to Transfermarkt, there have been 16 transfers of over \u20ac100m in history. Look at the list more closely and you'll see that more than half of them turned out to be busts or, at least, not moves clubs would do again if they could go back.\n\nThere was a time when you could roll the dice on a pricey transfer, knowing that even if you got it wrong and had to shift the player for a loss you'd still find a taker and could swallow the hit. That's not the case anymore. Look at PSG as they try to find a club to take on forward Randal Kolo Muani, whom they paid \u20ac80m to sign from Frankfurt just 18 months ago. They'll be lucky to get more than half of what they paid for him if they can ever find a permanent deal, and he's set to join Juventus on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nWhy? Partly because there just aren't that many center forward jobs out there, partly because there aren't many clubs who will spend \u20ac40m or more on a striker, but largely because the vibe has shifted. Clubs watch every penny now.\n\nThis doesn't just affect the biggest clubs, either. Those teams that relied on player trading as part of their business model -- Brighton or Brentford in England, Borussia Dortmund in Germany, Atalanta or Udinese in Italy, Monaco in France, or Sevilla in Spain -- are finding it tougher, too. You're going to be more reluctant to spend \u20ac20m or \u20ac30m on that promising young winger you spotted if you think that, once he develops, you won't get much more than that back for him.\n\nTake Dortmund's Donyell Malen. They paid \u20ac30m to acquire him from PSV Eindhoven as a 22-year-old in 2021. He didn't necessarily turn into the second coming of Lionel Messi, but he did score 15 goals as a winger last year and is a mainstay for Netherlands. Just 3\u00bd years later, he joined Aston Villa for \u20ac25m.\n\nMaybe this deflation is just a long overdue correction, one that was delayed somewhat by the wild Saudi Arabia spending two summers ago. Maybe clubs are realizing that revenue won't continue to increase the way it did. Maybe they understand that regulators -- whether UEFA, the Premier League, LaLiga (just ask Barcelona), whomever -- are serious about enforcing rules. Maybe they finally get the fact that was once billed as \"investment in the squad\" was actually some combination of ego trip and Ponzi scheme, and it actually gets really, really expensive.\n\nMaybe they simply have come to terms with the fact that transfer fees and wages have reached such levels that once revenue stops growing vertically, you can only justify them if there's a certain number of suckers and irrational actors out there to mop up your mistakes. And there are fewer and fewer of those around.\n\nMaybe we've reached some level of sanity. Maybe this will become a real, grown-up, sustainable business one day.",

    "raw_text": "Before the year is out there will be two films released with Indian wrestling at their centre, involving two of India's biggest film stars. Sultan's bout with the box office is up first in July, the film a piece of fiction, rumoured to essentially be a love story. Dangal, due for release after the Rio Olympic Games, is a biopic about Mahavir Phogat, the father who sent two wrestler-daughters to the Olympics. Any films involving the two Khans should grab everyone's attention - including India's wrestling community - well before release. This summer, though, the Khans have been upstaged.\n\nIn between Sultan and Dangal stood real life, with a subplot older, deeper and broader than what the two movies will offer, more layered than any scriptwriter could create. Like Indian wrestling or kushti itself, rising from antiquity. Spinning out memories of the great fighters of epic mythology who would butt heads and lock limbs in bouts running into hours, days, aeons.\n\nThe prelude in real life was about a dangal that was waiting to happen - and, weeks later, is still waiting. From early April or so, it was believed that Sushil Kumar and Narsingh Yadav would go mano a mano, a \"trial bout\" for the ultimate, winner-take-all prize: the 74kg-class golden ticket to Rio.\n\nHad it been a TV drama, it would have been called the Champion versus the Contender; even though it was the champion, double Olympic medalist Sushil, who contended that he deserved a trial.\n\nFrom the outside, it looks biopic material: chiaroscuro stills, slow-mo fight sequences, Eye of the Tiger music and deep booming voice-overs. Except Sushil v Narsingh is less blockbuster movie, more a novel. Nuanced and layered, hard to disentangle using mere cinematic smoke and mirrors.\n\nSushil III is not Rocky IV, the champion's last stand against some brash, trash-talking punk. This is an Indian sporting hero up against the drive and hunger of a younger man. Narsingh is 26, a year older than Sushil was in Beijing - and Rio would be his second Olympics, like Beijing 2008 was to Sushil.\n\nSushil versus Narsingh, Narsingh versus Sushil sent truths, rumours, secrets, lies and the two wrestlers themselves heading inexorably towards a potential confrontation. What took place instead, though, was frenzied activity on the margins. Social media was turned into crowd support for Sushil, superstars were mustered to take sides, the administrators were pinned in the spotlight and froze. The courts were rattled but have refused to settle into an unsolicited headlock.\n\nSushil and Narsingh belong to two different sporting generations separated by Olympic medals. The older lit a torch, the younger was inspired but bold enough to clear his throat and say, respect, thank you but we will now carry this forward, stand aside, please.\n\nIt has been an age that Indian wrestling rang any bells in India's globalised English-speaking upwardly-mobile classes. Wrestling men - large, square, thick-necked and cauliflower-eared - will chuckle at the notion and say in their rolling, rustic accents that it had never been so. Their sport and its practitioners were always considered far too rural, antediluvian.\n\nThis dilemma has knotted itself tightly around wider public imagination because it involves India's most successful Olympic athlete. Over an 18-year competitive career, Sushil Kumar has owned a sixth sense of responding to an occasion and, through it, knowing how \"bada\" (big, as the wrestlers call them) medals are won. His Olympic silver and bronze have become mile-markers in Indian sport, standards that others aspiring to athletic achievement will be measured against. In between the Beijing bronze and London silver, Sushil was also to become India's first freestyle wrestling world champion in 2010. He beat a Russian fighter Alan Gogayev in Moscow in the 66kg final, his weight category for the past 11 years.\n\nIt is the sudden vanishing of that particular category that has brought Indian wrestling to this unsavoury face-off. The 66kg lightweight was one of two weight classes dropped from the men's competition after the London Olympics to accommodate more categories for the women.\n\nSushil's new class - the 74kg welterweight - has been Narsingh's for the past ten years, starting with the 2006 Doha Asian Games. It is in this category that Narsingh won his first major medal, silver in the 2007 Commonwealth Championships, and everything that has followed since: gold in the 2010 Asian Championships and Asian and Commonwealth Games medals in 2014. And it is in this category that Narsingh the welterweight won his world championship medal in Las Vegas 2015 and earned Indian wrestling a 74kg quota or licence (to use United World Wrestling's vocabulary) for Rio.\n\nThis is the epicentre of the tremors rippling through Indian wrestling. The \"quota\" entitles that country to send only one - and only one - wrestler in that weight class to compete at the Olympics. In India, it's usually the man who wins the quota who gets to compete at the Olympics. Other countries hold trials closer to the Olympics and send the fittest and most in-form candidate in that weight category. The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) has no policy put down in black and white about quota-winners and who gets to go. Amorphous selectorial choices in the past have been dotted by low-level controversies and a court case or two.\n\n\"You can't send someone to the Olympics just by looking at his medals. If you don't compete anywhere, you want to go directly to an Olympics and say, now give me a trial, that's wrong.\" Narsingh Yadav\n\nYet nothing previously has involved an Olympic medallist, for the simple reason that, for more than half a century, Indian wrestling did not have an Olympic medallist. Sushil's medals are now making his case.\n\nThe issue is that there isn't much else to that case; certainly not a recent track record. Since switching his weight category in 2013, Sushil has competed in two events in the summer of 2014, the City of Sassari International in Italy and the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, winning silver and gold. But nothing since, not even the Pro Wrestling League. He chose not to compete at the 2015 Las Vegas world championship due to a shoulder injury, for which he had surgery, and most recently trained in Georgia, with their Olympic squad.\n\nSushil has sought a trial on the basis of what transpired before August 2014, Narsingh has stood against it because of what has followed since. He fights his corner because of where he has come from, Sushil from where he has been.\n\nThe word Sushil uses to describe what he has done - other than compete - in the months leading to Rio is tapasya. It contains spiritual and physical meanings, involving a rigorous dedication to rules as part of a devotion to a singular cause. It could even mean penance, perhaps of the athletic kind. It is an impressive, careful choice of word to represent his belief. Narsingh's description of Sushil's argument is simpler: galat. Wrong.\n\nThe Path of the Pehelwan\n\nThe two Indian wrestling films out this year come from radically opposite film-making oeuvres of the two Khans, the front-bencher, mass appeal of Salman and the higher-brow ruminations of his filmic alter-ego Aamir. Sushil and Narsingh carry no such elemental contradictions. They answer to the same ethos and share a pedigree from an unbroken line of wrestlers drawn from across the country for centuries, faithful to a common fraternity.\n\nThey belong, says Kaka Pawar, the former Indian international wrestler, like all wrestlers do, to homes far removed from affluence. Sushil's father drove a bus in Delhi for the government-run telecom company MTNL, while Narsingh's father reared cattle in a Mumbai suburb and distributed milk. Wrestling, though, formed as much a part of their environment as austerity. Their fathers and elder brothers wrestled and they were spotted as 10-11 year olds by coaches who saw the first flickers of talent: natural movement, footwork, agility, balance, hand-leg coordination. Sushil was spotted by Satpal Singh - or, as Sushil refers to him, Padamshri Mahabali Shri Satpalji; he is now Sushil's father-in-law. Narsingh remembers Bharat Yadav from a small mitti (mud) akhara in suburban Mumbai and Jagmal Singh, the Sports Authority of India coach who brought him onto the mat and competitive wrestling.\n\nTheir current situation, though, has marked them as distinctly apart. Sushil walks into a room surrounded and trailed by an entourage of around eight, confident in his own skin yet courteous, considerate, willing to share of himself. When he sits down to talk, others gather around the aura of a man who switches his address from one to many with the sweep of a measured smile. Narsingh's manner is compressed around himself. He is a little diffident, shy yet unafraid of standing up for what he says - with scattergun, low-voiced certainty and vehemence - is his, earned by right.\n\nJagmal is even pained to talk about it, \"We don't want to confront. We won't say those things to Sushil.\" He says Narsingh used to consider Sushil his idol. \"He wants to be like him and respects him a lot. Whenever anyone asks him who do you want to be like he says, 'I want to be like Sushil', but a weight category matters, doesn't it?\"\n\nNarsingh, though, is far ahead of the polite chit-chat. \"Right from the start,\" and his coach is not around to hear him say this, \"I don't compare myself to anyone. I want only to better myself and that's what I focus on. I don't think about who else is doing what, who is good and who is not. I only think that I should do better than I have done so that I can go outside the country, and win medals for my country in a big competition.\" He burns to do better in the biggest, leave the memory of London 2012 - where he lost in the first round - behind him. \"The Olympics look massive and you want to be there. When I lost in London and looked around me and saw others winning medals, I felt an emptiness. In my heart. I thought Nahin yaar, we should do better, win a medal for the country, feel good when you see your flag go up. That became a goal in my head.\"\n\nIt began with him targeting the first qualifying competition for Rio, the 2015 World Championships in Las Vegas. \" I thought if I could make Olympic qualification right there, I'd get time to prepare for Rio, then I can go there and get a gold.\"\n\nIt is Sushil whose medals have given Indian wrestlers, Narsingh included, such breadth of desire. Former wrestling international Jagdish Kaliraman, an older teammate when Sushil made his world championship debut in New York in 2003, says, \"At that time, we never thought we could win a medal at the Olympics. India was not used to our sportsmen winning Olympic medals . It was a dream, we wondered how we could possibly accomplish that.\"\n\n\"You practice that, you train over and over again. Even when you're having a meal, it's on your mind. You close your eyes and you think about it, see it being done.\" Sushil Kumar\n\nSushil and Yogeshwar Dutt, the London Olympics bronze-medal winning poetry-writing featherweight, have unlocked an invisible door. \"The entire scenario has changed over the last ten years,\" says Kaliraman, now a coach. \"People's thinking has changed, they are now very caring and have a different attitude towards wrestlers and other sportsmen also. It's come from the medals.\"\n\nWhat has also changed in India is the understanding that an Olympic medal is not an elusive yearning but a tangible project. \"You need a team of five, six ten people for someone to win a medal at the Asian Games or the Olympics. It's teamwork now, not a single person's journey from a village to an Olympic medal. That romantic story is over.\"\n\nMaybe the tapasya that Sushil was referring to was not a hermit's solitary penance of self-denial, but the unshakeable rigour, control and discipline over wrestling's sciences and arts, with every tool of the trade at his disposal.\n\nIn their formative years in kushti, what the greatest wrestlers absorb is a tunnel vision of purpose. In the training hall of the Sports Authority of India's northern regional centre in Sonepat, there is a small shrine to the wrestlers' god Hanuman. When every fighter walks in to morning training, he first heads to the shrine, bows to Hanuman, mutters a small prayer and only then lace up his shoes and stretch his spine. It is the path of the pehelwan: Hanuman-worship, vegetarianism, the celibate life to which the weary urban watcher will roll their eyes. The strength of such faith exists beyond the realm of our understanding, but it remains instantly recognisable.\n\nAsk Sushil what he thought about being in New York, the global capital, as a young wrestler in 2003 and he says the city didn't hold his attention. \"The first time I travelled outside the country was to Manchester in the junior worlds. My final bout was against a Polish wrestler who was a defending champion. I didn't think who I was competing against, or where I was. My only thought was if I trained well, I would get a good result.\" He was to defeat Krystian Brzozowski and win the 45kg world cadet title.\n\nIn New York, at his first senior worlds he finished fourth, losing to the eventual world champion Arif Abdullaev by a single point, a performance that, Kaliraman said, astonished his teammates. \"The Indian squad lost most of their bouts, but Sushil stood out. As seniors we realised this was a wrestler to take seriously, because he had shown ability.\"\n\nTwelve years later Narsingh was to find himself in another world championship with Olympic qualification in sight. It was in Las Vegas, a city built around bright lights and loose cash, but all Narsingh saw in the distance was Rio. \"The Olympics feel different, it is bigger than even the world championships. That's why everyone wants it. Everyone turns up from everywhere, having trained like crazy, to the maximum and wants to win at any cost. It is a very high level of competition.\"\n\nThe Olympics, Narsingh says, has the power to be the \"turning point\" in his life. \"Win a medal there and your life changes.\" As it did for Sushil, whose shadow now sits over the shoulder of every Indian wrestler who will go to Rio.\n\nThe Weight of a Shadow\n\nNever mind the shadow, Narsingh today can't shake off the real thing. At the SAI's Northern Regional Centre in Sonepat, just outside Delhi, he trains every morning in the Sushil Kumar-Yogeshwar Dutt Hall. As he lines up to do \"warm-up\" exercises that would make other athletes go pale - including cartwheels and forward and backward somersault - Sushil's photographs with his medals and his moves stare down at him the walls around the six training mats.\n\nToday, getting to the community dining hall means going past a small but carefully landscaped garden, called the Sushil Kumar Udyan (park). In the days before fame, Sushil would take a breather between training and meals, sitting on a broken bench overlooking what used to be a dumpyard. The dumpyard is now manicured, saplings growing into trees that offer shade to rest and day-dream.\n\nThere was a time that Narsingh and Sushil joked, sparred and enjoyed the normal equation of stalwart and aspirant. Narsingh knew that while Sushil shared the gym with the other wrestlers, he was entitled to having his own training hall created above the main administrative block. He is entitled to anything, in fact, but his quota place.\n\nNarsingh doesn't seem overawed by Sushil's omnipresence. Take the simple fact of how he addresses Sushil. Young wrestlers call each other bhaiya (brother), seniors are referred to by the third-person suffix \"pehelwan\" and the highest form of respect is Pehelwanji. In Sonepat, there are only two \"Pehelwanjis\" - Yogeshwar and Sushil.\n\nSo Narsingh isn't big on the honorifics. \"I accept that Sushil is a very big name, that is fine, he has won a lot. But you can't send someone to the Olympics just by looking at his medals. It is a question of performance - I'm the one went to the world championship, won a medal and qualified for the Olympics. That's the first time it has happened... If you don't compete anywhere, you want to go directly to an Olympics and say, now give me a trial, that's wrong. \" Sushil has heard this before and smiles his man-of-the-people smile, making his point with a subtle but cutting lightness. He speaks as though he is sparring with a junior, toying with him, setting him up for the kill. \"I have this habit,\" he starts off, \"that I give my juniors many, many chances. Who knows, I could have competed in the World Championships after the Commonwealth Games, and not given a chance (to youngsters like Narsingh).\"\n\nHe then lists the names of many Indians going to Rio who have had to go through trials - shooter and Beijing gold medallist Abhinav Bindra and archer Deepika Kumari are the most promiment. \"The best from India, have to show their performance again and say that yes, I am ready for the Olympics. And that person is the one who goes to the Games.\"\n\nThen he swoops in. He talks about his bouts against Narsingh, claiming there have been two (ESPN was unable to verify this and Narsingh's camp says they have faced each other only once, ten years ago). \"I've beaten him both times, one was in a national wrestling competition about three-four years ago. Then once was when I was in the 66kgs category and he went to 84kg. So I competed in one tournament in the 84kg category, I had to compete seeing the set-up of my team so I beat him in that as well.\"\n\nOnce again, it is Sushil's past career that makes the argument.\n\nThe Economy of Effective Movement\n\nWhen studying young wrestlers, coaches look for presence of mind, foot speed and adaptability. Of the wrestler's ability to work within a zero radius area through his stance. As Kaliraman describes it, \"to make his body bigger or smaller.\" To crouch low and further away from the reach of a bigger opponent or to quickly transfer his weight in his stance and stand taller against someone small. It is not so much a visual trick as it is a tactical option of changing positions over a very short period of time in a small physical space. Of either looking smaller to dodge or bigger to block.\n\nIt is what happened to both Sushil and Narsingh when the rumour of their impending trial went from a growing grumble to full-on verbal sparring. Pushed into a corner created by the sum of his circumstances, Sushil drew himself to the height of his achievement. Buffeted by the tides but secure in his arguments, Narsingh stayed low, remained forceful and didn't lose ground. These were stylistically varied but equally dangerous competitors.\n\nKushti contains rich lore and mythology, starting with lyrical metaphors for a wrestler's stance (the paintra) which then morphs and choreographs into moves (daon/ daav), counter-moves (pench) and saves/defence (kaat/ todh). Joseph Alter's pioneering book The Wrestler's Body speaks of the north Indian wrestler in his traditional mitti/ mud akhara, when he says, \"The art of wrestling is to achieve an economy of effective motion.\" It still holds on the Olympic mat but must be accompanied by speed. \"Freestyle wrestling is very simple,\" Kaliraman says. \"You have to score points and to do so, you have to get hold of the other guys's legs and see that he doesn't get hold of yours. Freestyle wrestling starts and ends there.\"\n\nNarsingh's coach Jagmal Singh hasn't counted the number of daavs or pench - there are more than 500, some say - but believes that there must be more technical variations in wrestling than in any other sport. Kaka Pawar, now a Pune-based coach, says, \"Every wrestler has one move/ daav with thousands of variations/ todh. That one move becomes the wrestler's fundamental, singular piece of choreography, which, when pulled off at the right time, cannot be countered.\"\n\nSushil and Narsingh have their own, which takes their personalities and flips them over. Sushil is a prowler seeking openings, probing doubts and weaknesses while waiting for his moment. His semi-final in the 2012 London Olympics is a demonstration of his skill, thinking and ability to lock onto his mastermove. It is called the Irani daav or the Iktangi (one leg), a ground move where the attacker pins his opponent underneath him, locks back one of his opponent's legs with his own and exerts increasing pressure on his lower back and neck.\n\nIn London, Sushil trailed Kazakhstan's Akzhurek Tanatarov 0-3, with a little over a minute of the final round left. He pushed forward and took Tanatarov down; in the brief moment as Tanatarov twisted himself off his back, Sushil snapped Tanatarov's right leg back into the jaws of his double knee-hold. The Kazakh's body was under pressure, he claimed he had been bitten, \"grazed\" said the Indians, but the points spun towards Sushil's attack which led to the Kazakh being lifted off the ground and Sushil earning a place in an Olympic final.\n\nSushil says, \"You practice that, you train over and over again. That move - getting to it - is in your mind all the time. Even when you're having a meal, it's on your mind. You close your eyes and you think about it, see it being done. See it being done correctly, and how many combinations of moves you need to get to that point. Correctly. That is the kind of training you get into.\"\n\nNarsingh is a counter attacker, a creature of swift surprise - like he demonstrated against Zelimkhan Khadijev of France during his bronze medal bout at the World Championships in Las Vegas that won India the 74kg quota for Rio. It is called a dhaak and he pulled it off when deep in a hole, trailing 4-12 with less than a minute left of his quarter-final bout. The YouTube video shows the two in a countdown impasse of sorts, arms gripped, short bursts of movement. Khadijev keeps moving backwards for 15 seconds. Then in, the blink of an eye, Narsingh feints and drops low on his inside. Khadijev is then rolled over on Narsingh's side, legs in the air, and shoulders hitting the ground, staying pinned. In all of four seconds, Narsingh went from 4-12 down and into the world championship semi-final with a quota slot in Rio.\n\nNarsingh remembers that moment. \"You're tired but you have to be in the present, have the presence of mind. Use the correct technique at the correct time. Only then do you get the points you need... The points lead was huge - in my mind, I knew that I could only win with a direct fall.\" He describes the last 20 seconds: \"The French wrestler was backing away a lot - and if I kept pushing him, he would keep going which wouldn't be of use to me. I stayed in my position, which gave him the impression I'd given up and he sort of relaxed.\" It is when he pulled off what coach Jagmal Singh, who began working with him 16 years ago, his \"do or die move.\" Pawar says he has another signature move, the bagal doob, in which he switches from arms gripped together into a dipping feint under the rival's arm, ending up at his opponent's back, locking down the opponent's freedom of movement by grabbing him from behind.\n\nJagmal says that the dhaak is quintessentially a move from kushti but not so much in Olympic competition. \"It's very much a part of our wrestling - you will see a lot of the dhaak in the dangals but not much at the Olympic level because no one comes that close... we practice it all the same because this is the do or die. Had Narsingh's arm slipped at the world championship he could've ended up below his opponent and lost points. He pulled it off perfectly.\"\n\nThe Hunger of a Heritage\n\nIn Sushil's and Narsingh's entanglements lies the story of the shifting powercentres of wrestling in independent India. On the one hand the centrifugal force that pulls in fighters from around the National Capital Region and rural Haryana, in akharas and more modern schools, and on the other the state of Maharashtra's own wrestling pedigree - with its roots in its old royalty, new money and a pride that is both encrusted and simmering.\n\nWrestling historian Ashokrao Jadhav from Talegaon in Maharashtra recounts that state's heritage. Two wrestlers from here - featherweight Dinkar Shinde and middleweight KP Nawale - were part of the first Indian team to the Olympics, in Antwerp 1920. And who could forget that India's first individual Olympic medallist, Khashaba Dadasaheb Jadhav, was a wrestler from Maharashtra? From Goleshwar village, in Satara district, where they welcomed him home from Helsinki in 1952 with a procession of 151 bullock carts. Wrestling blogger Milind Manugade remembers his guru's words. \"He looked at us and said every student in front of him was the great grandson of a wrestler. Wrestling was alive in every household in our state.\"\n\n\"Ten years ago, Sushil could have been Narsingh setting out with the mission of trying to change his life. Ten years from now, Narsingh could be Sushil all over again.\"\n\nKaka Pawar is quick to accept that the Olympic medals earned by Sushil and Dutt have led to a growing number of students turning up at his coaching school in Katraj, outside Pune. \"We have wrestlers in house but more of the talent is in Haryana... there is a great environment there. Every parent and child seems to want to turn to wrestling for better lives, livelihood.\"\n\nBut they will not stand for their boy Narsingh Yadav - so what if he was born in Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, his wrestler father Pancham one of thousands of economic migrants to Mumbai -being blindsided and short changed. They've already seen it happen to Rahul Aware, another Olympic contender, the son of farmers from Beed, in the dry heart of the state. Aware missed out on Olympic contention in the 57kg category, finishing third in the Asian Olympic qualification competition held in Kazakhstan in March 2016. Only the two finalists got in. Aware then had two more qualification tournaments over the next months, in Mongolia where the top three would qualify and Istanbul (finalists only). Rather than get another chance, Aware was sidelined, his closest rival and national 57kg champ Sandeep Tomar chosen to head out to Mongolia and have a go at an easier qualification event. Tomar grabbed his chance and qualified through Mongolia. Here again, were two wrestlers clashing over one weight; the national 61kg champ Aware scaling down to the Olympic 57kg, Tomar, earlier a 55kg wrestler moved up to 57kgs in January 2014.\n\nThe shenanigans have left Pawar angry. \"What can Aware do now? The man who beat everyone in your own trials, you left him out. He defeated Tomar in the Pro Wrestling competition and can defeat Tomar today and tomorrow. When India has a chance to get a medal, these politicians do such things. There is politics behind every post in our sports administration. Indian sport needs to free these positions of the politicians. Then our kids can win every medal in every sport.\"\n\nShould the Wrestling Federation of India give Sushil a trial going by his previous record, Aware could easily demand one too. Manugade says, \"For the last 25 years, the WFI has been in control of the Delhi-UP wallahs. What will someone like Aware do? Or Narsingh. They think, I am still young I have age on my side, why should I mess with them? They'll punish me, get me caught for doping, ban me for three of your years. So our boys from Maharashtra keep quiet.\"\n\nBut these two \"lobbies\" also live a double-helixed life, the historian Jadhav reveals. In the early 20th century, dozens of wrestlers would travel down to the princely state of Kolhapur, a stronghold of pre-independence Indian wrestling. The languages intermingled - Maharashtra's wrestling vocabulary refers to a wrestling competition not as a dangal, but an akhara. It is the word which, in the north, unequivocally refers to a wrestling school. A wrestling school in Maharashtra is called a \"talim,\" an Urdu or Persian word for education. Like the two wrestling kingdoms they represent, it is no wonder Sushil and Narsingh are not easily separated.\n\n*****\n\nThere are several dispassionate ways to deal with this dilemma - by citing the rule book that the WFI dips into now and then, studying the competition in the 74kg class and understanding that no matter who goes to Rio, a medal is not a given. The tumult around the trial must carry its consequences. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius would recognise Sushil v Narsingh as inevitable. \"The art of true living in this world,\" he is known to have said around 1800 years ago, \"is more like a wrestler's than a dancer's.\"\n\nAnother way of sorting out the jumble of Sushil and Narsingh is to look at them not as two wrestlers, but one going through varying stages of a career. Ten years ago, Sushil could have been Narsingh setting out with the mission of trying to change his life. Ten years from now, Narsingh could be Sushil all over again. A great fighter with an ageing body but sharper in his mind than he has ever been, making a tiny but perhaps fatal miscalculation.\n\nWhat if Sushil had gambled with Las Vegas? After all, Yogeshwar made the trip despite an injury scare. He didn't get past the medical exam but qualified for Rio in the next tournament. In Vegas, Narsingh stepped in to fill the vacuum left by Sushil's absence and today will not concede an inch. Sushil is today pitched into middle of a wrestling bout being played out in slow motion.\n\nWhen discussing their trade, fighters tend to be full of parables, they talk about how wrestling is all about experience. About the quality of decisions taken when leading or trailing. It is not that moves/ daavs that are successful in themselves; it is their timing that makes them so. Yogeshwar offers this: \"Lage daav ki koi kaat nahin.\" There is no save against a successful, well-timed move. Make that move a micro-second late? Yogeshwar laughs and says, \"har daav ki kaat hai.\" Every move can be blocked. This was the only way the story had to go.\n\nThe ambitions of Sushil and the dreams of Narsingh. This wasn't about their common ground, the sport to which either man is deeply committed. It was about the 1m ring that marks the dead centre of a wrestling mat, its heart which two men may crouch around but only one can stand over. Both men wanted it. They are wrestlers. They couldn't have dealt with this in any other way.",

    "raw_text": "Across the Olympics, the Paralympics and the Chess World Championship there was glory and tragedy and sporting nirvana and more than its fair share of drama for Indian sport this year. We attempt to capture, and herald, the best of 2024.\n\nHere are ESPN India's Awards (and Moments), 2024:\n\nAthlete of the Year, Male\n\nD Gukesh and his 16 chess pieces take over the world\n\n2024's pick was unanimous once again, but this time it's for an unassuming, humble 18-year-old boy who was barely on anyone's radar at the start of the year. -- Sunaadh Sagar\n\nAthlete of the Year, Female\n\nManu Bhaker moulds herself anew to be cast in unbreakable bronze\n\nIt would have been understandable if Manu Bhaker had crumbled. Over the past three years, after the debacle of Tokyo, after a striking realisation, during the fortnight that granted her immortality. But she didn't -- Anirudh Menon\n\nPara Athlete of the Year, Male\n\nHarvinder 'Clutch' Singh flipped the script and made history\n\nUntil 2024, he was India's only medallist in archery at either the Olympics or the Paralympics. In 2024, Harvinder Singh went one better. He became India's only gold medallist in archery at either the Olympic or the Paralympics. It was a stunning display from Harvinder for his second Paralympic medal, as right through the competition, he stood head and shoulders above the rest of the field -- Aaditya Narayan\n\nPara Athlete of the Year, Female\n\nAvani Lekhara's unprecedented gold defence seals her legend\n\nIf Tokyo 2021 was the birth of a star, then Paris 2024 was the Games that sealed the legend that is Avani Lekhara. Before this bespectacled, 22-year-old girl in a wheelchair, no Indian had defended an Olympic or Paralympic gold. In Paris, she came, she saw, and she conquered. Again. - Zenia D'cunha\n\nTeam(s) of the Year\n\nIndian chess announces itself with never-seen-before dominance of Olympiad\n\nAt the 45th FIDE Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Indian chess announced itself in a manner never seen before -- it was pure collective domination. In the Open section, India was represented by Dommaraju Gukesh, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, Arjun Erigaisi, Vidit Gujrathi, and Harikrishna Pentala (Srinath Narayanan was captain). In the women it was Harika Dronavalli, Vaishali Rambabu, Divya Deshmukh, Vantika Agrawal, and Tania Sachdev (Abhijit Kunte was captain). And they swept all in front of them. -- Anirudh Menon\n\nCoach of the Year\n\nCraig Fulton, the 'friend' whose 'clear vision' guided Team India to Olympic bronze\n\nAt one point in the Paris Olympics, it looked like the Indian men's hockey team had no chance to better (or retain) the medal they had won at Tokyo. But under the leadership of Craig Fulton, a coach with a distinctly un-Indian style of play, a coach many had doubts about after months of failure, they did just that. -- Anish Anand (with Harmanpreet Singh)\n\nMatch of the Year\n\nVinesh Phogat pulls of un-scriptable win against undefeated champion\n\nThe best kind of sport often comes with a disclaimer: \"even scriptwriters couldn't have thought this up.\" At the Paris Olympics, we saw a textbook example of this, of David vs Goliath, and David bringing down the undefeated giant through sheer determination and smart tactics. So how would it look if we turned Vinesh Phogat vs Yui Susaki into a script? - Zenia D'Cunha\n\nEmerging Athletes of the Year\n\nMona Agarwal, Anmol Kharb, Divya Deshmukh shine bright in 2024\n\nIn an Olympic and Paralympic year, it's only natural that there are a few athletes - previously unheralded - who come up through the rank and catapult themselves into the spotlight. It's perhaps the most exciting thing as a sports fan, seeing someone new come up on to the international stage, and right away, make a statement that they belong. - Aaditya Narayan\n\nMOMENTS OF THE YEAR\n\nAs a remarkable 2024 draws to end, ESPN India picks ten images, moments, stories that tell the tale of the most extraordinary Indian sports moments witnessed over the year.\n\nWith 8 medals in a day, Indian sport lives its greatest day at the Paralympics\n\nThat's right, 8 medals on a single day. A sum of 2 golds, 3 silvers, 3 bronzes. In just one day, India had won as many medals as they had across all Paralympic Games between 1988 and 2016. One day's haul = 28 years' tally. Incredibly, these were 8 medals won out of a just 14 medal chances -- Zenia D'Cunha\n\nSumit Antil's anger at not shattering own world record brings another record Paralympics gold\n\nIn Paris this summer, there were two Indians looking to defend their javelin gold. Only one did... and it's the manner in which he did it that makes Sumit Antil so special. -- Anirudh Menon\n\nAmit Saroha's pride and happiness in protege Dharambir's gold\n\nHow often do you see celebrations at an international sports event where the athlete who finished 10th is perhaps the happiest of the lot? One such example unfolded after the men's club throw F51 final at the Paris Paralympics. It was India 1-2, with Dharambir winning gold, and Pranav Soorma taking silver. However, the most beaming smile at the Stade de France belonged to Amit Saroha. -- Aaditya Narayan.\n\nSheetal, Rakesh bask in glory of deserved medal after near-misses\n\nThe moment right after Sheetal Devi and Rakesh Kumar won the Paralmypics bronze medal told a story of relief. Sheetal was standing up, in tears and taking in the applause while Rakesh, on his wheelchair, was equal parts happy and relieved. -- Anish Anand\n\nNeeraj becomes human after Nadeem's divine throw\n\nOn the biggest night of all, what would have been his crowning glory as one of the Olympic greats in his sport, Neeraj's friend across the border had upstaged him. -- Sunaadh Sagar\n\nThe gut-punch of Vinesh Phogat's Olympic disqualification\n\nYou remember the feeling. You may not want to, but you do. On the morning of August 7, 2024, you, the Indian sports fan, woke up with a light heart and a bounce in your step. -- Anirudh Menon\n\nPR Sreejesh saves India, yet again\n\nIt was his last tournament wearing India colours. As it so often had in his career before, India's progression boiled down to PR Sreejesh in goal. -- Aaditya Narayan\n\nGukesh's tears lay bare the magnitude in the mundane\n\nDommaraju Gukesh always rearranges the chess pieces back on his side of the board after every game ends. It's a matter of routine for him: win, loss, tie... before he gets up from the board, he needs to have arranged those pieces back in their proper places. Except on December 12, 2024, there was something different about this most mundane practice of his. -- Anirudh Menon\n\nSwapnil Kusale's nearly forgotten bronze that deserves eternal celebration\n\nKusale's bronze medal was an important milestone - India's first in the long-form format of 50m 3P; won by an unassuming, 28-year-old, an age almost considered too old in Indian shooting circles, and that too completing a personal redemption arc after one lapse in focus cost him an Asian Games gold. -- Zenia D'Cunha\n\nA tearful end to Sunil Chhetri's career that deserved more\n\nIt felt like a personal failure. Not for Sunil Chhetri, not after 19 glorious years and 94 goals for India. But for his teammates, his adoring fans that together idolized him their whole lives, it was a bittersweet end to a career that deserved more. -- Sunaadh Sagar",

    "raw_text": "After eight matches played across four months, we finally know the 24 teams that will continue in the new UEFA Champions League format through to the knockout rounds.\n\nIt's been a big departure from the old way, with those eight four-team groups having become like a trusted old friend over more than 20 years.\n\nTop-level football in Europe had never seen anything like this before: 36 teams in one massive league table, playing only eight opponents and not on a mirrored home-and-away basis.\n\nBut has it delivered a better competition? Our writers assess its impact.\n\nDid you love or hate the new-look Champions League?\n\nGabriele Marcotti: I thought it was really good. Maybe in a few years the novelty wears off and we'll hate it. But for now, I really enjoyed it. I like the fact that smaller teams actually have winnable games. And we have more games among big teams. I think it's silly to call it \"a slog\" (Is the Premier League \"a slog\"?) or to say all those big-budget clubs who didn't make the top eight mailed it in (how about some credit to those who beat them?). As for the jeopardy aspect, we won't really know until we know how the seeds play out in the sense that it's not clear now that being 20th is much worse than being 13th.\n\nMark Ogden: It's been great on Matchday 7 and 8, but that's the problem -- it shouldn't have taken so long to become exciting. The early matchdays lacked intensity and jeopardy because the bigger clubs were coasting. The likes of Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich all made the mistake of thinking they could take it easy and cruise through, but they won't repeat that mis-judgement next season. Credit to Celtic, Feyenoord and Aston Villa, though, for taking it seriously from day one. Qualification was their reward.\n\nJames Olley: It's a money grab by UEFA that diluted the group stage jeopardy to the point it was hard to know what any of it really meant until near the end. That obviously made for a more uncertain climax, and the idea of having all final-round matches kick off at the same time is a good one, but those positives were outweighed by two extra matches making this stage a painfully slow burner, which ultimately contributes to widespread and valid concerns about player welfare.\n\nRob Dawson: Personally, I am not a fan. There's nothing wrong with trying to revamp the format, but I'm not sure adding loads more games was the answer. More statement matches are welcome because fans want to see Manchester City against Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool against Real Madrid. The flip side, though, has been a gruelling league phase with lots of meaningless games and very little jeopardy. The excitement around all the final league phase games kicking off at the same time is one positive. It's just a shame there wasn't more at stake to make it a really blockbuster night.\n\nBeth Lindop: The new format has been a little bit of a slog, with even players and managers admitting to being unsure of the permutations of various results. That said, I think the Champions League was in need of a shake-up, and there have been some more exciting matchups thanks to the new format, even if the level of jeopardy going into the final night was perhaps not as high as it might have been.\n\nDale Johnson: It's still early days, but I reckon it's fair to say it's only the bigger clubs that didn't really enjoy the slog. For a lot of the clubs it has been a joy to experience a successful campaign in the Champions League, rather than simply expect to finish bottom of a four-team group with your European adventure over before Christmas. A lot of supporters didn't really understand what was going on this season, and they're still confused now by the knockout bracket ahead of Friday's draw. But like all competitions, fans will come to know how it works and how important positions can be amid the drama of the final round of fixtures.\n\nDid you prefer the new format to the old?\n\nJohnson: For all the comments of a slog made up of meaningless games, people maybe forget how much of a ceremonial formality most of the four-team groups were. Most were effectively done and dusted by the time Matchday 4 kicked off. And by Matchday 6, you might have only a couple of positions in a couple of groups with real jeopardy. The old format had just as many, if not more, pointless matches, they were just hidden a little. At least this format has a final day where almost every match matters. That said, I think \"more big games\" is a false argument, as they are quite ceremonial due to the long nature of the league phase -- ergo, what does one win really mean? And it's definitely a good thing there's now no safety net to drop into the Europa League.\n\nOlley: No. The old format wasn't ideal, but don't let the pursuit of the perfect be the enemy of the good. UEFA is keen to point out the roller-coaster nature of the league table, but it is ridiculous that a team like Manchester City, for example, can still be in the competition after the campaign they've had. Only two of Wednesday night's matches had no bearing on qualification, which, taken in isolation, is an obvious selling point for this format, but the price was too high: weeks of matches with minimal risk is not worth the one-night payoff.\n\nMarcotti: One hundred percent. If you're a top seed, in the old format, you might stomp a bottom seed, win and lose against the third seed and -- presto! -- you have nine points and all you need is one point from two games against the second seed. That's not exciting. Also, with the old format, the focus in each nation used to be on whatever groups had teams from that country in it. Now, it's more spread out. You see more teams. It feels more like a league. Not to mention the seeding pots give you less of an advantage than they did before. And that's a good thing.\n\nOgden: No, because there are too many games that feel like they don't matter and it enables clubs to qualify by doing the bare minimum. I accept we are never going back to the jeopardy of knockout games from the first round, or when we had mega groups such as Bayern, Barcelona and Manchester United in the same four-team group in 1998-99, but the new format was sadly a non-event until January.\n\nDawson: Not particularly. The general principal of the new format -- having more big teams playing each other -- is the right idea. You wouldn't have had top seeds playing each other this early in the old format and they're the games that generate the most excitement. The problem is that to increase the number quality of matches without significantly expanding the schedule, you have to reduce the number of participants. UEFA is never going to do that because it means fewer games and less money. Regardless of whether UEFA wants to admit it, the driving force behind the switch in format was the increased revenue.\n\nLindop: I do think the old format had become a little bit tired. There are definite drawbacks to the new format, chiefly that teams who have performed poorly in the league phase have been able to seal a place in the top 24 relatively comfortably. However, the group stage always felt like something of a formality for many of the top clubs, so I'm not convinced that was a better model.\n\nWho have been the biggest winners and losers of the new format?\n\nOgden: The biggest winners have been the clubs because they have made a lot more money from the format and that, ultimately, was the reason for the change. On a less cynical note, it's been good for the teams that struggled to get out of the old group stage, such as Celtic, but it wasn't designed for the mid-ranking teams to have more fun. The biggest losers? Probably the fans who have to pay for more games, most of which felt insignificant in the early stages.\n\nMarcotti: Damn, Ogden is grumpy. Fans don't \"have to pay more\" for more games, Mark. They can choose to pay more to watch the team they love two more times. Or they can choose not to. It certainly feels like midsized and smaller clubs have more of a shot than they did under the old format. And, of course, we have more knockout football. Which is what the traditionalists want, right?\n\nJohnson: Let's take a look at Pot 4 of this year's draw. Three teams -- Aston Villa, Brest and AS Monaco -- have made it through to the UCL knockouts. Under the old format, only three teams made it in the last four editions. But this isn't only about progress, it's about being competitive too. Look at Celtic, who won one match in 12 in the last two editions and finished bottom of their group. This year, they won two of their first four matches. Sort of like the UEFA Nations League, giving teams more matches against teams of their own level (Pot 3 and 4) increases general competitiveness. Lille and Aston Villa are straight through to the round of 16, which would have been extremely difficult before, while the likes of Brest and AS Monaco were able to be competitive to the very last matchday.\n\nThe losers? Definitely those big clubs who missed out on the top eight and must now play two extra matches. Under the old format, with the round of 16 spread across four weeks, all UCL teams would get two midweeks of rest. But with the new knockout playoff round, AC Milan, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Man City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid have to play all four midweeks. Let's see how they approach the league phase next season.\n\nOlley: One interesting losing group from this format is the club analysts. One high-placed source rightly pointed out to me a couple of months ago that the analysts' workload has almost tripled, because instead of working on three group stage opponents, they now face eight. That may have been a contributing factor in the number of upsets and high-scoring games in the group stage.\n\nDawson: Manchester City are the biggest winners. They've won three games in the Champions League against Sparta Prague, Slovan Bratislava and Club Brugge and still qualified for the next round. Slovan Bratislava finished 35th in the table, Sparta Prague finished 31st and Club Brugge scraped into the playoffs by finishing 24th. The way City played in the competition, they probably deserve to be out. But UEFA has built in a safety net for the big clubs with the sheer volume of games, and City managed to save themselves at the crucial moment.\n\nLindop: In terms of winners, it's nice to see some clubs that previously struggled to get out of the group stage, like Celtic and Feyenoord, have a chance to get through to the round of 16. For Champions League debutants Brest, too, the new format will surely be viewed as a big success. The biggest losers are probably the players, many of whom have had to play two extra games for very little payoff.\n\nWhat would you change to make it better?\n\nMarcotti: I think the only people who like what I'm about to say are me and Theo Theodoridis, the UEFA general secretary. But if we want to make the seeds really relevant, we should let the top seed pick whatever opponent they like (and whether they want to play home or away first.) Second seed gets next pick and so on. Not only would it enhance the narrative, but it would also avoid freak situations where a team does well and then get stuck playing Manchester City or someone like that who happen to have underachieved and drawn a lower seed.\n\nLindop: The playoff concept could yet yield some interesting matchups, but the fact a team could finish 24th and end up qualifying for the round of 16 at the expense of one that finished ninth doesn't sit quite right. It won't happen but I would prefer it if the top 16 just went through automatically.\n\nOgden: Maybe find a way to cram all the games into the calendar before Christmas so that it gives the competition more momentum. I know that will cause havoc for some countries with too many games and cup competitions -- hello, England! -- but by making it more intense, it would help grab the attention better. The knockout stage looks great, so the tennis-draw model has worked, but it's the journey before that which needs a tweak.\n\nOlley: Reduce the group stage to 24 teams. Then, top eight go through, middle eight face a playoff and bottom eight are relegated. More jeopardy, higher quality, better product. Except of course that will never happen because the television revenue from more matches is too great to pass up. Which is the entire point of the change.\n\nDawson: The number of teams should be reduced and all the league-phase games played before Christmas. Matchday 8 was an exciting night, but it took too long to get there. It has felt like the Champions League has ambled along for months only to speed up at the last minute. The problem is that if it's money UEFA is after, then it is going to want more and more games. That dilutes the product and serves up just as many poor games as good ones.",

    "raw_text": "IN A CLEARING on a grassy hillside near a two-lane highway in eastern Pennsylvania lie the bones of Jim Thorpe, the man considered by many to be the world's greatest athlete. Fashioned of polished stone the color of red riverbank mud, his tomb is oblong and almost 6 feet tall. A truck rumbles past, then another. The rustle of wind blows low across the glade and through a line of trees. Few people stop to pay respect to this legendary Native American.\n\nThe crypt is at the edge of a small town Thorpe was never known to visit, a place with which he had no known connection. The community, Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, took his name to claim his body, and its residents think their town has won a decades long battle to keep his remains as a tourist destination. Thorpe's sons, the last of his living children, think his spirit wanders the earth in sorrow because he has never had a proper ceremony for the dead. They say they will fight for his remains until they can return him to his original home in Oklahoma.\n\nONE THOUSAND four hundred eighty-two miles southwest of Thorpe's grave, his son Richard walks slowly through the living room of his small home, tucked off a narrow, gravel road near Waurika, in the stillness of southern Oklahoma. Richard Thorpe is 83, thin and halting. His grip is weak. His voice is low and rounded, as if his words are flowing over pebbles stuck in his throat. For 63 years, he says, the spirit of his father, Wa-tho-huck, \"light after the lightning,\" has been wandering the earth without peace. Richard Thorpe and his brother, Bill, who is 87, want to bring him back to these dusty hills and give him a proper burial where he wanted to be: with his family, where he was born.\n\n\"He lives with me each day from the moment I wake,\" Richard says, motioning toward one wall of his cream-colored living room. He stares through thick eyeglasses at a photo of himself and his father, taken in black and white in the mid-1930s. Richard was a bashful boy at the time, standing on a front porch, wearing a Native American headdress. The wide hand of his father lies across one of his narrow shoulders. Richard Thorpe struggles to speak; not long ago, he suffered a stroke. \"To everyone else, he was this famous man. He'd walk into a room, and everyone would turn and look,\" he says. \"To us, he was Dad. Just plain Dad.\"\n\nOn other walls in the room are more images: paintings and lithographs of Jim Thorpe, with his rugged face, his wide neck and his quick, sinewy muscles. He is motionless, yet full of energy, as he plays college football in the thick woolen uniform worn at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, as he races down a track at the 1912 Olympics and as he gets ready to bat for the New York Giants. On a bookshelf in Richard's living room are medals and statues, each inscribed with the name Jim Thorpe.\n\nMore Olympics\n\nComplete Olympics coverage \u00bb\n\nOne hundred twenty-five miles farther south, Richard's brother Bill sits in his living room in Arlington, Texas, also surrounded by paintings and photographs of their celebrated father. Bill, a former parts-supply supervisor in the aeronautics industry, and Richard, a retired purchasing agent for the state of Oklahoma, share Jim Thorpe's flinty eyes, his determined jaw and his sturdy shoulders. The sons are not given to emotion, but when they speak of their father's soul, they are stricken, particularly when they recount a cold spring night in April of 1953, which still has the sharp sting of a fresh wound. That was the night their father's body was snatched away during his funeral.\n\n\"Time is getting short,\" Bill says, speaking about himself and his brother. They want to be alive to see their father come home. If they hope to win the battle for his bones, they must do it now. \"His spirit isn't rested,\" Richard says. He forces the words to come. \"The people of his tribe never finished the burial the way it must be done. He was taken from us. We never finished.\"\n\nIN THE LOW, rolling hills just outside Shawnee, Oklahoma, a bulky, dark casket lay on a blanket-covered bench in the middle of a ceremonial hut covered with canvas. Inside the coffin was Jim Thorpe, his head pointed to the west, where the spirits of the properly buried go to live.\n\nUnder his wire-rimmed glasses, blue paint swirled around his eyes. He was dressed in a buckskin jacket and leather moccasins. \"He had beadwork draped around his shoulders,\" Bill Thorpe says. He clutched tobacco that had been blessed by the tribe. Next to his body lay an eagle's wing. Food would be placed inside his casket before it was closed, enough to keep his spirit nourished on its long westward passage to the other side.\n\nThe sons and others remember that it was dark. The hut was filled with family and members of the Sac and Fox tribe. Smoke floated in the air. Metal pots hung over a fire. The pots were brimming with beef, chicken, venison, corn and pumpkin.\n\nTom Brown, a tribal elder, started the prayers. Patsy was Jim Thorpe's third wife, and she had shown little interest in, and sometimes even disdain for, tribal tradition. She wouldn't have been permitted inside for long regardless; a spouse is not allowed to spend much time with a deceased loved one, as it can disturb the spirit. \"All of this must be done properly, in the traditional way,\" says Sandra Massey, the tribe's historic preservation officer. It has been this way since before white men set foot on North America. It is important to feast on the stew bubbling in the pots, and then to sit with the body in the darkness past sunrise. Sometime before noon the next day, Jim Thorpe's coffin was to be carried out of the hut through a door facing west.\n\nHis body would be taken to a mausoleum while details were completed for a memorial on a family burial plot nearby. Meanwhile, Thorpe's spirit would travel on an extensive journey where it would be tested. His spirit would have to fend off distractions, and it would be asked to give an accounting of his life. According to Sac and Fox beliefs, failing to complete a burial observance has terrible consequences. \"If you don't [finish], he is earth-bound,\" Massey says. \"He is stuck here, stuck on this plane.\"\n\nAs Brown prayed, Patsy burst into the hut.\n\nRichard and Bill and the rest of Jim Thorpe's living offspring looked up, startled. They were the children of his previous two wives. Patsy's relationship with the four sons of Thorpe's second wife, Freeda, was strained. \"A royal piece of work is what she was,\" Richard says. \"To me, that woman, she seemed just mean, all the time.\" Adds Bill: \"The way she looked at it, people answered to her. She didn't answer to anyone.\"\n\nPatsy had brought the police and a few men in suits.\n\n\"He's too cold!\" she declared. She ordered the men to take the coffin.\n\n\"You can't do this!\" Bill shouted. \"No! Absolutely no.\"\n\nJim Thorpe's daughters, Grace, Gail and Charlotte, yelled: \"No! No!\"\n\nSo did other members of the tribe.\n\nBut the police, Bill says, stood nearby \"while the hearse people took the body and the casket.\"\n\nNeither Richard nor Bill remembers Patsy saying more.\n\nThe two sons recall a sense of sheer helplessness. Patsy was white. Whites held virtually unquestioned authority on native land, especially in places like rural Oklahoma. The tribe members in the ceremonial hut had been conditioned to acquiesce.\n\n\"The feeling was like this,\" Bill says. \"'What can we do?'\"\n\nJim Thorpe's children and members of the tribe never saw him or his coffin again.\n\n\"The way it happened that night -- hell yeah, I'm still angry,\" Bill says. \"That kind of hurt doesn't go away.\"\n\nTHE BATTLE OF Little Big Horn and the Nez Perce conflict were over, but the Massacre at Wounded Knee was still to come, when Jim Thorpe was born on May 28, 1887, in a wood cabin near Shawnee, on what was called an Indian allotment.\n\nThe United States was suppressing Native American religious practices, banning reservation residents from leaving without permission, putting agents in charge of the welfare of their children and sending them to Indian boarding schools hundreds of miles from home to forcibly assimilate them into white culture.\n\nHiram Thorpe, Jim's father, was part Sac and Fox and part white. Charlotte Vieux, Jim's mother, was part white and part Potawatomi. As sometimes happened to Native American children, Jim Thorpe was baptized a Catholic and given a Christian name, Jacobus Franciscus. But he came to identify as a Native American and followed Sac and Fox ways as much as he could.\n\n\"Dad was connected to the land,\" Richard says. \"It gave him peace. Made him strong.\"\n\nBy age 8, he was an expert fisherman and hunted deer and turkey. By 10, he was breaking wild horses. He liked to spend days alone, studying the movements of animals.\n\nApart from athletics, little came easy for him. His twin brother, Charlie, died of smallpox as a child. By his midteens, Jim had lost both his parents. He was sent away to a series of Indian schools. \"Relentless and brutal places,\" says Philip Deloria, a professor of history and American culture at the University of Michigan. \"They were trying to beat the Indian out of these kids, and the kids were often paying with their lives.\"\n\nThorpe gained national attention at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, where he played football for Glenn \"Pop\" Warner. In the first game of his breakout sophomore season, Thorpe, a pounding defender and slashing back, scored six touchdowns in two quarters. In 1912, Carlisle played Army at West Point, where George Custer is buried. \"Your fathers and grandfathers fought their fathers,\" Warner told his team. \"These men playing against you today are soldiers. They are Long Knives. Tonight we will know if you are warriors.\"\n\nThe game was a demolition. Carlisle won, 27-6.\n\n\"Standing out resplendent in a galaxy of Indian stars,\" reported The New York Times, \"was Jim Thorpe, recently crowned the athletic marvel of the age. At times the game itself was almost forgotten while the spectators gazed on Thorpe, the individual, to wonder at his prowess.\"\n\nThorpe, 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds in his prime, went on to become the nation's biggest draw in the early days of professional football. He played baseball, as well, including six seasons in the major leagues. He batted .252 in his career with the New York Giants, Cincinnati Reds and Boston Braves, including a .327 season in 1919.\n\nBut it was during the 1912 Olympics that he gave people reason to regard him as the world's best athlete.\n\nHe hardly trained. When he traveled to Stockholm aboard the S.S. Finland, he was relegated to sleeping in steerage while others on the U.S. team enjoyed upper-level staterooms. But he won a gold medal in what was then the pentathlon, which combined a long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, 200-meter race and 1,500-meter race. Except for finishing third in the javelin, he placed first in each event.\n\nHe took a second gold in the decathlon, to this day considered the ultimate test of overall athletic ability. He beat his closest challenger by nearly 700 points, setting a world record of 8,412 points -- a record that would stand for 20 years.\n\nFew knew it at the time, but just before the decathlon's 1,500, Thorpe had reached into his bag and found his shoes were missing. He went to the locker room and found a replacement shoe for his left foot. Then he dug in a trash can and found one for his right. In this mismatched, ill-fitting pair, he won the race.\n\n\"He could really move,\" Richard Thorpe says, looking up at a painting of his father in Stockholm. \"He was too old to show it by the time I came around, but sometimes you could see it. He could still have that ease.\"\n\nJim Thorpe's dominance at the Olympics, together with his feats in football and baseball, turned him into an icon. Deloria calls him \"the first pop star\" in American sports. In 1951, The Associated Press asked sports reporters and broadcasters to pick the greatest athlete of the half-century. Babe Ruth was second. The winner, by a large margin, was Jim Thorpe.\n\nWhen he won his gold medals, Thorpe was not yet an American citizen (most Native Americans didn't receive full citizenship until the 1920s) and he struggled to balance white expectations with his identity as an Indian. He was \"part of the outside world, but he always felt a distance from it,\" Bill Thorpe says. \"When you grow up the way he did, that's just the way it was.\"\n\nThorpe drank too much. He worked to control it, but Bill says the combination of alcohol, bars and a nettlesome public sometimes led to fights. His first child, Jim Jr., contracted polio at age 3 and died in his arms. He and his first wife, Iva, had three more children -- daughters Gail, Charlotte and Grace -- before she divorced him, citing desertion. He had four sons with Freeda: Carl, Bill, Richard and Jack.\n\nRichard and Bill remember good times with their father. Roughhousing, fishing off the piers of Southern California, trips to San Diego. But he \"wasn't easy,\" Bill says. \"I think I still have a few scars on my butt from when he took a belt to us.\" After 15 years, Jim and Freeda were divorced in 1941.\n\nFor much of his adult life, a shadow hung over Thorpe. In 1913, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) retroactively deemed him a professional (he had left Carlisle for a short time to play semi-pro baseball) at the time of his Olympic competition and famously stripped him of his medals. He was an easy target: Native American, and not well educated.\n\nThorpe's playing days extended into the late 1920s. Afterward, he bounced around. He lived in California, Nevada, Michigan, Illinois and Florida. He coached, sold cars, joined the Merchant Marine and became a security guard at a Ford plant. He owned bars, judged dance competitions and dug ditches. He drove a Model T across the country, hunting dogs at his side, and delivered speeches extolling physical exercise. He dressed in Native garb and lectured schoolkids and community groups on the history and potential of his people. In Hollywood during the 1930s and '40s, he found his steadiest foothold, playing bit parts alongside Errol Flynn, Mae West and Buster Keaton.\n\nIn 1945, Thorpe married Patsy, a dark-haired nightclub singer. She boasted of playing piano in one of Al Capone's Chicago bars. Kate Buford, author of \"Native American Son: The Life and Sporting Legend of Jim Thorpe,\" says Patsy was intelligent and witty but \"also an alcoholic who was manipulative, mercurial, predatory and sometimes cruel and unbalanced.\"\n\nJim and Patsy Thorpe had a stormy relationship, full of hard drinking and sometimes fights. She managed his business affairs aggressively: booked his speaking engagements, negotiated with movie studios and badgered reporters to write about him.\n\nBut they had trouble holding on to money.\n\nBy the early 1950s, they were living in a trailer on the flats of suburban Los Angeles. He underwent surgery for lip cancer. \"We're broke,\" Patsy told reporters at a news conference afterward. She thanked doctors for operating free of charge.\n\n\"Jim has nothing but his name and his memories,\" she said. \"He spent money on his own people and has given it away. He has often been exploited.\"\n\nThorpe suffered a series of heart attacks. His children prepared for the worst. One afternoon, Jim Thorpe began speaking about what the family should do with his body if he died. Bill says his father \"wanted to make sure he was buried in Oklahoma. On Sac and Fox land.\" Bill and Richard Thorpe say he repeated the request to others.\n\nJim Thorpe died on March 28, 1953, of another heart attack.\n\nThe family -- including Patsy, Bill says -- agreed to take his body home to the plot near Prague, close to the Indian allotment where he was born. There would be a traditional Sac and Fox rite, then a Catholic Mass. Afterward, his body would be kept in a mausoleum until Oklahoma built a Jim Thorpe memorial, which was being proposed by a state commission for construction on or near the burial site.\n\nWHEN PATSY THORPE left the hills of Shawnee with her husband's body, she went ahead with the Catholic Mass, then took him to a local mortuary. Plans for a Jim Thorpe memorial were falling through. It was budgeted to cost at least $25,000 in public money, but Gov. Johnston Murray said the state couldn't afford that much and refused to fund it.\n\nWithout consulting her husband's children, Patsy began to look elsewhere.\n\n\"Moving my father's body around like some sort of commodity,\" Bill says.\n\nBiographer Bob Wheeler, author of \"Jim Thorpe: World's Greatest Athlete,\" interviewed Patsy during the late 1960s, a few years before her death. Wheeler says Patsy told him she began shopping the body when Oklahoma refused to pay for his memorial. \"She was so incensed that she just lost it,\" Wheeler says. \"It would take a master psychologist to ascertain her motivations. Her personality was extremely complex.\"\n\nPatsy looked east. There might be money in Pennsylvania, where Thorpe had gained his initial fame playing football for the Carlisle Indian school. Town fathers picked out a location for a memorial but their plans fell through. The head of a local committee has since said Patsy's dollar demands were too steep.\n\nNext, Patsy went to Philadelphia, where she hoped to persuade NFL commissioner Bert Bell to help. Watching television in a hotel room, she saw a report about two towns some 80 miles to the northwest: Mauch (pronounced Mok) Chunk and East Mauch Chunk, from Native American words meaning \"bear mountain.\" The towns, split by the Lehigh River, were locked in an intense rivalry. One was mostly German, the other Irish. \"When they weren't getting along, one side would cut electricity to the other side because they had the transformer,\" says Danny McGinley, a local bartender and historian. \"The other side had the water, so they would cut the water off over there.\" If a blaze broke out in one town, firefighters say, trucks from the other refused to help without special orders. Both towns depended upon railroads hauling coal, and both had boomed in the 1800s, attracting East Coast tycoons who built mansions and even an opera house. By the 1950s, coal was declining and the towns were economically depressed.\n\nThe TV report said Joe Boyle, editor of the Mauch Chunk Times News, was urging the towns to save money by combining. Boyle had established a fund to build infrastructure, lure employers and revive fortunes. He was asking all Chunkers to contribute a nickel each week. The Nickel a Week Fund caught Patsy's eye. She went to Mauch Chunk and sat down with Boyle. They cut a deal. Patsy would hand over Jim Thorpe's body if her dead husband was honored with a tomb and a public memorial. The towns would combine and rename themselves Jim Thorpe, Pa. The name, she said, would draw tourists and restore the economy.\n\nBoyle died in 1992 and never revealed the terms of the arrangement. Neither have any other leaders among the Chunkers, many of whom are no longer living. Wheeler says Boyle told him that Patsy was paid, but only to reimburse the cost of her travel and lodging.\n\nNot everyone in Jim Thorpe, Pa., was happy with the agreement. Joe Boyle's daughter, Rita, now living in Texas, says, \"Daddy took a lot of heat for it because of the name change. My daddy's life was threatened.\"\n\nSome residents started calling the town \"Jim Chunk.\"\n\n\u0093It bothered him, the look of it, as if no one even really cared. The whole thing really hit him, how far away his father was from home.\u0094\n\n- Anita, on her father Richard's reaction to Jim's grave\n\nStill, when the pact was put to a vote in May 1954, the Chunkers approved consolidation and the tomb by a landslide. The body of Jim Thorpe was sure to create a renaissance. Maybe the NFL would build its Hall of Fame in Jim Thorpe, Pa. Maybe developers would invest in accommodations for a huge influx of tourists, perhaps even a hospital. Maybe there would be an athletic field and a manufacturing plant for sporting goods -- all with good paying jobs. Patsy talked of constructing a hotel with a Native American theme: Jim Thorpe's Teepees.\n\nWhile a memorial was constructed, Thorpe's body sat in a mausoleum in a local mortuary. At one point, a rumor surfaced that his body hadn't actually been inside the casket that Patsy delivered. Joe Boyle and a group of other residents opened the crypt. Onlookers saw that Thorpe was indeed inside, his head wrapped in a plastic bag.\n\nIn 1957, Thorpe's body was placed in the new tomb. Etched on the sides of the red stone monument were pictures of Jim Thorpe playing football and baseball and running track, along with the words spoken by King Gustav V of Sweden at the end of the Stockholm Games: \"You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.\" Thorpe's children did not attend the dedication.\n\nThere would never be a hall of fame or a hospital, no Jim Thorpe's Teepees. To this day, people on the streets of Jim Thorpe, Pa., recite a remark by a city leader, in a Sports Illustrated story from 1982: \"All we got here is a dead Indian.\"\n\nThe tomb and its surroundings fell into disrepair. In the 1990s, Richard Thorpe, along with his daughter, Anita, and her two children, visited the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. They drove farther on, to Jim Thorpe, Pa., where Anita recalls Richard's shock at seeing his father's memorial. Alongside the road, she said it looked like a place where people might stop to \"relieve themselves.\" \"Dad was talkative and cheerful the whole way. Then he saw it, and the moment he did, and from then on all the way back, he hardly said a word,\" she says. \"It bothered him, the look of it, as if no one even really cared. The whole thing really hit him, how far away his father was from home.\"\n\nBill visited the roadside crypt in the 1960s. \"I was saddened to my core,\" he says. \"At that particular time, they didn't even have a sidewalk in front of his plaque. I was there by myself, and I just wanted to spend some time. I stayed for, I don't know, 30, 40, 50 minutes. I was upset. The place looked like -- you know, it looked like hell. The lawn wasn't mowed. Weeds were there, and everything else, you know.\n\n\"But I stayed around, and I visited [with Dad]. We talked.\"\n\nHis voice quivers, and tears appear behind his wire-rimmed glasses. \"It was just, you know -- [I was] sorry to see him go. I can't remember what I said or anything like that, but it was -- it was emotional. Actually, we talked.\"\n\nBill says he got a feeling that his father \"wasn't in the right place.\"\n\nJIM THORPE'S OTHER children shared the feeling. At first they were united. All of them wanted their father's body returned. In time, however, his daughters came to accept Jim Thorpe, Pa. In 1998, Grace presided over a rededication of her father's tomb. \"I want to thank the community for all that you've done,\" she said. \"I know my dad is happy to rest here.\"\n\nAt one point, son Jack seemed to agree. He wrote a letter to the town saying, \"I now feel that the remains of Jim Thorpe are in a good place, and he is at peace.\" But then he changed his mind and rejoined his brothers in demanding that their father be brought back to Oklahoma. The presence or absence of Jim Thorpe's bones, the sons said, would not make or break the town of Jim Thorpe, Pa.\n\nOn June 24, 2010, Jack Thorpe, who by now had served for several years as chief of the Sac and Fox tribe, mounted a legal attack. Patsy had died in 1975, so Jack sued the town.\n\nHis lawsuit, filed in Pennsylvania federal court, cited the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, passed by Congress in 1990, requiring the return of Native American remains and sacred objects. The law, known as NAGPRA, gives tribes and families a way to repatriate Indian remains from museums, which it defines as any agency or institution that receives federal funds.\n\nOver the years, hundreds of thousands of native people have been dug from their graves for storage or display at museums, universities and an array of gallery exhibitions across the country. At a 1987 congressional hearing, Robert McCormick Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, testified that 42.5 percent of the 34,000 human remains in its collection were from Native Americans.\n\nThe federal government itself has exhumed Native Americans. In 1867, the Army surgeon general ordered military medical officers to send him Indian skeletons to study. The goal was to build research collections that aimed to prove white superiority by demonstrating that Indians had smaller craniums. The directive encouraged widespread looting. Medical officers, soldiers and sometimes civilians collected skulls from battlefields and waited for funerals to finish, then raided burial sites for skulls and bodies to send to Washington.\n\nUsing NAGPRA, the 4,000 members of the Sac and Fox tribe already had won the return of nearly 100 bodies. Suzan Shown Harjo, a Cheyenne and Muscogee who helped develop the act and get it passed, says bringing Jim Thorpe home would be important not just for the Sac and Fox but for all Native Americans. \"It would send a message that our people are not being stepped on,\" she says. \"It would show we are not going to be kept as collections or roadside attractions anymore. We are going to stand up to that.\"\n\nTHE SUIT ENRAGED the Thorpians, as residents had come to call themselves.\n\n\"The state of Oklahoma wanted nothing to do with Jim Thorpe, and a community took him in -- our community,\" says Michael Sofranko, the longtime mayor. \"This is the place that took Jim Thorpe in. [We] changed the name of the community, and we have held up our end of the contract. We have done everything we were asked to do.\"\n\nSix decades after the arrival of Thorpe's body, the fortunes of Jim Thorpe, Pa., have, indeed, picked up. Divisions have melted. The economy is strong for a town of only 5,000 in a region still being buffeted by the recent recession. Now, when Mayor Sofranko sits on the second-floor deck at the well-appointed Inn at Jim Thorpe, he sees Broadway bustling with people. Many are tourists. Some pedal red and yellow mountain bikes. Others amble along in stylish hiking boots, passing art studios and coffee shops.\n\nThe mayor concedes that few of the visitors have come to see Thorpe's tomb. They are there to play in the surrounding hills and on nearby rivers, which have become a hot spot for hikers, bikers and whitewater rafters. But Jim Thorpe's tomb and monument has played a part in this, Sofranko says. \"To get things going.\" And residents are proud to possess Jim Thorpe's body. To suggest this might be worth reconsidering, if only on moral grounds, makes the Thorpians dig in. Oklahoma had its chance, says Ray Brader, sitting in the back of his gift shop on Broadway. Mention the spiritual claims of the Sac and Fox, and Brader grows indignant. \"Jim Thorpe the Olympian was brought here, not Jim Thorpe the Native American.\" Thorpe smiles from posters and photos on streetlights and restaurant walls. His image is on T-shirts and coffee mugs. Students go to Jim Thorpe Area High School, home of the Olympians. \"The movie about him with Burt Lancaster ['Jim Thorpe: All-American,' released in 1951], is required viewing when you grow up here,\" says Brandon Fogal, manager of a whitewater rafting business. \"You see that film again and again. You can't escape hearing about him. It's hard to find people of any age who don't feel an attachment.\"\n\nEach spring, Jim Thorpe, Pa., celebrates the birthday of its namesake. At his tomb, a local troupe of Native Americans dance, pray, chant and beat drums. Improvements are noticeable. The tomb is well kept and has additions: a bronze statue of Thorpe throwing a discus, another of him holding a football. Plaques describe his feats. A metal sculpture of a lightning bolt reminds visitors of his Native American name.\n\nAt a firehouse in a neighborhood called The Heights, volunteer firefighter Jay Miller and his colleagues are suspicious. Miller says Oklahoma didn't care about Jim Thorpe until his Olympic medals were restored in 1983. Other townspeople have heard a rumor that the tribe wants to put Thorpe's bones in a casino to boost business. They seem to see little irony in the fact that they have used his bones to build their own economy. Ninety-five percent of the residents of Jim Thorpe, Pa., are white. By count of the latest census, the percentage of Native Americans in town is nearly zero. But its residents do not accept the view that Jim Thorpe is a stranger. They say he belongs with them.\n\nIN COURT, the Thorpians fought back.\n\nTheir attorneys argued that the town was not a museum, even under the most expansive definition of the law. Moreover, they said NAGPRA was not meant to apply to \"modern remains such as those of Jim Thorpe.\" His wife and the town had signed a contract. \"He was merely laid to rest,\" one court document read, \"in accordance with his faith.\"\n\nThe town's case was helped by the fact that Jim Thorpe had never made a will. In the oral tradition of Native Americans, there are few written wills. The town's response also was strengthened by a legal brief from John Thorpe, the 59-year-old son of Jim's daughter Charlotte. In 2005, John, a Lake Tahoe disc jockey, had abandoned his father's surname, Adler, so he could take his grandfather's name instead. \"I am extremely proud of my heritage,\" he says. Nonetheless, he favored leaving his grandfather's body in Jim Thorpe, Pa. He filed his brief after attending a Native American sun dance in Bastrop, Texas, where he went to a sweat lodge. In the steam and the smoke from burning cedar, John says, a spiritual healer \"told me that he had made contact with my grandfather, and these were his words: 'I am at peace, and I want no more pain created in my name.'\"\n\nAs the court battle waged, Jack Thorpe died of cancer at age 73. Bill and Richard Thorpe and the Sac and Fox tribe joined the lawsuit in his place.\n\nOn April 19, 2013, Judge Richard Caputo of the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Pennsylvania ruled in favor of Jim Thorpe's sons and the tribe. NAGPRA, Caputo said, superseded contract law. Congress, he said, had \"recognized larger and different concerns in such circumstances, namely, the sanctity of the Native American culture's treatment of the remains of those of Native American ancestry.\"\n\nBill Thorpe remembers thinking: \"This is all going to be done with soon. Justice.\"\n\nNEARLY 300 ANGRY Thorpians packed a town hall. \"We had an open discussion on what to do,\" Ray Brader says. \"It was very emotional.\" Speakers included members of the Jim Thorpe High School history club. \"It was beautiful,\" adds his co-worker, Anne Marie Fitzpatrick. \"The last thing they said was: 'Please leave our namesake alone.'\"\n\nThe town decided to appeal.\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2014, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Caputo and ruled in favor of the Thorpians. The reversal was based on what is known as the \"absurdity doctrine,\" which judges can use when they think the results of a case have gone against congressional intent.\n\nChief Judge Theodore McKee said Thorpe's burial accommodated the wishes of his wife and was therefore lawful. In addition, McKee said, Jim Thorpe, Pa., did not meet NAGPRA's definition of a museum, even as broad as the definition was.\n\n\"We find that applying NAGPRA to Thorpe's burial in the borough is ... a clearly absurd result ... contrary to Congress's intent to protect Native American burial sites,\" McKee wrote. Therefore, Jim Thorpe, Pa., \"is not subject to the statute's requirement that his remains be 'returned' to Thorpe's descendants.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, there was joy, mixed with relief.\n\nIn Oklahoma, misery. \"It felt like this was the same old story, the same old raw deal that Indian people have always gotten,\" says attorney Stephen Ward, who represented Thorpe's sons and the tribe. \"It felt like the courts just don't work well for Indian people.\"\n\nBill and Richard Thorpe appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOn Oct. 5, 2015, the court declined to hear the case without comment.\n\nBill Thorpe heard the news over the phone. He could barely speak. \"It hurt bad,\" he says. \"The worst part of it is that we felt like we were not being heard. Not even given a listen, a chance to tell our story. It's as if you don't count or exist. But then again, we've gotten used to this sort of thing. It's the Indian way, maybe. We've had to get used to it. Disappointment. Bitter disappointment.\"\n\nTHE BONES OF Jim Thorpe do not rest easy.\n\nBill and Richard Thorpe and the Sac and Fox tribe believe that Jim Thorpe, Pa., wouldn't be harmed by giving up their father's remains. \"What difference could it possibly make?\" Richard says. \"The town can keep its name and everything else. Just give Dad back.\"\n\nMore Pin Kings\n\nStreaming\n\nStream Pin Kings on WatchESPN and on the app beginning Aug. 19.\n\nPodcast\n\nCheck out our 16-episode podcast. Also available on the ESPN App under featured podcasts or on Apple iTunes.\n\nThere has been talk, however vague, of suing in state courts, of a boycott, of getting help from a wealthy Oklahoma oilman, \"someone like T. Boone Pickens,\" says Massey, the Sac and Fox historic preservation officer.\n\nMore concretely, Bill Thorpe has engaged Tom Rodgers, a Washington lobbyist who was a key whistleblower in the 2006 case against Jack Abramoff, the D.C. power broker sent to prison for defrauding Native American tribes. Rodgers, a member of the Blackfeet tribe in Montana, is working pro bono.\n\nHe plans to meet with the civic leaders of Jim Thorpe, Pa. \"I am going to appeal to their sense of ethics and morality,\" he says. \"You are displaying a man's remains and making money off of it. Jim Thorpe may be buried there, but that is not his home. I will remind them of history: how the white man took our land, our children, and then they came and took our spirits and our bones. Failing that, we will go another route.\"\n\nRodgers won't say on the record what that route might be.\n\nMeanwhile, the burial land waits. Thorpe's daughters are interred near Cushing, Oklahoma, surrounded by gentle hills in every direction. His first wife is laid to rest there, too. Behind her is a gray, leaning stone topped by a rounded sculpture of a baby lamb. Buffeted by a century of hard weather, its inscription is so worn that only part of it can be read: \"James, Son of Jim/May 1915\" -- the toddler who died in his arms. Near Stroud, there is a plot in a circular memorial park for military veterans, across the highway from a small casino and a few dozen paces from the tribal headquarters, a police station and grounds used for sacred tribal gatherings. And there is a flat, rectangular cemetery near the North Canadian River and a school that Jim Thorpe attended before he went to Carlisle. It is easy to imagine him as a boy there, chasing horses in the distance, hunting rabbits and squirrels. In one corner, by a low fence, near a leafy tree, lies his father, Hiram.\n\nBill reflects on the possible sites and thinks of his own father, Jim Thorpe.\n\nHe curls his right hand into a fist.\n\n\"We are not giving up.\"\n\nKurt StreeterStreeter is a senior writer for ESPN.",

How does it all knit together?\n\nAnd why were those league phase positions so important?\n\nHere's how it all works.\n\nWhich clubs were in Friday's draw?\n\nOnly the 16 teams who finished in positions 9 to 24 had an interest.\n\nThe clubs who finished in the top eight, who went directly through to the round of 16, were not involved and kept the same four possible opponents.\n\nClubs finishing 25th to 36th had already been eliminated.\n\nWhat was knockout playoff round draw?\n\nThe teams placed 9th to 16th are seeded and will play at home in the second leg, and are listed second.\n\nFC Twente vs. Bodo/Glimt\n\nUnion St.-Gilloise vs. Ajax Amsterdam\n\nAZ Alkmaar vs. Galatasaray\n\nFerencvaros vs. Viktoria Plzen\n\nFC Porto vs. AS Roma\n\nFC Midtjylland vs. Real Sociedad\n\nPAOK Salonika vs. FCSB\n\nFenerbahce vs. Anderlecht\n\nWhat dates are the knockout playoff round?\n\nFirst legs: Feb. 13, 2025\n\nSecond legs: Feb. 20, 2025\n\nSo what about the top eight clubs?\n\nAfter the knockout playoff round draw, the teams who finish inside the top eight will still have four possible opponents.\n\nFor instance, third (Manchester United) and fourth (Tottenham Hotspur) would still be able to play any of 13th, 14th, 19th or 20th (Real Sociedad, Galatasaray, AZ Alkmaar and FC Midtjylland). This is because Man United and Tottenham could yet be drawn into either half, but only into the specific paths for those fixtures.\n\nOnce the knockout playoff round is complete, and two of those clubs have been knocked out, Man United and Tottenham would have two possible opponents remaining: the winners of the knockout playoff round ties.\n\nPossible round of 16 ties:\n\nLazio or Athletic Club play one of the winners of:\n\nFerencvaros vs. Viktoria Plzen\n\nFC Porto vs. AS Roma\n\nManchester United or Tottenham Hotspur will play one of the winners of:\n\nAZ Alkmaar vs. Galatasaray\n\nFC Midtjylland vs. Real Sociedad\n\nEintracht Frankfurt or Lyon will play one of the winners of:\n\nUnion St.-Gilloise vs. Ajax Amsterdam\n\nPAOK vs. FCSB\n\nOlympiacos or Rangers will play one of the winners of:\n\nFC Twente vs. Bodo/Glimt\n\nFenerbahce vs. Anderlecht\n\nWhen is the draw for the round of 16?\n\nThe round-of-16 draw takes place on Friday, Feb. 21, when Man United and Tottenham would simply be drawn into opposite halves of the bracket -- which would automatically create a fixture against one of the winners of AZ Alkmaar vs. Galatasaray and FC Midtjylland vs. Real Sociedad.\n\nThe teams placed 1st to 8th are seeded and will be at home in the second leg.\n\nFirst legs: March 6, 2025\n\nSecond legs: March 13, 2025\n\nThe knockout bracket is now set through to the final. There is no draw for the specific ties of the quarterfinals and semifinals.\n\nIs there country protection?\n\nNo. Clubs from the same country can play each other from the knockout playoff round onward.\n\nIt was also possible for clubs to draw one of the eight teams they'd already faced -- including the most recent opponents from Matchday 8.\n\nWho gets home advantage in the quarterfinals and semifinals?\n\nThere will be one more draw, straight after the round of 16 is set on Feb. 21, to determine the home teams in the second leg for the quarterfinals and semifinals.\n\nThis is not done on league phase seeding, so the final league placings do not give a team home advantage beyond the round of 16.\n\nCan January signings play in the Champions League?\n\nYes, clubs are able to make three changes to their official Champions League squad.\n\nSo, if a club sign four players in the January transfer window they would not be able to register all of them from the knockout rounds of European competition.\n\nThe new list must be submitted by Feb. 6.\n\nThe overall limit of 25 players remains. If a club want to add a new signing, they must remove someone else.\n\nWhy did it matter where a club finished in the table?\n\nThe league placings created the knockout bracket and the new \"seeding\" system means the highest-placed teams can't face each other until the latter stages of the knockout round.\n\nFor instance, if we look at the final table, Lazio and Athletic Club finished in first and second and can't play each other until the final. The teams in third and fourth -- Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur -- can't play Lazio and Athletic Club until the semifinals.\n\nAll paired teams, such as Man United and Tottenham, cannot meet until the final and have the same possible round-of-16 opponents: Real Sociedad, Galatasaray, AZ Alkmaar and FC Midtjylland.",

    "raw_text": "The FIH Men's Hockey World Cup gets underway on Friday and 16 of the world's best teams will battle it out in Odisha from January 13 to 29 for the ultimate prize.\n\nHockey is fun to watch but can be difficult to understand if you're just getting into the sport. This guide for beginners breaks down the game and explains its nuances and how to best follow the sport.\n\nHockey World Cup: India play Spain in opener, midfield battle could be crucial\n\nFirstly, expect plenty of goals\n\nModern hockey has become more attacking in nature: the emphasis is on winning the ball high up the pitch, relentless running, quick passing, more penetrations of the circle (which is aka the D) and winning more penalty corners.\n\nIt's hard to keep a clean sheet, although the scorelines might shrink as the tournament progresses into the knockouts.\n\nSecondly, expect plenty of penalty corners\n\nOr as they earlier called it - short corners. The concept of penalty corners (PC) makes the sport unique and adds excitement. Teams aim to win numerous penalty corners because it's an avenue to score. It doesn't guarantee a goal but counts as a big chance to score. Almost like a free-kick in football.\n\nA team's chances of winning are significantly higher if they have a PC specialist. Examples of some PC experts are India captain Harmanpreet Singh, Australia's Blake Govers and Alexander Hendrickx of Belgium.\n\nWhy Harmanpreet Singh is India's trump card at 2023 Hockey World Cup\n\nWhat is a penalty corner?\n\nA penalty corner is given against the defending team for an infringement inside the penalty circle (15-metre) or deliberate foul in the 23-metre line.\n\nA player (pusher) pushes the ball to the top of the circle from the back line, where another player (stopper) traps the ball before the dragflicker drags the ball just a bit and takes a shot on goal.\n\nA maximum of five defenders (including the goalkeeper) line up on the goal line to save the shot. As the pusher pushes the ball, a few defenders (rushers) run towards the dragflicker to block the effort. It is quite a challenge for the goalkeeper to make a save amidst the many bodies in the circle.\n\nIt also need not be a drag-and-flick hit. Another style is a simple slap of the ball through the ground to beat the rushers and the goalkeeper.\n\nIs it difficult to win penalty corners?\n\nYes and no. Teams who defend better can prevent conceding penalty corners, but the chances to win PCs are more when a team breaches the circle.\n\nThere are various ways to win PCs: it is awarded when the ball hits the defender's foot inside the 15m circle or also for severe offences like dangerous play. A team can also get a PC if defending team deliberately plays the ball over the backline.\n\nAre matches decided on PCs?\n\nThey sure can and having a PC specialist helps.\n\nDragflicker Gonzalo Peillat was vital in Argentina winning the 2016 Olympic gold medal. Hendrickx played a big part in Belgium's golden run at the World Cup and Olympics. Harmanpreet was key to India's Tokyo Olympics bronze medal glory in 2021.\n\nHow's it different from a penalty stroke?\n\nA penalty stroke is given when an infringement within the circle prevents a goal from being scored. Penalty strokes are just like penalty kicks in football. A one-on-one situation where an attacker is trying to score against the goalkeeper from seven yards or 6.47m.\n\nWhat's a free hit?\n\nA free hit is awarded when an opposition player commits a foul outside the circle. The ball has to be stationary and the nearest opposition player has to be five yards away when the free hit is taken. A free hit can also be a self-pass, but when it's not then the ball has to move at least a yard before it is passed to a teammate.\n\nHow many types of fouls are there in hockey?\n\nMany. It's a foul when a player:\n\n- uses his stick dangerously for a challenge\n\n- uses the back of his stick\n\n- challenges the ball by hitting the opponent's stick\n\n- raises the ball dangerously\n\n- pushes, shoves or dangerously advances for the ball\n\n- shields the ball with the stick or body\n\nAdditionally, it's also a foul if a third player interferes with the play by blocking the path of an attacker.\n\nWow, so many?\n\nYes, and it does get confusing. It happens so quickly during the games and play restarts in a matter of seconds. It takes a minute or two to understand the nature of the foul and umpire's decision.\n\nHow many types of cards are there in hockey?\n\nGreen, yellow and red. The green card holds a two-minute suspension, a yellow can mean 5-10 minutes of suspension, while a red means the player misses the remainder of the game.\n\nWhy is hockey so fast?\n\nThat's one of the hallmarks of the sport. Hockey has evolved over the years - from being played on grass, to now on synthetic turfs. From permanent substitutions to rolling subs. The game has shifted from individual dribbling skills to high pressing and quick movements of the ball and from a 70-minute game of two halves to a 60-minute match of four quarters.\n\nThis is also one of the reasons why European nations and Australia have started dominating the sport while India, Pakistan and other Asian teams have fallen behind.\n\nWhat are rolling substitutions?\n\nRolling substitutions allow players to be replaced multiple times during a match. While 11 players start the match, the six subs also have a major role to play.\n\nCan you remove the goalkeeper during a match?\n\nThis generally happens when a team is chasing a game and the clock is running down. They remove the goalkeeper to gain the one-man advantage in the outfield over their opponents.\n\nHockey World Cup: How India can overcome tough opponents in the group stage\n\nWhat happens if a match ends in a draw?\n\nIn the knockout stages, a drawn match is decided by a penalty shootout - five chances per team. However, these are not penalty strokes.\n\nIn a penalty shootout, the attacker will run with the ball from the 23m line in a 1v1 situation with the goalkeeper. The attacker has eight seconds to score. If the goalkeeper unintentionally fouls, then the attacker gets another chance. If the goalkeeper intentionally fouls the attacker, then a penalty stroke is awarded.",

    "raw_text": "COPLAY, Pa. -- A young, redheaded driver pulled up to the corner of 2nd and Chestnut, lowered his window and asked an officer if he would remove the barricade in the street. Nick Shafnisky used to be the star quarterback at Whitehall High and Lehigh University, but on this day, he was merely eastern Pennsylvania's most valuable chauffeur.\n\n\"I've got Saquon in here,\" Shafnisky explained.\n\nOn the nearest corner stood Samuel Owens Casual Family Dining, with a banner advertising a dollar-off happy-hour special over a sign that read, \"Best of Luck Saquon.\" Across the street, in front of Giant Food & Drugstore, stood two large signs side-by-side, one announcing that afternoon, March 24, as \"Saquon Barkley Day,\" and the other announcing Coplay as \"The Little Town That Could. 1 Sq. Mile of God's Little Masterpiece.\"\n\nThe officer moved the barricade so Shafnisky could turn left in his Acura and drop off his former teammate in front of his home. On this cold and cloudless day, with the streets framed by diminishing snow banks, a neighbor's chimes could be heard jingling in the wind. Up the street some locals were eating their eggs and toast at the countertop inside a breakfast joint called the Bacon Strip. Barkley spilled out of Shafnisky's car wearing a gray hoodie, then climbed the stairs to his front porch and greeted the family and friends waiting for him.\n\nSix miles from Allentown, Coplay could pass for something from another Billy Joel song. It is a workingman's refuge, an old mill town known for its medieval-looking kilns and the production of the first Portland cement in the United States in the early 1870s. But on this Saturday, it would be known for delivering the world a running back destined to go down as the next small-town hero from a state that takes its football about as seriously as they take it in Texas. Someday, Saquon Barkley of Coplay might be remembered with the legends from the western side of Pennsylvania, like Joe Montana of Monongahela and Joe Namath of Beaver Falls.\n\nMen, women and children poured in from all over, some wearing his Penn State jersey, No. 26, to witness the parade and ceremony. An estimated 3,200 people live in Coplay. An estimated 5,000-plus people showed up for Barkley's hometown bash.\n\nThe fans who could not wait for the festivities walked right up to Barkley's porch to say hello. Around the corner from GiGi's Pizza & Pasta Grill, the Barkley home is a modest brick-face row house with an exposed light bulb hanging over the front door. Strangers approached and asked Barkley to sign footballs and caps, and to pose for pictures. And he accommodated every last request with his million-dollar smile.\n\nSoon enough he was whisked away and loaded into a Plymouth Prowler. Barkley sat on top of his seat and held his young nephew as the car headed down Chestnut with a few cops walking ahead and two riding on horseback behind it. His father Alibay Barkley, mother Tonya Johnson, siblings and expectant girlfriend, Anna Congdon, all rode in convertibles while people cheered from both sides of the road. War veterans marched, and so did the Whitehall High band. Fans in New York Giants jerseys shouted their hopes that their team would take Barkley with the No. 2 overall pick in the upcoming draft.\n\nThe procession ended in Saylor Park, where local dignitaries and coaches gathered with Barkley and his parents on a makeshift stage near the old, towering kilns. Brian Gilbert, Barkley's high school coach, spoke of how his star running back embodied the \"hard-working, blue-collar community that gets nothing handed to us.\" Gilbert added: \"With Saquon's parents living in the heart of Coplay, I think it was just bred right into Saquon.\"\n\nPhil Armstrong, county executive, recalled working the down markers for many years at Whitehall games. He used to drop the chains and flee whenever a ball carrier approached -- with defenders in close pursuit -- to avoid being barreled over.\n\n\"But then I found out nobody ever caught you,\" Armstrong told Barkley. \"So by the time you were a senior, I just stood there and held the chains and watched you fly by.\"\n\nStephen Burker, a 67-year-old councilman who had spent 15 years working in an Allentown slaughterhouse, took the microphone to introduce the man of the hour. This celebration was Burker's idea. He convinced Barkley's parents that the borough merely wanted to honor Saquon before the draft, not exploit him, even as the councilman admitted, \"This is one of the biggest days in the history of Coplay.\"\n\nBurker called Barkley to the podium and the crowd went wild. Barkley admitted he was nervous. He praised the advocates who pushed him to improve his poor grades at Whitehall High School, and spoke of sacrifices made by his mother and father. \"Everyone loves to praise me on my character, which I'm so thankful for,\" Barkley told his fans. \"But that's a true testament speaking to my parents, how they raised me. I'm so thankful having these two in my life.\"\n\nBarkley promised that soon after he's drafted, he would buy his mother a house in the area \"because Coplay and Whitehall are definitely home for me. And I promised my mom that since I was a little kid, and I'm definitely going to make that dream come true.\"\n\nNow Barkley is eight days away from living the dream, from being drafted, from following Super Bowl champions Matt Millen and Dan Koppen as Whitehall grads who made it to the NFL. The franchise that picks Barkley won't only be getting the best of Coplay, Pennsylvania. It will also be getting the Bronx-born son of a once-troubled fighter and the woman who wouldn't let him or anyone else take her family down.\n\nAlibay Barkley lifted the sleeve of his sweatshirt to reveal a New York Jets tattoo above his left elbow. He liked them long before his son Saquon decided he wanted to someday run the football like Curtis Martin.\n\n\"That's the team that, when I was going through my hard times, they pulled me through a lot of stuff,\" Alibay said.\n\nRaised poor in the Bronx, the son of a shoemaker and nephew of former world boxing champ Iran Barkley, Alibay was an amateur fighter who was once his own worst enemy. He got nailed on a robbery charge as a teenager before violating probation with an arrest for possessing an unlicensed gun. Alibay explained to the officers that he had just read the Second Amendment. \"I thought I had the right to bear arms,\" he said.\n\nAlibay said he spent nearly a year inside Rikers Island, then did some boxing before a shoulder injury knocked him out of the ring. He was arrested four additional times for various offenses between 1992 and 2000, each time serving between two and seven days, according to the New York City Department of Correction. He was also trying and failing to kick a drug habit that was controlling his life.\n\nAlibay started a family with his Bronx-born-and-raised wife, Tonya Johnson, but over time Johnson saw gang activity run amok in their Southern Boulevard neighborhood. Her aunt and grandmother had moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where Johnson savored the green grass and fresh air on visits with her children. \"When I was a kid,\" she said, \"I always wanted to move out of New York.\" In 2001, when Saquon and his sister Shaquona were young, their mother finally left to protect their future.\n\n\"It was now or never,\" Johnson said. \"The block I was living on was getting a little too out of hand, and I didn't want to live in fear for my kids. ... You hear some of these stories about people who lost childhood friends, and I didn't want to be one of those mothers.\"\n\nJohnson told Alibay she was leaving for Bethlehem with or without him, his choice. He decided to follow his family and attempt to start living drug-free. \"That showed me his character,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson and the Barkleys escaped New York, but they didn't escape poverty. They moved from Bethlehem to Allentown and ended up homeless for a while as the children stayed with relatives and friends. In 2005 they moved to Coplay, where 13 years later Saquon proved himself worthy of a parade.\n\nAlibay, 49, said on his son's big day in March, that he has been clean for 17 or 18 years, then quickly offered this correction: \"I slipped up one time out here. ... That was like in '04, and that was when we were homeless and I didn't know what to do. That lasted for like four months, and after that I was clean.\"\n\nLast spring, Alibay filed a federal lawsuit against the Allentown police and the local transit agency alleging racial discrimination over a 2016 incident that started as an argument with a bus driver over whether he had paid his fare and ended with officers using a Taser while arresting him. (The misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and theft of services were dismissed. The suit, according to Barkley attorney John Kotsatos, was settled last month to his client's satisfaction.) \"I forgave them,\" Alibay said of the case, \"but what they did was wrong.\"\n\nBald, thickly built and wearing a goatee, Saquon's father maintained that he has found contentment in Coplay through smarter life choices. Alibay was last a cook at a Chili's restaurant in Whitehall and said he plans on returning to work soon. He is most thankful for how his children have carried themselves, including his teenage twins Ali and Aliyah.\n\n\"They are all respectful,\" Alibay said. \"They are all humble. They are all thankful. Saquon's just on a stage that allows everybody to recognize him.\"\n\nKayla Cunningham met Saquon Barkley when they were in middle school. Cunningham was two years older than Barkley and already an accomplished athlete. They became fast friends and regular combatants in the Cunningham basement, where they fought for control of a soccer ball while crashing into furniture and each other.\n\nCunningham knocked Barkley on his back. Barkley knocked Cunningham on hers. \"We would destroy the basement,\" she said. \"The towel rack in the bathroom was broken. Once I thought he gave me a concussion ... when my head hit the back of the couch so hard. We didn't care. We tackled each other and did whatever we had to do to get the ball.\"\n\nNick Shafnisky, the quarterback who was also two grade levels ahead of Barkley, used to wipe the floor with Saquon in wrestling matches in the Cunningham basement. \"Now I'm scared of him,\" Shafnisky said.\n\nThe quarterback was there for the start of Barkley's transition from a smallish, insecure sophomore who thought of quitting the game and later hoped to play for Division II Kutztown University into a 6-foot, 233-pound dynamo with 4.4-second, 40-yard-dash speed, a Greek god's body and the goal of becoming an all-time NFL great. Whitehall was playing Emmaus High that day, and on the final snap of the first half, Shafnisky heaved a pass to his younger, unproven teammate. \"It was a Hail Mary,\" the quarterback recalled, \"and he went up over two guys and caught it for a touchdown. That was the highlight of the year.\"\n\nBarkley accepted an offer from Rutgers because he couldn't believe a Division I school wanted him on a full ride. This was a familiar theme through young Barkley's narrative -- he didn't have a lot of faith in himself. Bob Hartman, the Whitehall athletic director, recalled summoning Barkley to his office to talk about football and schoolwork, and Barkley always asking on arrival, \"What did I do wrong?\" Nothing, of course. \"He just didn't have self-confidence,\" Hartman said, \"until Penn State.\"\n\nBarkley used the Rutgers scholarship to fuel a newfound passion in the weight room. He blew up as a junior, and after James Franklin replaced Bill O'Brien at Penn State, Franklin told Barkley that he needed to switch his commitment to the Nittany Lions and that he wouldn't take \"no\" for an answer.\n\nBarkley was a natural-born pleaser, and a young man of his word, and he had given Rutgers coach Kyle Flood his word that he would play for the Scarlet Knights. \"He wants people to like him,\" Hartman said. \"He wants people to be happy. He wants to be able to help people.\" So Barkley's call to Flood to tell him that he was backing out hurt the recruit as much as it hurt the Rutgers staff.\n\n\"To this day,\" said Cunningham, a soccer player at Temple, \"he still feels bad about making that phone call.\"\n\nBefore he was done at Whitehall, Barkley had made a big name for himself with explosive touchdown dashes and an act of kindness at a track meet that touched everyone who heard about it. Rachel Panek of Saucon Valley had won the 100-meter hurdles at the Colonial League Track and Field Championships in 2015 but was forced to rerun the race because of a breakdown in the meet's timing system. Panek competed in the high jump after her initial hurdles victory and, with tired legs, hit a hurdle and placed eighth in the do-over. Seeing a complete stranger distraught over an obvious injustice, Barkley gave Panek the gold medal he won in his 100-meter race.\n\n\"Saquon was more upset with me that I told the media; he didn't want anyone to know,\" said his track coach, Jim Sebesta. \"I said, 'Saquon, this is unheard of. People just don't do that.' It was the first medal he ever won, in his first year in track at the league meet. He just didn't think it was fair that someone else got screwed.\"\n\nSebesta said Barkley was always pulling for the least talented kids on his teams. He told Barkley that he had grown into such a reliable role model for younger boys, he surely saved some from joining gangs in Allentown.\n\nBut Barkley was not a perfect student-athlete at Whitehall, where Charles Huff, then the Penn State running backs coach, and his staffmate Sean Spencer visited Barkley to warn him that his good deeds and respectful disposition wouldn't win him bonus points and makeup tests in State College.\n\n\"I told him the NCAA doesn't have a makeup,\" recalled Huff, now an assistant head coach at Mississippi State. \"If your grade-point average isn't what it needs to be, they'll take this game away from you. ... I told him, 'You've got three weeks to get all your grades that are a C and D and make them a mid-C or better, or you're not running track.' ... And three weeks later, all his grades were a mid-C or better.\"\n\nA 3.0 student at Penn State, Barkley promised his mother he would earn his degree. He has been taking two classes online during his pre-draft preparation and figures he'll be about 14 credits short when he's done. Barkley said if he doesn't graduate with his class next spring, he'd like to finish up in 2020.\n\nEither way, he will have his first real job before he graduates. The Cleveland Browns will almost certainly take a quarterback with the No. 1 pick, then Barkley will be in play with the Giants at No. 2, and possibly again with the Browns at No. 4. Given the modern NFL's aversion to investing too much in the position he plays, there's a chance Barkley could fall out of the top five.\n\nThe people who know Barkley and have coached and trained him, say that would be a crime. They say Barkley is the best player in this draft, and they offer compelling reasons why.\n\nHartman described Barkley as an old soul who watches old film of old greats. When Hartman and Barkley meet for dinner, the running back is forever asking the AD to rank local players historically. Who are the top 10 running backs in Lehigh Valley history? Where does Nick Shafnisky rank among the best Whitehall quarterbacks ever?\n\n\"He's passionate about that,\" Hartman said. \"He always asks where people stand.\"\n\nFor a simple reason: Barkley wants to stand ahead of everyone in his class. If he ends up in Cleveland, he will undoubtedly target Jim Brown as the greatest running back of all.\n\n\"He told me, 'If I can be LeBron James in Cleveland and turn that program around and win the Super Bowl, it would be the best thing I've done in my life,'\" Cunningham said. \"Who thinks like that? Nobody wants to go to the Browns, and here he is saying, 'I want a statue. I want to be that image for Cleveland.'\"\n\nBarkley put up video-game numbers at Penn State and at the combine. He has less body fat than a supermodel, can catch the ball out of the backfield and regularly hurdles defenders with the greatest of ease.\n\n\"He's got the quads and calves of a 300-pound bodybuilder,\" said Brian Stamper, Barkley's trainer at Tom Shaw Performance in Orlando. In one weight-room session, Stamper was blown away by Barkley's ability to jump off the floor, on his eighth rep, with 365 pounds on his back.\n\n\"I just don't know how you can pass on him,\" Stamper said.\n\nOnly he's not a quarterback and, as always, the Browns desperately need one. So what about the Giants in the two-hole? Barkley said he thinks that 37-year-old Eli Manning \"definitely has a lot in his tank left and is still an extraordinary player,\" and that a potential Barkley-Odell Beckham Jr. pairing would represent a \"pick-your-poison\" proposition for opposing defenses. Despite his father's affection for the quarterback-starved Jets, who are picking third, Barkley agreed that the Giants are the better bet to return to the playoffs sooner rather than later.\n\nAs a first-round running back with matinee-idol looks, Barkley would be a modern-day Frank Gifford in New York, times 10. \"He would absolutely own the city,\" said one influential Giants source. On the other hand, Huff made it clear Barkley has no intention of making regular appearances in gossip columns or in compromising social media videos.\n\n\"Saquon's smile and personality is a great match for New York,\" Huff said. \"But in the city that never sleeps, I can see him going back to his room after a game and playing video games with his family, going to sleep and then going to practice the next day. I don't see him in clubs in the wee hours of the morning.\n\n\"In the end, I don't see him turning into Broadway Joe.\"\n\nIn Saylor Park, after the parade and the ceremony and the announcement that Barkley's Whitehall jersey number (21) would be retired after his brother Ali is done wearing it, word spread that Barkley wouldn't be signing autographs. The people lined up anyway and banked on the fact Barkley has trouble saying no. Their hunch paid off.\n\nBarkley spent two-and-a-half hours signing autographs and taking selfies for an estimated 2,000 people, the line extending across the street into the food-store parking lot. His mother and his agent, Kim Miale of Roc Nation, didn't seem terribly thrilled about it, especially with some fans carrying bags of items to be signed. Someone suggested to Barkley that he stop if and when he grew tired.\n\nThat wasn't about to happen. Earlier in March, after being honored by state legislators at the Capitol in Harrisburg, Barkley asked the driver and chief of staff for State Rep. Jeanne McNeill to stop their van so he could hop out and sign for the 30 or so teenagers calling his name. Once Barkley got going at Saylor Park, he was never going to stop. \"There were still kids in the line,\" Burker said, \"and even if there were 5,000 of them waiting, he can't say no to a kid.\"\n\nCunningham was hardly surprised by the scene. She's long known Barkley as a friend of few flaws; his worst offense as a kid, she said, was playing ding dong ditch.\n\nBarkley has had no choice but to grow up fast. He was worried about his pending fatherhood and how he would measure up as a parent, and a week after learning of his girlfriend's pregnancy, Cunningham sent him an encouraging card and a onesie with mocking directions for a rookie dad. \"I truly believe he will be a better father than football player,\" Cunningham said.\n\nBarkley attended his girlfriend's baby shower after he was finished in Saylor Park, then returned to his pre-draft training. Huff compared his former running back's athleticism to that of Bo Jackson. In speaking about Barkley's character, Huff recalled an 81-yard touchdown in a blowout victory over Purdue. Most players would've been thinking about their SportsCenter highlight near the end of that run, Huff figured. Barkley? He was thinking about stepping out of bounds and allowing a Penn State bench player to enter the game and score on the next play.\n\n\"He's never going to embarrass your franchise,\" Huff said. \"He's a down-to-earth kid. He's not the Bronx or the big city. He'd rather sit on his porch, and if three kids come by with a basketball, go out and try to steal their dribble and play with them for two hours.\"\n\nOver his three years at Penn State, Barkley visited his hometown and Whitehall sporting events as often as he could. He swears that no matter where his superhero calves take him, he will return to Coplay over and over again. \"So it's never going to be goodbye,\" Barkley said.\n\nBut times and people change. Money and worldwide acclaim turned Joe Montana of Monongahela into Joe Cool in dark shades, and Joe Namath of Beaver Falls into Broadway Joe in a mink coat. So what will become of Pennsylvania's latest small-town legend, Saquon Barkley?\n\nThe good people of Coplay believe fame and fortune have finally met their match.",

    "raw_text": "With the NBA announcing 14 reserve picks on Thursday, the 24-player field is set for next month's All-Star Game in San Francisco.\n\nAnd while the game itself has a new format -- All-Stars will be split up into three teams, with Friday night's Rising Stars champion becoming the fourth entry to the three-game mini-tournament -- the debate about who should be there isn't going away.\n\nTo settle that debate, let's break down our 24 selections, including new picks for the 10 starters announced last week.\n\nShould Kevin Durant and LeBron James be starters -- or on the team at all? Will perennial stars Devin Booker and Damian Lillard make the cut? And where does Victor Wembanyama land?\n\nTo make our choices, we followed the same rubric that the NBA does -- two guards and three frontcourt players for the starters and two guards, three frontcourt players and two wild cards for the reserves. No shoehorning players into positions for which they aren't eligible. Rules are rules, after all. (As a reminder: If you say, \"Player X is an All-Star!\" you have to say which player they would replace.)\n\nOur star-studded field is filled with snubs and agonizing decisions and is ripe for debate. Let's get to the picks.\n\nNBA All-Star 2025: Full rosters, news and schedules\n\nStarters\n\nG: Jalen Brunson, New York Knicks\n\nG: Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nF: Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics\n\nF: Karl-Anthony Towns, New York Knicks\n\nReserves\n\nG: Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nG: Cade Cunningham, Detroit Pistons\n\nF: Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nF: Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics\n\nF: Pascal Siakam, Indiana Pacers\n\nWC: Damian Lillard, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nWC: Tyler Herro, Miami Heat\n\nWhy the East presents roster battles everywhere\n\nThree East starting spots are locks. Antetokounmpo and Tatum should be consensus choices, and both should appear on the vast majority of ballots in ESPN's second MVP straw poll of the season next month. Ditto for Brunson, the driver of everything Tom Thibodeau's club does. That leaves the second guard and third frontcourt spots. And the debate, not surprisingly, includes three Cavaliers: Garland and Mitchell for the guard spot, and Mobley alongside Towns for the frontcourt spot.\n\nLet's start with guard and the debate between Garland and Mitchell. By stats, Garland has a very strong case. Cleveland has an absurd 125 offensive rating when Garland is on the court this season, and he's having a more efficient season than Mitchell across the board while also generating more assists.\n\nUltimately, this is about a bit more than numbers. Spend any time around the East-best Cavaliers and you'll see Mitchell is the player everyone takes their cues from. That is why, ultimately, he gets the second backcourt spot alongside Brunson. Garland slots into our first reserve spot.\n\nTowns against Mobley for the final frontcourt spot is also an interesting debate. Towns has had a fantastic season as the other half of New York's offensive engine and taking on massive minutes -- many out of position as the Knicks await the return of the injured center Mitchell Robinson.\n\nTowns sits at 25.1 points and 13.9 rebounds per game with incredibly efficient shooting numbers (54.5% overall and 43.4% from 3). His defense, while improved, remains a weakness.\n\nMobley, meanwhile, is one of the most impactful defensive players in the league and is taking significant strides offensively this year (increases in points, 3-point attempts and percentage, free throw attempts and percentage) while also having impressive advanced metrics buttressing his case.\n\nIn the end, the spot went to Towns because he has to carry a heavier burden for the Knicks than Mobley does for the Cavaliers. That doesn't diminish Mobley's impact one bit, as his ascension this season has not only played a massive role in Cleveland's rise, it gives the franchise hope of a sustained run in the league's upper echelon.\n\nBoth are deserving choices. But for now, Mitchell and Garland are the Cavs' offensive focal points, and Mobley has another excellent defensive big next to him in Allen. The Knicks, on the other hand, are almost 11 points per 100 possessions worse with Towns off the court, and their offense craters without him.\n\nThe fourth guard spot was also a relatively simple choice, with Cunningham getting the nod. Between Detroit's rise into playoff contention and his putting up massive numbers as the driver of the team's offense (24.5 points, 6.5 rebounds, 9.3 assists on 45/37/81 splits), this is as much recognition of the Pistons as it is Cunningham's achievements, but he has more than earned this spot.\n\nThe East frontcourt was filled with difficult decisions. (I don't particularly understand why the NBA uses a format of two guards, three frontcourt players and two wild cards to fill out the reserves. If it was up to me, I would simply say to pick the seven most deserving players who weren't voted in as starters.)\n\nFor example, I considered several guards for the final two wild-card spots, and there were no frontcourt players who made it under consideration. This team easily could've had seven or eight guards on it, but instead, there had to be a couple of extra frontcourt players who aren't quite as deserving.\n\nBoth Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner would have been clear options at different points this season, but oblique injuries have knocked both out of contention. Before the season, Joel Embiid and Paul George would have been expected to be in the running for a spot on this team, and neither is within a hundred miles of it. Bam Adebayo's numbers have taken a significant dip, leaving him nowhere near consideration for a spot, either. (Jimmy Butler, too, for a multitude of reasons.) Another All-Star last year, Scottie Barnes, also doesn't have a strong case. Josh Hart would get a spot if he was a frontcourt option.\n\nSo, with Mobley locked into the first frontcourt reserve spot, and those seven players off the board, it would be great to have the plethora of guards as options. Instead, the choice came down to the following guys: Brown, Siakam and Jarrett Allen (OG Anunoby and Jalen Johnson have had nice seasons but didn't make my cut).\n\nBrown has been part of Boston's confusing malaise in recent weeks (8-6 since Jan. 1). However, he has taken on the challenge every night of guarding the best perimeter offensive threat, and he carries a significant burden alongside Tatum as the two offensive engines of one of the NBA's best teams, so he gets one of the spots basically by default.\n\nThat leaves a very interesting choice between Siakam, who has been the most consistent force on the resurgent Pacers this season, and Allen, who has been a key cog on the NBA's most surprising team.\n\nAllen is durable (he has played every game this season) and productive (14 points, 10 boards, 70% shooting), and Cleveland has an argument for getting four players in. Siakam has also played every game this season, scoring over 20 points on 52% shooting with a career-best 41% from deep for an Indiana team that is 9-2 in 2025.\n\nI went back and forth but ultimately settled on Siakam for essentially the same reason I went with Towns over Mobley: default to the player who carries the greater burden on a nightly basis. That has clearly been Siakam.\n\nSeven players for two spots? Wild-card chaos among reserves\n\nNow we get to the two East wild cards, where several guards -- LaMelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Tyler Herro, Zach LaVine, Damian Lillard, Tyrese Maxey and Trae Young -- all have cases to be considered for final roster spots.\n\nMaxey was the first to be eliminated. Yes, he's averaging a career-high 26.4 points, but as his usage has expanded for the injury-riddled Sixers, his shooting percentages have plummeted. (Even the most die-hard 76ers fans wouldn't argue this team deserves a representative in San Francisco.)\n\nA lot of the all-in-one numbers would argue Haliburton deserves one of these two spots, and he has certainly come on after an extremely rough start, but his overall r\u00e9sum\u00e9 falls a bit short of his competitors here, making him the next one to go.\n\nBall has one of the more interesting All-Star candidacies in recent memory. His numbers are eye-popping: He's averaging 29 points and 7.5 assists and has a staggering usage rate of 35.7% (including a league-leading 24 shots per game and 12 3-point attempts per night), the highest of any qualified player this season. But the rebuilding Hornets are nowhere near a playoff berth, and Ball having the ball in his hands so much of the time is, by nature, boosting his stats. A similar narrative follows NBA assists leader Young, who is helming a young Hawks team into a potential playoff spot, but he also falls a bit short of making my final cut.\n\nLaVine's and Herro's numbers, across the board, are virtually identical. Both are averaging 24 points, and Herro has slightly higher assist numbers while LaVine has been the more efficient scorer. Chicago's offense is a staggering 12 points per 100 worse when LaVine is on the bench, while Miami's is 10 points worse when Herro sits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I might have chosen LaVine. But given Chicago's fall over that span -- including losses to the Pelicans, Hornets, Trail Blazers, 76ers and shorthanded Hawks, among others -- the nod for one spot goes to Herro, Miami's one consistent perimeter shot creator during the ongoing Butler saga.\n\nThat leaves Lillard for the final spot. He isn't quite the dominant backcourt force he once was, but he's still averaging 25 and 7 while shooting close to 40% from 3 on high volume. He and Antetokounmpo are regularly the only reliable scoring threats for Milwaukee.\n\nWestern Conference picks\n\nStarters\n\nG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nG: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors\n\nFC: Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets\n\nFC: Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs\n\nFC: Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies\n\nReserves\n\nG: Kyrie Irving, Dallas Mavericks\n\nG: Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nFC: Jalen Williams, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nFC: Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nFC: Domantas Sabonis, Sacramento Kings\n\nWC: Kevin Durant, Phoenix Suns\n\nWC: LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nA starting lineup shuffle, plus major frontcourt competition\n\nJokic and Gilgeous-Alexander will go down to the wire in the MVP race and are automatic choices here. Curry is, too, once Luka Doncic was knocked off the ballot because of a calf injury. (Doncic's injury knocked him off the ballot entirely, easing an already complicated decision for the back end of the roster.)\n\nWhile James and Durant were lined up alongside Jokic in the league's official starting lineup unveiled last week, Wembanyama and Jackson have better cases.\n\nWembanyama's rocket ship to stardom has been as obvious as it has been expected. But while the numbers are eye-popping -- 24 points, 10 rebounds and a league-leading 3.9 blocks per game with improving scoring efficiency on all three levels -- what truly stands out is that San Antonio is 13.9 points per 100 possessions better when Wembanyama is on the court this season.\n\nJackson is having a wildly underrated season in Memphis. For a Grizzlies team that has exceeded expectations despite Ja Morant already missing 19 games, Jackson has played in 45 of Memphis' 47 games this season. Jackson has built on his developmental time last year as the fulcrum of the Grizzlies' offense amid many injuries to post a career high in points per game (22.8) while playing almost three minutes fewer per night than he did last year.\n\nWith Doncic's injury knocking him out of the picture, Irving and Edwards were easy choices as the reserve guards. Irving has been efficient, durable and available for Dallas, while Edwards has shown massive increases in his 3-point attempt rate and volume en route to posting a career-high 26.3 points per game.\n\nSome might be surprised to see Williams get the first frontcourt reserve spot, but he has had an impressive season in OKC as the team's secondary shot creator and distributor behind Gilgeous-Alexander. Williams is in the league's top 15 in estimated plus-minus, continues to take on significant defensive assignments and is a big part of why this team has continued racking up wins while Chet Holmgren, Isaiah Hartenstein and Alex Caruso have all missed significant time with injuries.\n\nWhile Davis will not be the Defensive Player of the Year, Lakers coach J.J. Redick has followed through on his preseason pledge to make Davis the focal point of the Lakers' offense. The big man has delivered. He has been an impact player at both ends of the court and is producing at a higher rate on increased volume, more than he has during any of his six seasons in Los Angeles.\n\nSabonis might be considered a questionable pick as the third and final frontcourt selection, but he shouldn't be. Sacramento's offense is a full 10 points worse per 100 possessions with him on the bench, and his numbers across the board -- 21 points, a league-leading 14.6 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 60.9% shooting and 48.1% from 3 -- are eye-popping.\n\nWhy LeBron and KD aren't starting -- and who they narrowly beat out\n\nNow, the fun part: We are 10 players in, and still haven't found spots for Durant or James.\n\nJames, in particular, has had a confusing season. He remains an excellent individual offensive player -- he's averaging nearly 24 points per game on over 50% shooting, hitting nearly 40% from 3 and getting 9 assists per game. But the Lakers are a significantly worse defensive team with him on the court: 8.6 points per 100 possessions across the whole season, and even 6 points per 100 possessions over the past several weeks since James took a two-game, mid-December break to recharge.\n\nDurant is having another metronomically efficient season: 27.1 points per game shooting over 50% for a 14th consecutive season. Those numbers have come with his worst plus-minus since his first two seasons in the league as the Suns fight to stay in the play-in mix.\n\nBut is there anyone who should overtake either legend? The most notable name missing so far is Durant's teammate, Devin Booker, who obviously is one of the 12 best players in the Western Conference on pure talent. But Booker's first two months were far below his usual standard from an efficiency standpoint, and even after some recent improvements he is still shooting his lowest percentage since his third season in the league.\n\nAfter consistently pushing Phoenix to elite offenses whenever he was on the court in the past, he hasn't this year. The Suns have an offensive rating of 114.3 when he's on the court, his lowest since 2018-19 when Phoenix finished 19-63.\n\nThe most glaring omission from this team is any representation from the second-place Houston Rockets. Amen Thompson would be on this team if the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s were contained to just this month's play, though center Alperen Sengun has the best argument over the course of the season. Houston's offense is seven points per 100 possessions better with him on the court, but his stats lag a bit behind Sabonis and aren't strong enough to lift him over James or Durant.\n\nJames Harden and Norman Powell have both had underrated seasons for the LA Clippers, one of the biggest surprises in the league. Powell, in particular, is having a career year at 31 years old, with LA's offense over 11 points per 100 better with him on the court. And Powell's scoring average has jumped a full 10 points (23.9 from 13.9) year-over-year.\n\nUltimately, no one could quite make the case to unseat James or Durant for the final two spots. They aren't starting for this team like they are in next month's game(s), but the two future Hall of Famers still very much belong.",

    "raw_text": "Super Bowl I 1966: Green Bay Packers\n\nBart Starr, QB Designed by Packers coach Vince Lombardi and teammates Willie Davis and Bob Skoronski, Starr was beyond proud of his Super Bowl I ring. \"I think Bart just brought it home one day when they gave it to him at the Packers' office,\" said Starr's wife Cherry. It was pretty enough, with a one-carat diamond set in a globe of white gold. But Starr preferred wearing his Super Bowl II ring with three diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires. One day Cherry got a call claiming that Bart's original Super Bowl II ring was being sold on eBay for $100,000. \"I panicked,\" she said, \"and went running back to our safe and opened it up and thankfully it was still there. It scared me. It was a duplicate, but it looked like the real thing.\" To ensure nobody ever sold Starr's rings, Cherry donated them to the team's Hall of Fame during Bart's final trip to Lambeau Field in 2017.\n\nSuper Bowl II 1967: Green Bay Packers\n\nBob Long, WR It's a good thing Long has three rings \u2014 one for each of his children. The receiver has one for the 1965 NFL Championship, one for Super Bowl I and one for Super Bowl II. \"I have three kids, so I'm glad I have three rings,\" Long said. \"When my first son, Andrew, was born, I gave him my ring and put it in a safety deposit box. I haven't seen it in 40 years. My daughter, Jordan, gets one and my adopted son, Christian gets one.\" Long showed up to the first day of Packers training camp this past summer wearing his ring from Super Bowl II, and he was proud to explain why it contained by three diamonds. \"(Vince) Lombardi designed the rings himself and my Super Bowl I ring has one diamond,\" Long said. \"Super Bowl II, Lombardi wanted something to recognize the event of three-straight championships.\"\n\nSuper Bowl III 1968: New York Jets\n\nJohn Schmitt, C \"A miracle,\" that's how Schmitt described getting his ring back after four decades. Through an implausible series of events, he was reunited with his ring after he lost it while surfing in Hawaii 40 years ago. A lifeguard found it while snorkeling, then stashed it in his closet. When he died in 2011, his great-niece discovered the hidden treasure while rummaging through his belongings. Once they identified it as a Super Bowl ring, they contacted the NFL, which directed them to the Jets. Schmitt would befriend the family that found his ring and their bond remains strong. \"We've become a big family,\" says Schmitt, who has vacationed with the family in Hawaii.\n\nSuper Bowl V 1970: Baltimore Colts\n\nBill Curry, C Arthritis has kept Colts center Curry from wearing his Super Bowl V ring. \"It's been years and years since I've put it on,\" Curry said. \"And when I have put it on, I've had to force on my finger pretty good. Things start to change on your body once you hit mid-70s. There was definitely a special time I wore it.\" Curry said the last time he wore the rings was at the funeral of Johnny Unitas, the starting quarterback on the Colts' Super Bowl team. \"That was just one of many ways to pay respect to Johnny,\" Curry said. \"People are always intrigued that I snapped the ball to [Green Bay quarterback] Bart Starr and Johnny Unitas. Super Bowl V was the last ring I won after playing in Super Bowls I, III and V.\"\n\nSuper Bowl VI 1971: Dallas Cowboys\n\nLee Roy Jordan, LB \"My wife OK'd it for me to wear that on my left hand instead of wearing my wedding band,\" Jordan said of the ring he earned after the 1971 season. \"I dislocated my right ring finger so many times I couldn't get it on that finger. I convinced her that I needed to be wearing it. She must've felt like the marriage was going to work and she said OK.\" Jordan and his wife, Mary, have been married for 55 years.\n\nSuper Bowl VII 1972: Miami Dolphins\n\nDick Anderson, S A member of the Dolphins' No-Name Defense, Anderson said the 1971 team actually got Super Bowl rings after losing. But they were silver, not gold. Then, at the beginning of the 1972 season, coach Don Shula tried to inspire his players by telling them no one remembers who lost the Super Bowl and \"our goal is to be remembered.\" Anderson said: \"I look down at those 16 diamonds and the one in the middle and smile. I wear it proudly. It represents 17-0. It was the only perfect season. It's a reminder that we did something that no one else has done. It was a special team.\" The Dolphins' organization brings back members of the 1972 team every five years to celebrate that milestone season, they sign memorabilia as a group and share memories of the perfect season.\n\nSuper Bowl VIII 1973: Miami Dolphins\n\nLarry Little, G The Super Bowl ring from 1973 has less significance than the one from the year prior, Little said, because that Dolphins team went 17-0. \"I don't even know where it is,\" Little said of the second ring. \"It's somewhere in the house. My wife put it up.\" Most of the Dolphins from the 1972 team played on the '73 team as well. Little did say the Dolphins \"were a better team in 1973 than 1972, even though we lost two games that year. We walked through the playoffs. It was easier for us to win the Super Bowl in 1973.\"\n\nSuper Bowl IX 1974: Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nJoe Greene, DT \"About four years ago, I was at the (Dallas-Fort Worth) airport, and on the driver side of the car, I opened the door and when I put my hand down to get out, the ring fell off. I saw a car coming slowly and it was too close for me to pick up the ring. And a car ran over the ring. It came back, I picked it up, the diamonds and stones were still there but it changed the shape of my ring. It was an oval shape instead of round because the wheel went over the side of the ring instead of on top of it. I wore it a while but figured I better send it in to (a jeweler) and they repaired it for me. Looks great now.\"\n\nSuper Bowl X 1975: Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nTerry Hanratty, QB About 15 years ago, Hanratty brought both Super Bowl rings to a show-and-tell session at his daughter's kindergarten class. He passed around the rings for the classmates to view firsthand, and when he went to collect them, the Super Bowl X ring was missing. \"The teacher was sort of shocked,\" Hanratty said. \"She started looking around. I said, 'I'm not leaving until I get it.'\" Eventually, a boy in the back of the class opened a book where he had rested the ring. He was caught. \"The kid was trying to cop the ring,\" he said.\n\nSuper Bowl XI 1976: Oakland Raiders\n\nFred Biletnikoff, WR The Super Bowl XI MVP takes a special pride in donning his ring, only breaking it out on rare occasions. \"It's in a very safe place,\" Biletnikoff said with a laugh. \"It means everything. After all the years of being so close and all the conference championship games, to all of a sudden have everything go right and we break through and win the whole thing? That ring means a lot.\" Indeed, before breaking through to win Super Bowl XI, Biletnikoff's Raiders had played in Super Bowl II, lost consecutive AFL title games and fell in four of the next six AFC championship games. \"With what we went through, with all the heartbreak and crazy plays,\" he said, \"there's a lot of pride. Nobody can take it away.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XII 1977: Dallas Cowboys\n\nDrew Pearson, WR \"I lost mine at Studio 54. I didn't want to be noticed or get in any negative situation so I took my ring off because I didn't want to flash it around,\" Pearson said. \"I put it in my coat pocket and it was cool for a while, then I got to dancing and got hot so I took my coat off. When I put it back on, the ring wasn't there. I panicked.\" Pearson talked to the club manager who said he was welcome to come back when the cleaning crew arrived to look for it. By the time Pearson reached his hotel room, the ring had been found \"I went back in the morning and got it. Here's how big a deal losing my Super Bowl ring in New York City was \u2014 it ended up in the New York Times. They covered it.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XIII 1978: Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nRocky Bleier, RB At speaking engagements, Bleier gives the audience a chance to take pictures with the rings, touch them and try them on. And since the Super Bowl XIII ring is the gaudiest, he wears it the most \u2014 which has become a problem. \"People will try it on and then walk away,\" Bleier said. \"A few steps later, they realize it's still on their finger and they have to bring it back and apologize.\" The rings have been to all 50 states, Canada, Germany, Italy, England and Vietnam. They've set off TSA alarms in airports. \"It's a wonderful, warm experience I have from a fan base, their appreciation of what that stands for when they see the rings,\" Bleier said. \"Even some Patriots fans have put them on. Tom Brady is not showing his six, so this is the closest they get.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XIV 1979: Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nJon Kolb, OL Not all of the originial diamonds from Jon Kolb's rings, which reside at the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame, are intact. A couple have been replaced with high-quality fakes as his family has used the bling for their own jewelry over the years. \"My wife took the first one and made a necklace, she took the second one and made earrings,\" Kolb said. \"My son Tanner took the third one and made a wedding ring for his wife. And Caleb, my youngest son, I told him he could have the fourth one when he was ready. He's got that at a jeweler. It's really neat to me because my hands, they don't fit rings. All four of them are getting used.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XV 1980: Oakland Raiders\n\nJim Plunkett, QB Nearly 30 years after winning Super Bowl XV MVP honors, Plunkett packed his ring and wallet in a fanny pack and put it in his car overnight, before catching an early-morning flight. His car was broken into and the fanny pack was gone. Heartbroken, Plunkett ordered a replacement. A year later, he received a phone call from a construction company working next door. The fanny pack, with the ring still in it, was found in the neighbor's hedges. \"The money was gone, but the thieves didn't find the ring in the back zipper of my fanny pack,\" Plunkett said. \"It was a little devastating to have it stolen. To get it back was pretty incredible. There was a lot of disappointment and hard work that went into getting that ring.\" Plunkett also has a ring from Super Bowl XVIII. But the ring he wears is the one stolen and recovered.\n\nSuper Bowl XVI 1981: San Francisco 49ers\n\nMike Shumann, WR About a year after winning it, Shumann was on a plane back to alma mater Florida State when he nearly dropped the ring down a bathroom sink. \"Being a wide receiver, I had the quick hands still,\" Shumann said. \"The best catch I ever made.\" Years later, while broadcasting for the ABC affiliate in the Bay Area, he went to In-N-Out Burger while heading back from 49ers training camp. The greasy burger sent Shumann to the bathroom to wash his hands, where he left the ring on the sink. Shumann realized it about halfway home and called the restaurant. It had been found by an employee. He returned with an autographed football, tickets to a game and $100 for the worker who found it. \"Those are the two moments for me that were just ultimate panic,\" Shumann said. \"Unless I absolutely have to, I don't travel with it any longer.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XVII 1982: Washington\n\nAlvin Garrett, WR In 1989, Garrett decided his Super Bowl ring held no value to him and could help fund his desire to become a minister. He took out an ad in the Washington Post and sold the ring. \"I flew to La Guardia in New York and the guy paid me cash for it,\" Garrett said. \"My life was so screwed up I needed God.\" In 2016, someone who worked in the jewelry business in New York was picking through a box of items. They found Garrett's damaged ring with the diamonds missing. They contacted Washington, who located Garrett, living in Huntsville, Alabama. The ring was restored and, Garrett said, \"You can't tell the difference.\" He now keeps it stored away. But he's thankful. \"It was like a miracle,\" he said. \"It blew me away. I'm serious. Thirty years man and the circle comes back to you.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XVIII 1983: Los Angeles Raiders\n\nMarcus Allen, RB The Super Bowl XVIII MVP's ring keeps great company, the bauble kept in a fine wood box along with his Pro Football Hall of Fame, his USC national championship, and his Heisman rings, among other hardware. Yes, the 1982 NFL rookie of the year/1985 NFL MVP/1993 NFL comeback player of the year may very well be the most decorated football player in history. And while his hands are so mangled from years of carrying the ball that his rings cannot fit over his knuckles, it is the Super Bowl ring that carries so much significance. \"It represents the incredible journey it took to get to that moment and how all the sacrifice is worth it when you're champion, the challenges we went through that season and the relationships that were built,\" Allen said. \"I will always remember that locker room. A lot of people remember the run but when I look at my ring, two names immediately come to mind \u2014 Todd Christensen and Lyle Alzado. I think of Tom Flores and Greg Pruitt. I think of my mom and dad and the moments before and after that game.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XIX 1984: San Francisco 49ers\n\nRoger Craig, RB \"I don't like showboating my rings,\" Craig said. \"I'm not a flashy guy. I don't like to be like Liberace or something.\" Craig keeps his rings, including his first, from Super Bowl XIX, locked away in a safe but has had it written in his will that each of his five children will receive a ring of significance. His first three children will each get a Super Bowl ring, his fourth will get his 1980s NFL All Decade team ring and his fifth child will get the ring he covets but hasn't yet received: his Hall of Fame ring. \"I just want them all to have something special from Pops.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XX 1985: Chicago Bears\n\nSteve McMichael, DT \"Baby, let me tell you about the night we got our Super Bowl rings. You think it'd be glorious, right? The 49ers got to get their rings in Honolulu, Hawaii...so I'm thinking, 'Well, this is going to be a big-time thing.' I get the news we are having the ring ceremony at the Holiday Inn in Highwood, Illinois. ... I show up at the dinner and [Bears coach] Mike Ditka is already half in the bag. We're sitting there waiting to get the rings and before we get the ring, he's already passed out in his plate of food sitting at the table with the McCaskeys. They start giving the rings out and I look at it \u2014 and it's a nice ring, diamonds and gold. But I heard the NFL allocates $4,000 per ring, and the owners can put more money into it to make it nicer. How much do you think that ring cost the Bears? $4,000.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXI 1986: New York Giants\n\nBobby Johnson, WR Addicted to crack cocaine, homeless and in need of a fix, Johnson sold his Super Bowl XXI ring. \"I actually asked the man what he could give me for it,\" Johnson said in a 2016 ESPN story. \"He offered me $1,000. I said no because I knew I wasn't going to be able to come back and pay it. Finally, he got down to $250. I said, 'I'll take it.'\" The story has a happy ending. Johnson got sober and he got his ring back \u2014 thanks to the help of former coach Bill Parcells and New York businessman Lee Einsidler \u2014 during an alumni weekend event.\n\nSuper Bowl XXII 1987: Washington\n\nDoug Williams, QB As the the first African American quarterback to start \u2014 and win \u2014 the Super Bowl, the ring signifies so much for Williams. \"You open the case and it's realizing what I had been through and things I had overcome,\" Williams said. He rarely wears the ring, but plans to hand it down one day. When he does wear it, he said: \"They all want to touch it; they all want to put their hands around it and they all say, 'Wow, what a great day. Man I prayed for you. It's bringing back memories for them because it was such a history-making day. The people from where I grew up, it's almost like they wear that ring. That day will never happen again in the history of football; there will never be another first African American quarterback to win.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXIII 1988: San Francisco 49ers\n\nJesse Sapolu, OL It's the only game that was close. That's why Sapolu values and wears semi-regularly the Super Bowl XXIII ring. \"My other three Super Bowls were kind of blowouts,\" Sapolu said. \"This one we had to drive the ball 92 yards to win it at the end of the game.That's when you find out a lot about yourself.\" Sapolu's love for that particular ring didn't prevent him from nearly losing it, though. He doesn't remember the exact date but six or seven years ago Sapolu was in Hawaii working with the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame. He got on an early flight to head home and his heart sank when he discovered he'd left it at his hotel. \"I realized it on the plane,\" Sapolu said. \"That was the painful thing. It was five-hour flight and the whole time I was just worried sick about it. Things were just going through my mind about how hard it was to win that ring and here I am and I might lose it for good. Thoughts of how do I say to the 49ers if I can order another ring or how does the process work and all of those thoughts. I suffered on that flight because you can't reach anybody.\" The story has a happy ending, though, as a maid found the ring and the hotel shipped it back to Sapolu, who still wears it to team events to this day.\n\nSuper Bowl XXIV 1989: San Francisco 49ers\n\nSteve Bono, QB Signed as what he calls an \"expensive insurance policy\" behind Joe Montana, Bono and his teammates' best Super Bowl ring story is as much about how they received them as it is anything that happened after. At the peak of his team's dynasty, former owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. wasn't fond of standard ring ceremonies. Instead, he flew the entire team and their families to Kauai for the biggest, fanciest party you could imagine. \"It was typical Mr. DeBartolo fashion,\" Bono said. \"It was extravagant.\" In addition to the rings, DeBartolo gave all of the players spending money, which Bono said never got spent because DeBartolo paid for everything. The four-night stay included plenty of golf, top-shelf meals and entertainment provided by Huey Lewis and the News. The hardest part? Getting the ring safely back to the mainland. \"I put it on and didn't take it off until I got home,\" Bono said.\n\nSuper Bowl XXV 1990: New York Giants\n\nLawrence Taylor, LB An East Coast collector bought Taylor's ring as part of a collection of championship rings from various sports in a 2012 auction. The sale price \u2014 $230,401 \u2014 is the highest known price paid for a Super Bowl ring from a player. \"It's Super Bowl. It's New York Giants,\" SCP Auctions president David Kohler said. \"And then when it came to Lawrence Taylor, he was the most prominent player on the team. He's LT.\" Taylor originally gifted the ring to his son TJ, who later decided to sell it. Rumor had it that it had been purchased by Charlie Sheen. That turned out to be false. Instead the most expensive Super Bowl ring ever is part of a collection.\n\nSuper Bowl XXVI 1991: Washington\n\nBrian Mitchell, RB A limo, a night on the town and cold weather. It was not a good combination for Mitchell and it nearly led to him losing his Super Bowl ring for good back in 2000. After going out drinking, Mitchell woke up the next morning without his ring. \"When it's real cold, your fingers seem smaller,\" he said. That's why he guessed: Maybe it's still in the limousine. He called the driver who opened the door and found it stuck in the door jamb. \"I was like, 'Ohhhh,'\" Mitchell said. \"But, dude, that's why I don't wear it as much now and, definitely, when I'm going out and hanging with my boys, I don't wear it.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXVII 1992: Dallas Cowboys\n\nDaryl Johnston, FB The only ring that fits Johnston is from Super Bowl XXX. \"I don't know what's happened to my knuckles on my fingers,\" he said. Johnston grew up outside Buffalo, so he doesn't wear rings from Super Bowl XXVII or XXVIII \u2014 wins over the Bills when he goes home \u2014 even though Super Bowl XXVII is his favorite. \"It's understated but it's very, very well crafted,\" Johnston said. \"It's got a star-cut diamond, which at the time had never been done before, so that's my favorite one. It doesn't grab your attention. It looks like a nice class ring, like a larger class ring. Thirty is heavy. It's big. But they put a lot of history of the franchise as part of the design of the ring so it got big because of what the Cowboys accomplished through their history.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXVIII 1993: Dallas Cowboys\n\nDarren Woodson, S When Woodson does a speaking engagement, he has his three Super Bowl rings connected to a chain and passes them to the crowd. \"I tell them I'm the all-time leading tackler for the Dallas Cowboys and I have one more tackle left in me if you try to break for the door,\" Woodson said. His favorite is the ring from Super Bowl XXVIII, which features four marquee diamonds \u2014 for the four Super Bowl wins \u2014 surrounded by 40 small round diamonds. \"The Joneses weren't holding back,\" Woodson said. \"It was, 'We're back-to-back champs,' and the boldness of that ring is what stood out.\" So much so Woodson's oldest son, D.J., has already called dibs on it. He likes the size of the diamonds and it's just a big, tall ring,\" Woodson said. \"It's not just flat. It's a tall ring. It's built differently and the diamonds are sticking up.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXIX 1994: San Francisco 49ers\n\nDennis Brown, DE When Brown and his ex-wife Danielle divorced in 1999, they agreed to pass the Super Bowl ring they'd earned to son Derrick and daughter Darienne. Brown didn't see the ring again until he was working as a part of the 49ers' broadcasting team when the team got back to the Super Bowl in 2013. The team invited Derrick and Darienne to New Orleans for the game. At a dinner beforehand, Brown looked over to see Darienne wearing the ring. \"It was kind of cool because this was my grown son and grown daughter at a Super Bowl wearing my ring,\" Brown said. \"They didn't win that Super Bowl but it was like a full circle.\" Derrick and Darienne intend to make the ring a family heirloom, passing it down for generations and wearing it at their biggest life events, like weddings... or Super Bowls.\n\nSuper Bowl XXX 1995: Dallas Cowboys\n\nNate Newton, G \"Not one. Not two, but three. I got three,\" Newton likes to say, paraphrasing LeBron James' introduction with the Miami Heat. Newton's third ring, from Super Bowl XXX, was bigger \u2014 81 diamonds and five carets \u2014 than the rings from Super Bowl XXVII and XXVIII. \"I don't think mine fits now, it's so big. Everybody tried to order a ring size up to make sure they were huge.\" Newton thinks the Cowboys' Super Bowl XXX started the trend of the oversized ring. \"Super Bowl rings have always been admired but the way Jerry did it, it made the owners take off too. Like him building a stadium made the others take off on stadiums. Our rings might not be more valuable per dollars than the other guys, but we've got the most highly valued of them since we started it and we are not done. Because of what that name means, if we get another one, boy, that will be the glory days again.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXXI 1996: Green Bay Packers\n\nLeRoy Butler, S \"I just hoped it was in the shape of a G,\" said Butler, the All-Pro safety said. \"That G means something to me, obviously Green Bay, but it means greatness and after 30 years of not being in the Super Bowl, we wanted it to be special. When I heard it was a G I was elated, I really was.\" Butler rarely wears his ring and he says he has a good reason. One of his teammates left his ring at an airport security checkpoint and was lucky to get it back. \"That story freaked out a lot of people,\" Butler said.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXII 1997: Denver Broncos\n\nMike Shanahan, Coach Hundreds of folks have had the chance to try on the ring, according to Shanahan, who said he \"never\" wears them. He keeps them in a display case at his suburban Denver restaurant. \"... When I look at that first one ... I see what it takes. You can go through the years and go through the list of people who've played and coached in the National Football League, great players, great coaches, and they don't have one. They don't hand them out for one good effort. You look at it and see skill, luck, big-time plays in big-time moments, but you see the attention to detail and that you have to be a team with that attention to detail, everybody top to bottom, or you're not going to get one. And looking back, when you don't get one and you think you might have had a chance, that is always the difference.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXXIII 1998: Denver Broncos\n\nRod Smith, WR When speaking at events, Smith usually carries his two Super Bowl rings in a bag. \"I've let people wear them when I go to events or speak to groups because people love those things. But I was a family reunion in St. Louis, maybe 10 years ago ... one night I put it in the drawer of the night stand in my room at the hotel, right next to the Bible in there.\" Smith left the hotel with the ring still in the drawer. A 10-year-old boy, staying in the room with his family, found it and alerted the Broncos and got it back to Smith. \"They never wanted anything. They didn't even want an autograph. The dad just said 'We just want to get it to the rightful owner and we just want him to do the right thing.' That's just amazing, that just blew me away. It always will.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXXIV 1999: St Louis Rams\n\nD'Marco Farr, DT \"I remember walking into the Ritz Carlton [to receive the rings] ... Robert Wuhl, the guy that did Arli$$ on HBO, is our emcee, so he's going through the whole spiel, and I'm kind of listening, but kind of not, because we're half drunk and getting drunker as the night goes on. As a matter of fact, one of my teammates, who I won't name, was right behind me and he went from sitting upright to leaning, to on the ground before Robert Wuhl finished the whole spiel, and then he threw up on my shoe. So we got the rings, it was awesome, we opened them up, and it was like 'Wow, here it is.' You won, this is official, it's solid and they can never take that away. We finished that ceremony around 9 p.m., and by midnight, that was the only thing I had on.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXXV 2000: Baltimore Ravens\n\nArt Modell, Owner It took 40 years, but Modell won his first Super Bowl as an owner against the New York Giants. \"But nobody can ever remember him wearing his ring,\" said Kevin Byrne, the Ravens senior vice president of public relations. \"He just wasn't a ring person.\" After Modell died in 2012, his family decided to keep his ring alongside the Vince Lombardi Trophy in a unique arrangement. Every two years, that ring and trophy goes back and forth between his son John Modell and Michel Modell, the wife of the late David Modell.\n\nSuper Bowl XXXVII 2002: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nShelton Quarles, LB At least 1,000 fans have tried on the ring, according to Quarles. \"I meet people at gas stations, car washes, grocery store \u2014 wherever,\" said Quarles, who was with the team for 10 seasons. \"... To this day, I still have people who tried it on the year after we won the Super Bowl and they'll show me pictures.\" He nearly lost it once during a visit to a local prison for ministry in 2003. He let a group of inmates try it on. \"We were just about to leave, and [one of the inmates] started running towards me, and one of the prison guards was chasing him,\" Quarles recalled. \"And I'm like, 'What's going on here?' ... He actually ran me down as I was trying to leave to make sure he returned my ring to me.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXXVIII 2003: New England Patriots\n\nMatt Chatham, LB The three-time Super Bowl-winning linebacker/special teamer had a \"terrifying experience\" with his second ring, which was bigger than his first ring. He took the ring with him to his hometown of Sioux City, Iowa. While driving his rental car back to the airport, he took the ring off, to relieve his swollen hands, and put it in his lap. \"I spaced out and as I arrived at the Omaha (Nebraska) airport, I stepped out of the vehicle to get my bags, and as I stand up, the ring hits the concrete. It was so heavy that it bounced almost waist high. It was a multiple 'Bing! Bing! Bing!' down the road. ... Amazingly, after that scare, all the diamonds held. But it was a moment of terror. After a trip in which you're telling everyone else to treat the ring with care, you're the one who overlooks it.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XXXIX 2004: New England Patriots\n\nChristian Fauria, TE The two-time Super Bowl winning tight end usually kept his rings in the original box. A few years ago, however, there was an extended stretch where Fauria couldn't find them. \"It was weird, because I wasn't really panicking, and I knew I didn't lose them. But I didn't know where I put them,\" he recalled. \"... Somebody asked me to borrow a pen, and I bring the same backpack to work every day. I go into this little pouch that I didn't even know was there. Sure enough, both rings were there in this little pouch that I had been carrying around with for the last year. I was on the air when it happened and I was like 'No wonder my backpack was so damn heavy!'\"\n\nSuper Bowl XL 2005: Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nBill Cowher, Coach After retiring from coaching following the 2006 season, Cowher went on two USO Tours in 2009 and '12. He brought his Super Bowl ring along, but it almost didn't make it back from the '09 tour in Iraq. Cowher let service members try it on and pose for pictures, but it got stuck on a man's finger in Baghdad. \"He put it on and he couldn't get it off. I'm thinking, 'OK, this is not good,'\" Cowher said. \"You are sitting here in Baghdad, Iraq and I'm like, 'We need to get this off.' You get a little bit of grease and everything else.\" The ring eventually came off, but after that, Cowher kept a closer eye on it. If the ring didn't slide over the middle knuckle with ease, he advised folks to not force it. \"It was amazing how much that lifted our soldiers over there,\" Cowher said. \"It meant a lot to them.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XLI 2006: Indianapolis Colts\n\nGary Brackett, LB Losing weight cost Brackett some diamonds from his Super Bowl XLI ring. Brackett put his ring inside his tuxedo jacket because it kept slipping off his finger while he danced at a 2014 charity event. It wasn't until several days later the linebacker realized he misplaced his ring. \"It's one of those feelings where my stomach was empty,\" Brackett said. \"You're saying, 'Oh my god. Did I lose it? Did it drop out my pocket? Did I put it in my pocket? Did it fall off?' My mind was playing tricks on me.\" Nearly a week later an employee from the dry cleaners called to let him know they found his Super Bowl ring in his jacket pocket. Shortly after picking it up, Brackett noticed there were a couple of diamonds missing. Insurance would have covered replacing the diamonds but Brackett decided against it. \"I kind of like the missing diamonds because it's significant of the struggles and pains that you went through in winning the Super Bowl,\" he said. \"The Super Bowl wasn't perfect, so I feel like every time I look at the ring and see it beat up, I put a smile on my face because that's what it took to get there and win it.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XLII 2007: New York Giants\n\nEli Manning, QB As part of a group, which included ownership, coach Tom Coughlin, receiver Amani Toomer and offensive lineman Shaun O'Hara, Super Bowl XLII MVP Eli Manning helped design the ring. Manning remembers they were all set with a classic design, something that wasn't too big and could be worn around. But then defensive end Michael Strahan showed up to give his opinion. \"All I care about is I want a 10-table ring!\" Strahan said. Nobody knew what that meant. Strahan explained when he went into a restaurant, he wanted the ring to be seen from 10 tables away. \"We kind of threw out everything we'd done and started over.\" Manning said. Strahan's final version, a 1.72 carat ring, was all about size and was significantly bigger than what they originally agreed upon.\n\nSuper Bowl XLIII 2008: Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nHines Ward, WR Before Super Bowl XLIII was even played, Ward had a vision of the team's sixth ring. As the senior member of the Steelers that season, Ward was in charge of the design. Before departing for the game, Ward sketched a picture. With six massive diamonds surrounding the Steelers logo, this ring would have more bling than the one designed by Jerome Bettis for Super Bowl XL. As he boarded the charter plane to the game, Ward placed the sketch in team owner Dan Rooney's lap. \"Mr. Rooney, when we win this one, we've got to make sure people on the other side of the room see the ring that we're wearing,\" Ward said. \"It's got to stand out.\" A week later, Ward's ring came to life. \"You can see mine is a little bit bigger than Jerome's,\" Ward said. \"... Every time I get around Jerome, I always wear the bigger one, just to rub it in his face a little bit.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XLIV 2009: New Orleans Saints\n\nLance Moore, WR For one day at least, Moore actually had two Super Bowl rings. The original was stolen from his home in Ohio while he was at training camp (hidden it in his sock drawer). Fortunately he had insurance and had a replica made. His ring was later found at an auction house in New York after it had gone from a pawn shop to a seized storage unit, though police never found out who stole it. The insurance company told Moore he could either pay for the replica or send one back. He sent back the original. \"Just the fact that it had been stolen and changed hands as many times as it had, I didn't want it,\" said Moore, who said he never found out what the insurance company did with it. But, \"I haven't heard of anybody else owning a Lance Moore Super Bowl ring.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XLV 2010: Green Bay Packers\n\nCharles Woodson, DB After winning the NFC Championship, Woodson told his teammates: \"For two weeks, think about one. Let's be one mind. Let's be one heartbeat. One purpose. One goal. One more game. One. Let's get it.\" It's why the number \"1\" along with the words \"mind,\" \"goal,\" \"purpose\" and \"heart\" are inside each ring. \"You see that '1' and the words, and it was like, 'Wow,' you're floored,\" Woodson said. \"When you talk to the team in any capacity, you never know what's going to stick. You try to say something that guys can kind of grab on to. For that to be inscribed on the ring told me that it meant something not only to the players but to the coaches. Now, there's something that we can actually hold onto forever.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XLVI 2011: New York Giants\n\nChris Canty, DE The night before the Giants played the Jets in a must-win game on Christmas Eve, a motivational speaker came in an told the team they had to be \"all-in.\" The speaker even gave them a poker chip to symbolize the commitment. \"That became our rallying cry for the rest of the season,\" Canty said. The Giants beat the Jets, won the following week and went on a magical run to win the Super Bowl. At the wild-card game, the slogan \"all-in\" was on the towels given to fans and it's also inscribed inside of the ring. As for that poker chip, Canty keeps it in the box he got for the Super Bowl ring.\n\nSuper Bowl XLVII 2012: Baltimore Ravens\n\nCam Cameron, OC Two months before the team celebrated its Super Bowl win, Cameron was fired as the Ravens offensive coordinator in December 2012. But after the season, Cameron received a call from team officials asking for his ring size. After being with the Ravens for almost four seasons, he was appreciative of the gesture, and he followed through on a promise to give his first Super Bowl ring to his 92-year-old father. \"I think he's afraid to wear because he's afraid someone will bop him over the head and steal it,\" Cameron said.\n\nSuper Bowl XLVIII 2013: Seattle Seahawks\n\nDerrick Coleman, FB After Coleman lost it, his ring took an interesting and serendipitous road back to him. He left the ring in a rental car in Los Angeles. Then a teammate's agent, David Mulugheta, came across the Tiffany and Co. box in the same rental car. Mulugheta's wife thought it was a gift for her until opening the box. Once they figured it out, Mulugheta gave it to Earl Thomas who returned it to Coleman. \"For a quick second I was like, 'hey man, this might be a real cool fantasy football trophy' ... but I wouldn't,\" Mulugheta said. \"I know how much that means to guys, so that was never a thought.\"\n\nSuper Bowl XLIX 2014: New England Patriots\n\nMatthew Slater, ST The ring might mean more to Slater because football is part of his family's foundation. His father, Jackie, played for the Rams and is in Pro Football Hall of Fame. \"He played for 20 years, making it to one Super Bowl and losing it, and never getting back, I know that was the biggest regret of his career. So I felt like, in a strange way, it was a Slater finally being a Super Bowl champion after 27 years in the NFL combined \u2014 and to share that moment with my dad meant a lot to me.\" It was the Patriots' first Super Bowl win in a decade, and Slater said: \"It was emotional for a lot of us who had been here for a while, just to feel like we finally had a seat at the table, because it felt like we would never measure up.\"\n\nSuper Bowl 50 2015: Denver Broncos\n\nRyan Harris, OT After four seasons in Denver, two in Houston and one with the Chiefs, Harris re-signed with the Broncos and started every game of the 2015 season. \"I got it sized for my middle finger ... You know, the offensive line, leading up to Super Bowl 50, nobody respected us, nobody felt like we would be able to impact the game. ... So, we were getting the rings sized and I was sitting with some of the linemen, and I said 'Let's get it sized for the middle finger.' I think about 'This one's for Pat,' in the inscription ... some of the things coaches told me about the limits of my development ... about the Chiefs, who told me I had no football left, the year before I played for a Super Bowl win. And it is so fun to put that on and let it dangle.\"\n\nSuper Bowl LI 2016: New England Patriots\n\nJustin Coleman, CB When the Patriots put on these rings for the first time, they started high-fiving, which became fist-bumps. Then Coleman heard the clink. Later that night, when he started looking at his name and number on the ring along with staring at every diamond he noticed something was off. That clink? It was really his brand new ring getting chipped. \"I figured out that diamonds chipped diamonds easily,\" said Coleman, who had the ring repaired. \"It's just everything else that don't chip diamonds that easily. But other diamonds do. I'll never fist-pound anyone else with that ring.\"\n\nSuper Bowl LII 2017: Philadelphia Eagles\n\nJon Dorenbos, LS Traded prior to the start of the 2017 season, Dorenbos had been the Eagles' longest-tenured player and a favorite in the organization. A subsequent medical exam revealed Dorenbos had an aortic aneurysm which required heart surgery and ultimately ended his career. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie included Dorenbos in the Super Bowl LII by inviting him to be in the locker room following win and giving him a ring. \"What he did for this community here in Philadelphia, how he represented himself here, even the time we were competing; just such a great mentor,\" said long snapper Rick Lovato, who succeeded Dorenbos in Philly. \"He definitely deserved it, especially after everything that has happened to him, his heart condition. It's crazy everything that happened and we're just thankful that he's alive and that he could be around for that Super Bowl.\"\n\nSuper Bowl LIII 2018: New England Patriots\n\nKenjon Barner, RB Playing five games for the Patriots, and having been released and re-signed three different times, Barner wasn't a major contributor in the championship season (19 carries, 71 yards) and hadn't been with the club since mid-November. So imagine his surprise when he received a text message from an unknown number during 2019 spring practices with the Atlanta Falcons, saying Bill Belichick wanted him to have a ring. \"I was like, 'Is this a mistake? Do you have the right number?' I was speechless,\" Barner said. \"They didn't have to do that.\" Barner let his father, Gary, open the ring when it arrived and he gifted it to his dad as a thank you for his support.\n\nSuper Bowl LIV 2019: Kansas City Chiefs\n\nPatrick Mahomes, QB In normal times, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes would have had his Super Bowl LIV championship ring on a tour of its own. But because of pandemic, he's mostly kept it under lock and key. \"I haven't got to show it off much,\" the Super Bowl LIV MVP said. \"The only people I've really got to show it to is my family, to my mom and dad with them coming up to a couple of the games. Obviously with the COVID pandemic going on, I haven't been able to have a lot of the people up that come every single year. I haven't been able to show them the ring. Hopefully we can get through this and I can show all my friends and family.\"\n\nSuper Bowl LV 2020: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nLavonte David, LB The longtime Bucs captain waited nine seasons to play in the postseason. David's Super Bowl ring -- which was won at Raymond James Stadium and features the field under a top that opens -- represents more than the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. It's a reminder of some of his final memories with his father, Edward Nelson, who died of liver cancer in June 2021. \"That was really tough for me,\" said David, whose mother, Lynette David, died in 2016. \"Everything was so high, and then all a sudden, life just turned around. The good thing is, he loved watching me play football. He was there for me every step of the way since I was in Little League, at every game and at every practice. My joy is coming out here, knowing he helped me get to this point.\" As soon as the confetti started to fall, David said, 'Where's my daddy at?' The two shared a long embrace. \"I just wanted to enjoy that moment with him.\"\n\nSuper Bowl LVI 2021: Los Angeles Rams\n\nVan Jefferson, WR The night the Rams won the Super Bowl was special for wide receiver Van Jefferson because of not only what he and his team accomplished on their home field, but also what happened after the game. During Super Bowl LVI, Jefferson's wife, Samaria, went into labor at SoFi Stadium, something Jefferson didn't know until after the Rams had won. On his way to the hospital, Jefferson watched over FaceTime as Samaria gave birth to their son, Champ. Jefferson said his Super Bowl ring is even more meaningful because of his son's birth. \"When I look at it, I think of my son, and I think of us winning,\" he said.\n\nSuper Bowl LVII 2022: Kansas City Chiefs\n\nMike Danna, DE Since the Chiefs had their ring celebration in Kansas City in June 2023, Danna has barely seen his ring, he said. He took it to his parents' home in Michigan, where it's been ever since and is apparently going to stay. \"It's tucked away at their house,\" said Danna, who was drafted by the Chiefs in 2020, a couple of months after they won Super Bowl LIV. \"Whenever my pops wants to go look at the ring, he goes in there and looks at it. I let them have it. I've just got to go get another one. That one was for them. If I get another one, that one will be for me.\"\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII 2023: Kansas City Chiefs\n\nNick Bolton, LB Bolton hasn't lingered on his LVIII ring much since receiving it at the team's ceremony last summer. He said he cherishes the ring and appreciates the reminder of what he's accomplished in his short career but the bigger priority is where he's going next. \"I got mine and I kept it for about 24 hours or so and after that I put mine up in a bank and a little safety deposit box and kind of moved on with it,\" said Bolton, who joined the Chiefs as a second-round draft pick in 2021. \"It's all about the next one. There's a lot left for me to accomplish in this league.\"",

    "raw_text": "Thirteen times in his NBA career, LeBron James has reached the postseason, and when the story of his career is told, it'll likely begin with the many memorable moments he has created during those 13 trips: eight NBA Finals appearances (including seven consecutive), three championships, three Finals MVP awards, a triple-double average in the Finals ... the list goes on and on.\n\nBut there are other moments -- some you might not know about, and some you might have forgotten -- that help shape LeBron's story, stretching all the way back to the days after he was drafted, right through fashioning the greatest Finals comeback in NBA history. If you're not familiar with these 13 moments, then you're not getting the true full story of the career of LeBron James.\n\nThe (first) summer of LeBron\n\nSummer league wasn't yet a big event in 2003. But that year at the Pepsi Pro Summer League in Orlando, games were moved from a private gym to TD Waterhouse Centre to allow 13,000 fans to catch a glimpse of James playing a meaningless game in an NBA practice jersey for the first time.\n\nOutside the arena, fans swarmed the Cleveland Cavaliers as they arrived in a fleet of SUVs. According to longtime team communications director Tad Carper, it was a \"playoff-like atmosphere.\"\n\n\"You couldn't see who was inside the SUVs and [fans] were tapping on the window and trying to scalp the tickets,\" Carper said.\n\nA week later, at the Reebok Pro Summer League, the Cavs wised up and chartered a bus to take them to the tiny 3,000-seat Clark Athletic Center on UMass-Boston's campus. Summer league organizers arranged for makeshift parking in what Carper remembers as a mixed dirt and gravel lot, which was supposed to be secure from fans who had also parked there.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nSeveral fans hid in the lot by laying on the ground underneath their cars. When the Cavs piled off the bus, the fans rolled out into plain sight, hoping to get an autograph or a picture with James, who was unfazed.\n\n\"I mean, to be honest, man, I had got so much in high school, it wasn't something that was surprising to me or something that I haven't seen before,\" James said. \"I mean, everywhere we went in high school, man, there was people outside our rooms, whether we was in a motel or a hotel, or a Holiday Inn, people was there trying to figure out what the hype was all about. I had seen it so much in high school throughout those last three years that when I got to the NBA, it was like, 'OK.'\"\n\nLunch with a legend\n\nBefore rookie James launched off his left foot and cocked the ball back in his right arm to throw down an instantly iconic dunk in Sacramento, he dug into some chicken fettuccine at the team hotel. It was his last lunch before a legendary run that would include multiple championships and MVP awards, and he was breaking bread with someone who had a couple rings and MVPs of his own: Moses Malone.\n\nThe Hall of Famer, who connected with James through a Nike commercial shoot, visited the 19-year-old's hotel room, shared stories about life in the NBA and offered up advice.\n\n\"It was just about hard work and dedication,\" James said of Malone's message. \"Whatever you give to the game, the game will give back to you. ... That was already in my head, but when you hear it from someone who had accomplished so much, it resonates even more.\"\n\nMalone, whom James would affectionately refer to as \"Uncle Mo,\" was one of the rare greats of the game to embrace him from the very start. His gesture meant the world to James as he transitioned to the pro game.\n\n\"Just the simple fact that he was there,\" James said. \"Just sounded very genuine. I appreciate that day. That was kind of like the beginning of the journey. Sitting in that room, and sitting around with him and sitting with my loved ones. That was the beginning of the journey.\"\n\nA comforting conversation\n\nOn an off day in March 2009, James drove two hours to Columbus to attend a high school championship game featuring his alma mater, St. Vincent-St. Mary, and Thurgood Marshall, a high school in Dayton.\n\nIt was a hotly contested game with James' school ultimately winning by six, but Thurgood Marshall's Juwan Staten, a spark-plug junior guard at the time, scored 28 points in defeat. In the moments after the final buzzer, Staten broke down in exhaustion and grief, holding his head in his hands as he started to cry. He felt someone hug him and start to speak to him.\n\n\"[James] grabbed me close. He told me that he lost a state final his junior year. He told me I was a special player and to keep my head up,\" said Staten, who later went on to play at West Virginia. \"He told me to remember the moment for the rest of my life. He told me to let that drive me for the rest of my life, never to feel like that again. Those were wise words, and I've tried to live by them.\"\n\nThe moment created a remarkable photo, James comforting and offering advice to a teenager in a devastating moment.\n\n\"It's just who I am, I guess. It's not like it was planned. Obviously I just recognized the kid had a lot of talent. He played his heart out against our high school and he wanted to win that game just as bad as, you know, probably living,\" James said. \"And I mean he was just crying, like, a disaster, you know? I've been there. I was in my junior year. ... I just wanted to try to give my words of encouragement in any way I could.\"\n\nThe President and The King\n\nJames has been to the White House for three formal occasions, when President Barack Obama honored his championship teams in 2012, 2013 and 2016. But it was the nonofficial times when James visited that were the most fun for him.\n\nIn 2009, James was in nearby Silver Spring, Maryland, for the premiere of a documentary he produced about his high school years, \"More Than A Game.\" He made a surprise visit to the White House, despite not being on Obama's official schedule for the day. James and friends Rich Paul, Maverick Carter and Randy Mims got a tour of the West Wing and met with Obama in the Oval Office. Obama even made visiting Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi wait a few minutes for a scheduled meeting.\n\nA year later, a few weeks after he signed with the Miami Heat, James returned to the White House as part of what ended up being a historic pickup game to celebrate Obama's 49th birthday. Among those who took part were Kobe Bryant, Grant Hill, Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Magic Johnson, Alonzo Mourning, Chris Paul, Derrick Rose, Bill Russell, Dwyane Wade and David West.\n\nFantasy, but still not reality\n\nJames' feature film debut came in 2015's \"Trainwreck,\" and he has long been rumored to be involved in a \"Space Jam\" sequel. But there's another saga that predates both of those, a decade-old idea to have James star in a movie about a fantasy basketball camp.\n\nIn 2009, after he'd gotten some attention for playing four different versions of himself in Nike ads, James started a project about an adult fantasy basketball camp set in Las Vegas. The script, from established screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, was to be produced by Brian Grazer. It was scheduled to film in 2010 and director Malcolm Lee spent time with James during the 2009-10 season.\n\nBut after The Decision, preproduction stopped. The project stayed dormant for three years. In 2013, Kevin Hart agreed to co-star with James. The movie had a new name, \"Ballers,\" and a new setting, Miami, where James had just won two titles with the Heat. Hart was set to play James' less talented brother. But James left Miami a year later and the project never got off the ground.\n\nAfter \"Trainwreck,\" momentum returned. In 2016, Mark Wahlberg announced on \"The Tonight Show\" that he was going to star in a fantasy camp movie with James and it would be written by Doug Ellin, the creator of \"Entourage.\" Nothing has happened with the concept since.\n\nWill it ever get made?\n\n\"That's still the hope and the idea is still out there,\" James said. \"Kev [Hart] is, well, you can't stop him. The route that he's on right now, he has no time to be stopping and waiting. He's got to stay on that wave. So, you know, we'll see what happens.\"\n\nHanging up No. 23 ... everywhere\n\nMichael Jordan has attended only a few dozen of James' games over the years. But when he sat courtside for one game in Miami in November 2009, James seemed overwhelmed with emotion.\n\nAs he was walking off the floor he whispered to TNT's Craig Sager that he was going to dump his No. 23 to honor Jordan. After the game he doubled down and suggested that the entire league retire Jordan's number. In Miami, Jordan's No. 23 is retired and hangs on a wall on the side of the arena. That night Jordan sat next to Heat president Pat Riley, who had the idea to honor Jordan even though he never played for Miami.\n\n\"He's the best basketball player we've ever seen,\" James said that night. \"If you see 23, you think about Michael Jordan. You see guys flying through the air, you think about Michael Jordan. You see game-winning shots, you think about Michael Jordan. You see fly kicks, you think about Michael Jordan. He did so much, it has to be recognized, and not just by putting him in the Hall of Fame.\"\n\nA few weeks later, James filed paperwork to change his number for the following season. When he signed with the Heat and switched to No. 6, there were some conspiracy theories that James knew he'd be going to Miami and that's why he brought up the number change. James denied that was true, noting he would've had to change his number if he signed in Chicago, where it is also retired for Jordan.\n\nAfter wearing No. 6 for four years in Miami, James switched back to No. 23 when he returned to Cleveland.\n\nAn early meeting with a future rival\n\nIn July 2010, after three days of free-agency meetings with six different teams that were monitored by media and fans like a congressional hearing, James pondered his future at his annual Nike basketball camp at the University of Akron.\n\nThe camp was for elite high school players but also featured some of the nation's top college players serving as counselors. They drew the attention of scouts, playing pickup games that often turned into a \"who's who\" of future lottery talent.\n\nOn the second day of the camp, with the whole basketball world hanging on his free-agency decision, James -- joined by Chris Paul -- showed up in workout clothes ready to play.\n\nJoined by a couple of James' Cavs teammates, they took on a team that featured Dayton's Chris Wright, Georgetown's Vernon Macklin, Butler's Shelvin Mack, Duke's Kyle Singler and a rising junior sharpshooter from Washington State named Klay Thompson.\n\nYes, the first time Thompson faced James and Paul was on a side court in Akron, Ohio.\n\n\"You never know who you're going to cross paths with,\" James said, recalling the game. \"That's why, for me personally, I've always been kind to the younger generation and the kids in high school, the kids in college, the kids growing up. ... I would never want a story to come out about me and them say, 'Man, when I was in the 10th grade, man, I went up to LeBron and he told me you ain't never going to make it and now ...' You know? That's wack for me. To kill a kid's dream before it started? That's wack to me.\"\n\nThompson hit a few long jumpers, and Mack wasn't intimidated going up against Paul, who was recovering from injury. James and Paul won, but it was respectable. And just the beginning.\n\nTaking his two-wheeler to South Beach\n\nWhen James first joined the Miami Heat, there were few figures more reviled in professional sports. Overnight, he went from celebrated in the only home he'd ever known in Northeast Ohio, to perceived as disloyal and afraid of competition by joining up with a superteam in South Beach.\n\nWith his life uprooted, something to prove, and plenty of vitriol to escape, James took up a new pastime: bike riding.\n\n\"Being in Miami it's all about just trying to have a mental edge,\" James said. \"And at the same time, being able to have just a freedom, which is very rare in my life.\"\n\nLongtime friend Randy Mims fashioned stereo speakers on his bike so he could blast music when James and the gang crashed Critical Mass -- a street cycling event held on the last Friday of every month when hundreds of bike riders find the route posted online at the last minute and pedal around Miami together. By the time other bikers realized who was in their presence, James & Co. had usually already zipped past them.\n\nThe practice later inspired both a Nike commercial and James' charitable initiative \"Wheels for Education,\" in which he doled out thousands of bikes, helmets and other gear to children who completed a learning enrichment camp that he sponsored.\n\n\"To be able to just have some freedom,\" James said, looking back. \"And just feel like I was at peace and smell the fresh air and things of that nature and also have a mental edge saying, 'Listen, we're going to use this as conditioning, we're going to use this as a way to get to work.' If I could do this and still go out and play and dominate, it was more of a mental edge for me.\"\n\nThe night Miami ended Linsanity\n\nAt the shootaround before a game in Miami in February 2012, James and Wade got into an argument about strategy for that night's game against the New York Knicks. Both badly wanted to guard -- and shut down -- Jeremy Lin, who had taken the league by storm.\n\nThe cards were stacked against Lin. It was his fourth game in five nights and the Knicks had a tough back-to-back, flying in from New York after beating the Atlanta Hawks the night before. It was the culmination of a historic 11-game stretch that made up \"Linsanity,\" during which he averaged 23.9 points and 9.2 assists and had some breathtaking finishes.\n\nTen days earlier the Heat had laughed and celebrated when Lin hit a game winner in Toronto, with some of the players staying in the locker room in Indianapolis to watch after their win that night. But by that February night in Miami, they were sick of it and wanted to prove a point.\n\nThe Heat smothered Lin in traps and shoved him around, and Lin quickly unraveled. He ended up shooting 1-for-11 with eight turnovers, and the Heat won by 14 points.\n\nJames used his size advantage to push Lin far away from the basket and from teammates. He plucked away five steals of his own and harassed Lin into several other miserable mistakes that unleashed the Heat's fast break.\n\nLater, the New York Times reported that President Obama was so impressed with the performance that he used it as a metaphor for his reelection campaign against Mitt Romney.\n\n\"We're the Miami Heat and [Romney] is Jeremy Lin,\" Obama reportedly told aides.\n\nThe incredible streak within a streak\n\nIn the middle of the 2012-13 season, the Heat won 27 consecutive games, the second-longest streak in NBA history. But lost within that streak was perhaps the hottest regular-season streak James has ever been on.\n\nDuring his time in Miami sharing the ball with stars Wade and Chris Bosh, James wasn't able to get the volume of shots he'd gotten before. So he became more focused on efficiency, making sure the shots he got counted. He hunted cleaner looks, devoted himself to 3-point shooting for the first time, and learned where on the floor he should be positioned to maximize his chances. The result was a soaring shooting percentage, which hit a whopping 57 percent in 2012-13.\n\nDuring the long win streak that season, James had six consecutive games shooting better than 60 percent and scoring more than 30 points. During the core of that run, he went 31-of-41 shooting over three games. His streak ended in Oklahoma City, in a rematch of the previous season's Finals, when James shot only 14-of-24 (58 percent) and scored 39 points in an incredible duel with Kevin Durant, who scored 40 points. The Heat won by 10.\n\nThe following season, James had a streak during which he shot 67 percent or better in five straight games and averaged 37.4 points. It culminated in his career-best 61-point performance against the Charlotte Bobcats, a night he shot 22-of-33 from the field and 8-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nWhen 25,000 fans came to watch LeBron ... speak\n\nJames once had more than 25,000 fans show up just to watch him give a speech. In August 2014, the city of Akron wanted to welcome James back home so it essentially threw a giant rally at the University of Akron's football stadium, which was nearly at capacity, including thousands of seats on the field.\n\nBeforehand, James held a news conference where he nonchalantly announced the Cavs had finished a trade for Kevin Love. The move had been reported but wasn't yet official until James started openly talking about his new teammate.\n\nJames didn't come out to the field until just before dusk, making a slow circle like a boxer coming to the ring as he embraced fans. As he was on the circuit, Skylar Gray appeared on a stage and sang her song \"Coming Home,\" which had become the anthem of James' choice to re-sign with the Cavs.\n\nAfter honoring students supported by his foundation, James waited for the sun to go down before declaring \"I'm back\" and dropping the mic. A surprise fireworks display then started over the stadium.\n\nSpecialized shoes lead to special connection\n\nAaron Miller, who has a rare form of cerebral palsy called spastic hemiplegia that stems from a severe stroke he suffered at birth, was being honored by the Celtics during a timeout in a December 2015 game against the Cavaliers. James looked up at the video board to see the story of how Miller overcame his health hurdles to win MVP in a local basketball tournament associated with the Special Olympics. James then noticed the teenager's footwear.\n\nMiller was wearing a specialized version of LeBron's shoes, designed to be easier to put on and take off, with children with disabilities in mind.\n\n\"I just saw him with my shoes on and picked him out,\" James said. \"I was just ... it was kind of fate.\"\n\nJames walked over to Miller and his family, who were seated courtside, placed his hand on the back of Miller's head and acknowledged his presence, with thousands of Celtics fans all fixing their gaze upon the look of pure joy on Miller's face.\n\n\"I felt amazing because I was that kid that sat in the shadows behind everyone, and I was really shy, but when LeBron noticed me and when I got my award, I just felt like I gained a lot of oomph and notoriety,\" Miller says now, looking back at the experience. \"I just felt important. Like, I'm important to LeBron and that he recognized how amazing I am and how I inspire him. That was really cool.\"\n\nJames later gave Miller his game-worn sneakers and posted a photo of the moment they met on his Instagram account, where the image has garnered nearly 400,000 likes.\n\nMiller, who has dealt with paralysis in the right side of his body, blurred vision and limited brain functionality, will graduate high school in June and enroll in Lasell College in Newton, Massachusetts, in the fall, where he plans to study sports management and help out the basketball team.\n\nHe still has the inspirational message James wrote on Instagram memorized, but now has his own message he hopes will inspire James.\n\n\"Good luck and never give up,\" Miller said. \"Tell him, 'You're an inspiration to me and I have followed you since you honored me.' I look at the sneakers that he gave me every day to give me motivation throughout the day. And he's just a really kind person and every time I watch him it makes me happy. So, something like that. Just say, like, 'Thank you for everything.'\n\n\"He's an inspiration, and he changed my life. Yeah, he changed my life, like, forever.\"\n\nRaw emotion after an emotional loss\n\nThe Cavs had just lost to the Golden State Warriors on their home floor to fall down 3-1 in the 2016 NBA Finals. No team in NBA history had ever come back from that type of deficit with a championship on the line. And Cleveland would need to make that comeback against a Warriors team that won a record 73 games in the regular season.\n\n\"We had a chance to win that Game 4 at home and we let it slip away,\" James said of a game the Cavs led by eight in the third quarter but ended up losing by 11. \"We let Steph and Klay get loose and we let it slip away.\"\n\nFlipping through the channels with his wife, Savannah, after one of the most disheartening losses of his career, James' attention was grabbed by Eddie Murphy's 1987 comedy special \"Eddie Murphy: Raw.\"\n\nWith Murphy cracking his solemn spirit, James whipped out his phone to send a directive to his teammates after he and Savannah were finished \"laughing our ass off.\"\n\n\"As hard as it was, man, I knew how I felt, so I can only imagine how my teammates felt at that moment,\" James said. \"And, s---, it was like, 1:30, 2 o'clock in the morning.\n\n\"I just felt the need before we got on this plane to go out there, to send them a text message and just let them know that, 'Listen, whatever y'all got to do, however y'all feeling, it's cool. Feel as s---ty, feel as bad as you want to, but leave it here. Leave it here and don't bring it on that plane because we got work to do. And if y'all trust me, as y'all leader and y'all feel that, then I'll make sure when we come back home for a Game 6.'\"\n\nThe rest -- Cleveland's first title in 52 years -- is history. But it might not have happened without an assist from Eddie Murphy.\n\n\"It just happened to be on,\" James said. \"It's one of those movies, one of those stand-up shows that if it's on, you stop and you watch it. And it just happened to f---ing be on at that point and time. It was like, it was the perfect timing.\"",

    "raw_text": "Manchester United have already agreed a \u20ac60m move to sign Sporting CP full-back Geovany Quenda in the summer, while three Premier League clubs are looking at signing RB Leipzig attacking midfielder Xavi Simons. The Women's Super League window is now closed, while MLS' transfer window officially opens today. Join us for the latest transfer news, rumors and gossip from around the globe.\n\nTransfers homepage | Done deals | Men's January grades | Women's January grades\n\nTOP STORIES\n\n- Sources: Spurs agree \u20ac60m fee for Tel with Bayern\n\n- Source: Dorgu on brink of \u20ac35m Man Utd move\n\n- Aston Villa chief confirms interest in F\u00e9lix, Asensio\n\nTRENDING RUMORS\n\n- Manchester United have already agreed to sign Sporting CP full-back Geovany Quenda as he eyes a reunion with former boss Ruben Amorim in the summer, says A Bola. Quenda, 17, has caught the eye in Portugal and is a perfect fit for the right wing-back spot in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation. Sporting have him on a contract until 2027, which includes an \u20ac80m release clause, but the report claims that an offer of \u20ac60m was enough to get the deal done.\n\n- RB Leipzig signed Xavi Simons on a permanent transfer from PSG for a fee of \u20ac50m fee (plus \u20ac30m in add-ons) but Manchester City, Liverpool, and Manchester United are interested in landing him in the summer, reports Bild's Christian Falk. The three Premier League clubs are said to be watching Simons situation closely, given his contract only lasts until 2027, and it is reported that the 21-year-old could be acquired with an offer in the region of \u20ac80m. Simons, a standout performer for Netherlands at the last European Championship, is open to another move in the near future.\n\n- Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel is on the radar of Chelsea, according to the Independent. Kobel, 27, has impressed despite Dortmund's poor start to the season, although any move unlikely in January and may wait until the summer. The Blues already have EIGHT goalkeepers on their books -- No. 1 Robert S\u00e1nchez and his backup Filip Jorgensen, but then also Djordje Petrovic, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Marcus Bettinelli, Lucas Bergstrom, Gabriel Slonina and Eddie Beach -- and young Genk star Mike Penders will join next summer. But a \u20ac40m move for Kobel could be an upgrade on all of them.\n\n- Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal are already stepping up their attempts to sign a replacement for Neymar and have made a \"super offer\" for Real Madrid winger Rodrygo, says Marca. Rodrygo, 24, has been unhappy at Madrid in recent years and has been linked with plenty of top clubs, but is a favourite of president Florentino Perez, and the player himself is now keen to stay and succeed at the LaLiga club, despite competition for places. The Brazil international has a contract until 2028 and has scored 67 goals and bagged 47 assists in 245 appearances, but an offer of over \u20ac100m could tempt Madrid as Saudi Arabia look to make him the face of their league ahead of the 2034 World Cup.\n\n- Barcelona are planning a move for Newcastle United midfielder Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, reports TEAMtalk. The Blaugrana are reported to have \"reignited\" their interest in the 27-year-old, and they are keen to sign him in the summer. It is said that they could look to move on midfielder Frenkie de Jong to help make room for Guimar\u00e3es, who has contributed to eight goals in 23 Premier League matches this season.\n\n- Arsenal are weighing up whether to make a second offer to sign Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins, reports the Daily Mail. Watkins, 29, is a boyhood Arsenal fan and would be interested in making the move to London, but Villa are not keen to let him leave as teammate Jhon Dur\u00e1n is set to join Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr for \u00a364.5m. Sources said that Arsenal made an offer (reportedly around \u00a340m) to sign Watkins earlier this week, but the bid was rejected.\n\nCONFIRMED TRANSFERS\n\n- Neymar has confirmed he is returning to Santos. The Brazilian is flying to Sao Paulo to complete his return to his boyhood club and posted several photographs on Instagram, taken on his private plane, with the message: \"After 12 years we are back brother.\" In a video posted on X, he explained the reason why he has chosen to return as \"only Santos can provide me with the care I need to prepare for the challenges I face in the coming years.\"\n\n- Pablo Gavi has signed a new long-term deal at Barcelona until June 2030.\n\n- Bayer Leverkusen have signed defender Mario Hermoso on loan from Roma.\n\n- Fiorentina forward Jonathan Ikon\u00e9 has signed for Como on loan, with a permanent option set at \u20ac8m.\n\n- Paulo Fonseca has been announced as the new head coach of Ligue 1 side Lyon.\n\nICYMI - The WSL window closed yesterday so here's a roundup of the top deals:\n\n- England midfielder Keira Walsh is set to join Chelsea from Barcelona for \u20ac550,000, with the deadline-day move set to be announced soon. Meanwhile, Chelsea announced the signing of Netherlands U19 goalkeeper Femke Liefting from AZ Alkmaar.\n\n- Arsenal confirmed the signing of England forward Chloe Kelly on loan for the rest of the season from Manchester City. And City brought in Arsenal defender Laura Wienroither on loan. Read\n\n- Gotham left-back, and former NWSL Rookie of the Year, Jenna Nighswonger joined Arsenal for around $100,000. Read\n\nEXPERT TAKE\n\nESPN's resident scout Tor-Kristian Karlsen explores why Xavi Simons could move on in six months' time, having just signed for RB Leipzig.\n\nOne of the difference-makers in the German Bundesliga last season, Simons hasn't quite managed to reach the same heights this campaign in a somewhat discontinuous Leipzig side. Even so, the creative midfielder remains among the elite offensive playmakers in the league.\n\nAmong a myriad of attacking skills, the 21-year-old predominantly stands out for his high volume of take-ons (aided by excellent balance and a low point of gravity), a quick instinctive football brain -- he is brilliant at setting up and executing swift combinations -- and his ability to finish from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nUsually positioned in free role, tucked in to the left behind the central attackers, Simons represents a constant threat. Always prompt to receive the ball between the lines, the rhythm of the Leipzig attacks tends to immediately gain pace and urgency when he gets on the ball. Being able to turn quickly when in possession adds a notch of unpredictability with his elevated vision and capability to pick the right movement for a well-calibrated pass or a right-footed shot.\n\nAlways keen to get on the ball, Simons impulsiveness also makes him a target for a tactical foul -- which has resulted in 20+ fouls won in the Bundesliga this season.\n\nThough he has struggled to make the expected impact in the Champions League this campaign, Simons is still the main creative point of reference in the side. While PSG never really gave him a chance, he starred at PSV Eindhoven -- though many worried whether he would cope with the physical transition from the Dutch league to German football. However, those murmurs were soon silenced as he has proven to have a fine attitude and effectiveness in his defensive work too.\n\nOTHER RUMORS\n\nWhy Marcotti thinks Arsenal should go for Vlahovic over Watkins\n\nGabriele Marcotti believes that Arsenal should target Dusan Vlahovic instead of Ollie Watkins after they tabled a bid for the English striker.\n\n- Napoli have given up on their pursuit of Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho after failing to agree a fee; United wanted \u20ac70m and Napoli were only willing to pay \u20ac55m. (Area Napoli)\n\n- Rosenborg midfielder Sverre Nypan, 18, is expected to stay at the club for the rest of season despite being tracked by Arsenal and Man City. (Athletic)\n\n- Al Nassr had a \u00a354m offer to sign 27-year-old Brighton winger Kaoru Mitoma rejected, but will return with a bid worth \u00a390m. (CBS Sports)\n\n- Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba is on the radar of Chelsea ahead of the summer. (TEAMtalk)\n\n- Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins would be open to joining Arsenal this month, but Villa want to keep the 29-year-old and would only consider offers over \u00a360m. (Mail)\n\n- However, if he does leave, Villa would bid to sign Wolves striker Matheus Cunha as his replacement. (Guardian)\n\n- West Ham are closing on an \u20ac18m deal to sign Arthur Cabral from Benfica. (Record)\n\n- Celtic wanted to sign left-back Kieran Tierney, 27, this month but Arsenal blocked the move until the summer. (Telegraph)\n\n- AC Milan are edging close to signing Feyenoord striker Santiago Gimenez for \u20ac35m after the Rossoneri made an improved offer. (Gazzetta dello Sport)\n\n- Spain captain Alvaro Morata could leave Milan just six months after arriving for \u20ac13m from Atletico Madrid and is a target of Turkish giants Galatasaray. (Ansa)\n\n- Borussia Dortmund are interested in Lyon attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki and the 21-year-old could reportedly be signed for a fee of \u20ac22.5m. (Sky Germany)\n\n- Como made an offer worth over \u20ac40m to sign 27-year-old left-back Theo Hern\u00e1ndez from AC Milan, but he isn't interested in a switch. (Gazzetta dello Sport)\n\n- Everton are considering a move for 20-year-old Brighton striker Evan Ferguson. (iNews)",

    "raw_text": "It used to be pretty easy to predict the Premier League table before the season even started. You could just say \"Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham -- in some order,\" and you'd usually be right.\n\nIn five seasons from 2009-10 through 2018-19, those six were the top six, and so they became known as the Big Six. In two other seasons, they all finished top seven, and in one other it was top eight. The only real outlier was the outlier, when Chelsea plummeted to 10th a year after winning the league and Leicester City won the whole thing. This was also the only season during this stretch when a club from outside the Big Six finished inside the top four.\n\nAs if in response to someone showing the world that the Premier League might actually be an open competition that anyone could win, the Big Six followed up 2015-16 by cordoning off the top six in three consecutive seasons. During those years, the average point gap between sixth and seventh was more than eight points. Over those three seasons, only four total non-Big Six teams finished a 38-game campaign with a positive goal differential.\n\nWhat was happening? Per Deloitte's accounting, Arsenal brought in \u20ac445.2 million of revenue during the 2018-19 season. West Ham United, meanwhile, made \u20ac216.4m. Those were the sixth- and seventh-richest teams in the Premier League, and one earned more than twice as much money as the other. Revenue tends to be destiny in European soccer -- or at least it used to be.\n\nSince 2018-19, the Big Six has finished as the top six only one time. An outsider has broken into the top four in each of the previous two seasons. And as of now, Nottingham Forest are tied with second-place Arsenal on points, Newcastle United are tied with fourth-place Manchester City on points and Bournemouth are only one point back of both of them. Oh, and Manchester United are 13th, and Tottenham are 15th.\n\nSo, is the \"Big Six\" officially dead? And if so, what killed it?\n\nTheory No. 1: Everyone else in the Premier League got rich, too\n\nYou've read me write these words before, but the Premier League is, for all intents and purposes, the Super League.\n\nFor the 2022-23 season, per analysis by Kieran O'Connor of The Swiss Ramble, English clubs brought in a combined revenue of \u20ac7 billion. Next closest was the Bundesliga's \u20ac3.8 billion. And if you combined the revenues for LaLiga (\u20ac3.5 billion) and Serie A (\u20ac2.9 billion), those 40 clubs would've still brought in less money than the 20 Premier League sides.\n\nEven with clubs massively cutting back on transfer spending over the summer, Premier League teams still spent more on transfer fees than Bundesliga (second-highest spend) and Serie A (third highest) -- combined.\n\nTaking the summer and the current window together, Brighton have spent more on transfers than every other club in the world. And the net spend for just-promoted Ipswich Town, currently in 18th in the Premier League, is more than net spend of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona -- yes, combined. Or take Nottingham Forest, who signed multiple starting 11s worth of players over the past few seasons, gave the keys to a manager with Champions League experience and told him to just figure it out. And so far, he has!\n\nWith almost everyone in the Premier League spending at levels commensurate with Europe's super-clubs, then obviously the rest of the Premier League is going to improve. Seems pretty obvious, no?\n\nYes, and well, no. Wages tend to be the most powerful predictor of results, while transfer fees have only a tiny correlation with on-field success. And per data from the consultancy Twenty First Group, the ratio of wage spend from the Big Six to the rest of the Premier League hasn't really changed all that much.\n\nIn the 2013-14 season, the wage bill for the average Big Six side was 2.5 times the size of the average non-Big Six side. Last season, the ratio wasn't too different: 2.46 to 1.\n\nTheory No. 2: Everyone else in the Premier League got smarter\n\nThis one pulls in multiple directions. First, it makes the bottom of the league less competitive.\n\nFewer promoted teams are really going for it: selling out -- er, rather buying out? -- and trying to revamp their Championship rosters into a team that can compete in the Premier League. Instead, promoted sides have begun to opt for younger signings who might stay at the club for a while and will retain transfer value but also might not be able to contribute right away.\n\nPromoted clubs now know the risks of overspending on older players -- and the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Regulations essentially force them to think longer term than they used to -- so they view promotion less as a last-chance for glory and more as a, say, short-term revenue infusion. With the parachute payments given to relegated sides, getting promoted, not overextended, raking in a ton of cash, getting sent down to the Championship, and then trying to repeat the process again makes a lot more financial sense.\n\nThis, then, leads to a situation where there are fewer competitive teams in the league. Last season, all three newly promoted sides were relegated, and all three this season are favorites to go down again. The Big Six was always expected to take tons of points from the six matches against the newly promoted teams. But now, so too are all of the other teams.\n\nIf you cut out the promoted teams and the Big Six, you're left with 11 clubs. Of those 11, two of them, Brentford and Brighton, are probably the two best-run clubs in England -- both owned by former professional sports bettors who run their clubs with a top-down mandate to make more objective decisions by using advanced data.\n\nBournemouth, too, have begun to lean in this direction under their new ownership. And according to some underlying data, they're currently one of the best teams in the league:\n\nCrystal Palace seem like they've finally escaped the \"retread British manager treadmill,\" and have become one of the most aggressive Premier League clubs at scouring the Championship for undervalued talent. As I wrote about in my book, \"Net Gains,\" Fulham have always tried to use some kind of analytically informed decision-making process, albeit a frequently dysfunctional one.\n\nThis would all seem to be borne out in the results. Per Twenty First Group, the non-Big Six clubs were inefficient with their wage spend from 2013-14 through 2018-19. You can determine how many points the average team would be expected to win based on their payroll, and non-Big Six clubs were below that average. However, their inefficiency declined with each passing season, and since 2019-20, the non-Big Six clubs have been winning more points than expected based on their wage spend.\n\nExcept, all of that includes these noncompetitive promoted teams, plus the likes of Everton, West Ham, and Wolverhampton -- three poorly run clubs in very different ways. And while data is becoming a much bigger part of the game, it's still vastly overstated how much of an impact these numbers actually have on the way teams are run. And it's not like most of the big clubs aren't hiring some of the best analysts out there, too.\n\nTheory No. 3: This is just a Manchester United story\n\nThere's only one real underperformer among the Big Six, and we all know who it is: Manchester United make as much money as any club, they pay wages that are competitive with every other club, they finished eighth last season and they're currently in 13th.\n\nMan United were the only Big Six club who didn't finish in the top six last season, and when they finished sixth two seasons prior, they did so with a goal difference (zero) that ranked just eighth in the league. Even in their one successful season over the past three, they finished third despite producing only the sixth-best expected goal difference in the league.\n\nOtherwise, this season, four of the Big Six are in the top six. Tottenham aren't there, but despite the growing number of calls for manager Ange Postecoglou to be sacked, they've been quite unlucky in a number of ways.\n\nIt seems like everyone for Spurs is injured -- some of which, sure, can be chalked up to Postecoglou's physical demands -- and they've also just distributed their goals in a very strange way. They've outscored their opponents by 10 goals this season, and yet they're in 15th. Only six teams have a better goal difference and 14 teams have more points. Without an injury crisis, Spurs comfortably finished fifth last season.\n\nTheory No. 4: This is just a Newcastle United story\n\nObviously there isn't a Big Six anymore. There's a Big Seven.\n\nNewcastle is now owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which controls nearly a trillion dollars worth of assets. This makes Newcastle's owners the wealthiest owners in all of professional sports.\n\nIn their first full season under new ownership (2022-23), Newcastle finished fourth. Last season, they finished seventh -- but produced the fourth-best goal difference in the league. This year, they're in sixth place through 22 games.\n\nDuring the heyday of the Big Six, there just wasn't another club like Newcastle in the Premier League -- or really, in all of professional sports.\n\nTheory No. 5: It's everything, and it's all just random, man\n\nSince 2018-19, a couple of larger shake-ups have hit the Big Six. Arsenal have tried to replace Arsene Wenger, who managed the club for 22 years. After a couple of seasons outside the top six, they've reestablished themselves as one of the best teams in the world under Mikel Arteta.\n\nBecause of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich -- under whom all of the club's modern successes occurred -- was forced to sell the club. The new owners, Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, have tried to reinvent the wheel with how they run the club, and while there were some initial struggles, they look like they're back to being one of the top six teams in the league.\n\nAnd Tottenham ... well, Tottenham were always the least likely member of the Big Six. A Golden Generation of players, led by Harry Kane, perhaps the best center forward of the past decade, pushed the club into constant Champions League qualification. That added revenue, plus the construction of a new stadium, solidified their financial status as a top-six club, but now they're trying to build their first competitive team with an obvious superstar like Kane or Gareth Bale at the center of it.\n\nIn other words, all three clubs have needed to spend some time rebuilding, and that has led to a few seasons in which each one fell out of the top six. Although these teams have all finished in the top six only once since 2018-19, they're still quite easily the six most successful Premier League teams since 2018-19:\n\nZoom into the past three seasons, though, and it's not quite as obvious:\n\nBut that does a nice job of summing up the current landscape. Newcastle represent the rise of a seventh uber-rich club. Aston Villa, a club filled with players who would normally be playing for a top team in another country, coached by a guy who you could say the exact same thing about, represent the increased appeal of the salaries in the middle tier of the league. (While midtier Premier League teams aren't spending more relative to the Big Six, they are spending more relative to the rest of Europe.) And lastly, Brighton represent the increased willingness of not-as-rich clubs to try an alternative approach to winning soccer games.\n\nIt might not be long, if it hasn't happened already, until there's a new Big Six: one where Newcastle United replace Manchester United. But that Big Six will be different from the one we're used to.\n\nThe most likely individual outcome to any season will remain: the Big Six is the top six. But thanks to the rise in comparative spending power and a growing number of competent decision-making structures, it's more likely than not that, in a given season, one or two other teams get everything right -- enough transfers hit, enough starters develop at the same time, they find the ideal manager for their collection of talent -- and break the Big Six apart.",

    "raw_text": "The draw for the knockout playoff round of the new-look UEFA Champions League has been made.\n\nBut how does this feed into the round-of-16 ties? When is the next draw? How does it all knit together?\n\nAnd why were those league phase positions so important?\n\nHere's how it all works.\n\nWhich clubs were in Friday's draw?\n\nOnly the 16 teams that finished in positions nine to 24 had an interest.\n\nThe clubs that finished in the top eight and went directly through to the round of 16 were not involved; they kept the same four possible opponents.\n\nClubs finishing 25th to 36th had already been eliminated.\n\nWhat was knockout playoff round draw?\n\nThe teams placed ninth to 16th are seeded and will play at home in the second leg, and are listed second.\n\nBrest vs. Paris Saint-Germain\n\nClub Brugge vs. Atalanta\n\nManchester City vs. Real Madrid\n\nJuventus vs. PSV Eindhoven\n\nFeyenoord Rotterdam vs. AC Milan\n\nCeltic vs. Bayern Munich\n\nSporting CP vs. Borussia Dortmund\n\nAS Monaco vs. Benfica\n\nSo there's no country protection?\n\nCorrect. Clubs from the same country can play each other from the knockout playoff round onward. That's why PSG have been drawn to play Ligue 1 rivals Brest.\n\nIt was also possible to draw one of the eight teams you'd already faced -- including the most recent opponents from Matchday 8.\n\nWhat dates are the knockout playoff round?\n\nFirst legs: Feb. 11-12\n\nSecond legs: Feb. 18-19\n\nEach club will play once on a Tuesday and once on a Wednesday.\n\nSo what about the top eight clubs?\n\nAfter the knockout playoff round draw, the teams who finished inside the top eight still have four possible opponents in the round of 16.\n\nFor instance, Liverpool and Barcelona, who finished first and second in the league phase, are able to play any of 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th (PSG, Benfica, Monaco and Brest). This is because Liverpool and Barcelona could yet be drawn into either half of the bracket, but only into the specific paths for those fixtures.\n\nOnce the knockout playoff round is complete and two of those clubs have been knocked out, Liverpool and Barcelona would have two possible opponents remaining: the winners of the knockout playoff round ties.\n\nPossible round of 16 ties:\n\nLiverpool or Barcelona will play one of the winners of:\n\nBrest vs. Paris Saint-Germain\n\nAS Monaco vs. Benfica\n\nArsenal or Internazionale will play one of the winners of:\n\nJuventus vs. PSV Eindhoven\n\nFeyenoord Rotterdam vs. AC Milan\n\nLille or Aston Villa will play one of the winners of:\n\nClub Brugge vs. Atalanta\n\nSporting CP vs. Borussia Dortmund\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid or Bayer Leverkusen will play one of the winners of:\n\nManchester City vs. Real Madrid\n\nCeltic vs. Bayern Munich\n\nWhat does the bracket look like?\n\nThe teams in the knockout playoff round are now set in their half of the bracket.\n\nFor instance:\n\nMan City and Real Madrid cannot play Bayern Munich until the final, as they are in opposite halves.\n\nBut Real Madrid and Man City know that Juventus and PSV are in the same path of the bracket through to a potential quarterfinal tie.\n\nThe top half of the knockout playoff round bracket looks much stronger than the lower half.\n\nWhen is the draw for the round of 16?\n\nThe round-of-16 draw takes place on Feb. 21, when Liverpool and Barcelona would simply be drawn into opposite halves of the bracket -- which would automatically create a fixture against one of the winners of the ties involving Brest vs. PSG and Monaco vs. Benfica.\n\nThe teams placed first to eighth are seeded and will be at home in the second leg.\n\nFirst legs: March 4-5\n\nSecond legs: March 11-12\n\nThe knockout bracket is now set through to the final. There is no draw for the specific ties of the quarterfinals and semifinals.\n\nWho gets home advantage in the quarterfinals and semifinals?\n\nThere will be one more draw, straight after the round of 16 is set on Feb. 21, to determine the home teams in the second leg for the quarterfinals and semifinals.\n\nThis is not done on league phase seeding, so the final league placings did not give a team home advantage beyond the round of 16.\n\nCan January signings play in the Champions League?\n\nYes, clubs are able to make three changes to their official Champions League squad.\n\nSo, if a club sign four players in the January transfer window, they would not be able to register all of them from the knockout rounds of European competition.\n\nThe new list must be submitted by Feb. 6.\n\nThe overall limit of 25 players remains. If a club want to add a new signing, they must remove someone else.\n\nWhy did it matter where you finished in the table?\n\nThe league placings created the knockout bracket, and the new \"seeding\" system means the highest-placed teams can't face each other until the latter stages of the knockout round.\n\nFor instance, if we look at the final table, Liverpool and Barcelona finished first and second and can't play each other until the final. The teams in third and fourth -- Arsenal and Internazionale -- can't play Liverpool or Barcelona until the semifinals.\n\nHowever, the value of being placed high in the table has been complicated by poor European seasons for Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid, who unexpectedly became possible opponents earlier in the knockout rounds.\n\nIndeed, with Man City finishing 22nd, it's created a heavyweight tie in the knockout playoff round, as they must face 11th-place Read Madrid.\n\nPSG, meanwhile, will have to face Barcelona or Liverpool in the round of 16 if they get through.",

    "raw_text": "Real Madrid and Manchester City now know the cost of failing to perform in the reshaped Champions League: a titanic win-or-bust clash between the last two European champions simply to claim a place in the Round of 16. Welcome to the Champions League Playoffs!\n\nAfter the nail-biting conclusion of the competition's first League Stage, some of Europe's biggest clubs have unexpectedly found themselves facing a two-legged knockout fixture to reach the Round of 16.\n\nAnd while Man City vs. Real is the undoubted tie of the round, fellow heavyweights Bayern Munich, Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and last season's Europa League winners Atalanta must also negotiate tricky ties to make it into the next round.\n\nWith UEFA adopting a new tennis-style draw that operates two separate paths (Silver and Blue) to the final, the bracket after the Playoff draw has opened up a clear route to the Champions League final in Munich at the end of the season.\n\nSo what are the Playoffs, and how will they play out?\n\nSILVER PATH\n\nClub Brugge vs. Atalanta\n\nClub Brugge sealed their place in the Playoffs with a game to spare after wins against Aston Villa and Sporting CP while also holding Juventus to a draw, but the Belgian club almost shocked Manchester City on matchday eight by taking the lead at the Etihad and going close to eliminating Pep Guardiola's team before eventually losing 3-1.\n\nBrugge will be underdogs against Atalanta, however, with Gian Piero Gasperini's team becoming one of the most consistent teams in Europe. Their Europa League final win against Bayer Leverkusen last season underlined their quality and they are a team with plenty of goals from Ademola Lookman, Charles De Ketalaere and Mateo Retegui.\n\nWINNERS: Atalanta\n\nManchester City vs. Real Madrid\n\nIt's the nightmare draw for both clubs: the Champions League winners of 2022 against the 2023 champions. On the last three occasions City and Real have met in the knockout stages, the winners of the tie has gone on to win that season's competition.\n\nThis is Erling Haaland vs. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Pep Guardiola going against Carlo Ancelotti and a tie that could be won by any of Phil Foden, Jude Bellingham, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior or Kevin De Bruyne. It is an epic clash, but Real will go into the tie as favourites. They sit on top of La Liga and Mbappe is now beginning to hit top form, while City continue to underperform in the Premier League and seemingly can't keep a clean sheet against top opposition.\n\nExpect fireworks!\n\nWINNERS: Real Madrid\n\nJuventus vs. PSV Eindhoven\n\nPeter Bosz's PSV proved themselves to be a dangerous outsider during the League Stage, winning four games including a matchday eight win against Liverpool that ended the Premier League leaders' 100% winning start to the Champions League season. The loss of leading scorer Ricardo Pepi to a knee injury that will rule the USMNT forward out of this tie could be decisive, however. PSV simply have to find a way to replace his goal threat.\n\nJuventus have blown hot and cold so far, but their 2-0 win against Man City in December highlighted their threat on a night when Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah came off the bench to seal Juve's win.\n\nWINNERS: Juventus\n\nBrest vs. Paris Saint-Germain\n\nBrest made a stunning start to their first-ever European campaign by going unbeaten in the Champions League until a 3-0 defeat in Barcelona in November, but the wheels have started to fall off for Eric Roy's team. While their performances have taken a dive, PSG have found form and their qualification was down to two huge wins against Manchester City and Stuttgart in the final two games.\n\nOver two legs, it's difficult to see anything but a comfortable win for PSG against their fellow French opponents, especially as Luis Enrique's team sit unbeaten at the top of Ligue 1 -- 19 points clear of eighth-place Brest, who have lost nine league games already this season.\n\nWINNERS: Paris Saint-Germain\n\nBLUE PATH\n\nSporting CP vs. Borussia Dortmund\n\nPortuguese champions Sporting looked to be cruising towards a top eight finish when a Viktor Gy\u00f6keres hat-trick helped seal a 4-1 win against Manchester City on matchday four, but coach Ruben Amorim then left for Manchester United and Sporting slid down the table with three straight defeats until Conrad Harder's late equaliser against Bologna on matchday eight saved the team from elimination.\n\nBut while Sporting have struggled to overcome Amorim's departure, Dortmund are also in the midst of a crisis, with Niko Kovac becoming their third coach in less than 12 months after replacing the fired Nuri Sahin this week.\n\nDortmund reached last season's final before losing to Real Madrid, but they have been poor domestically this season. They will be favourites, but this tie could depend on the form of Gyokeres and Dortmund's leading scorer, Serhou Guirassy.\n\nWINNERS: Borussia Dortmund\n\nCeltic vs. Bayern Munich\n\nBayern will have breathed a huge sigh of relief after being paired with Celtic, knowing they could have faced either the Scottish champions or Manchester City.\n\nBy reaching the Playoff round, Celtic have exceeded expectations and last October's 7-1 defeat against Borussia Dortmund at Signal Iduna Park will be a warning of what can go wrong for Brendan Rodgers and his team against Bayern.\n\nCeltic can be a tough prospect at Celtic Park, but Bayern will be too strong; Harry Kane & Co. also have the added incentive of knowing that this season's final will be staged at the Allianz Arena, which could mean Celtic end up routed by the Bundesliga leaders.\n\nWINNERS: Bayern Munich\n\nFeyenoord vs. AC Milan\n\nFeyenoord have been one of the surprise teams of this season's competition, showing that they have successfully moved on from coach Arne Slot's departure for Liverpool last summer. But this tie could all depend on the outcome of Milan's attempts to sign Feyenoord's leading goalscorer Santiago Gim\u00e9nez, with talks at an advanced stage over the Mexico international's potential transfer.\n\nWithout Gimenez, Feyenoord might lack the firepower to beat Milan, but Brian Priske's team will still be tough to beat at the intimidating De Kuip Stadium. Milan are arguably the weakest of Italy's four remaining teams in the competition, so Feyenoord could yet pull of a shock.\n\nWINNERS: Feyenoord\n\nAS Monaco vs. Benfica\n\nMonaco and Benfica finished mid-table, one place apart and only separated by goal difference in favour of the Portuguese team, so this tie is as close as you could imagine. Adolf Hutter's Monaco are young and inconsistent, while Bruno Lage's Benfica are exciting but prone to defensive mistakes: just watch the highlights of their incredible 5-4 home defeat against Barcelona for evidence of their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe experience of World Cup winners Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Angel di Maria is likely to give Benfica the edge in this tie, especially with the second-leg taking place at Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.",

Henderson's prolific production is indelible: The goal of the sport is to score the most runs, and Henderson did that 2,295 times -- more than anyone, ever.\n\nAnd yet as incredible as Henderson was for his accomplishments as a player -- for stealing a record 1,406 bases, for hitting with power, for his physicality -- he was almost as renowned for his personality, his style, his irrepressible confidence and devotion to each game.\n\nHenderson died on Dec. 20, five days shy of his 66th birthday, and this Saturday, he will be honored in a celebration of life at the Oakland Arena.\n\nThose who knew him are saturated with stories about the Hall of Famer, about his devotion to excellence, his acumen, his persona and those moments when he transcended the sport. \"The legend of Rickey Henderson still lives on through the numbers of the game,\" said Cameron, \"and the legendary stories.\"\n\nHere are just a few.\n\nThe art of the steal\n\nIn 1988 -- although similar conversations undoubtedly took place throughout the 1980s, a decade in which Henderson wrecked conventional managerial strategy -- then-Baltimore Orioles manager Frank Robinson said before a game in Oakland that he told pitchers and catchers to not even bother attempting to keep Henderson from running if he got on base.\n\n\"Why should we even try to throw him out? We're never going to get him, and we might throw it away trying to get him,\" Robinson said. \"Don't even try to get him. He's too good.\"\n\nOf course, Henderson walked to start the first inning that day, and stole second ... without a throw.\n\nFormer Texas Rangers manager Bobby Valentine landed similarly. \"We used to talk about two outs, nobody on, ninth-place hitter at the plate,\" Valentine said of a hypothetical game situation. \"Walk him, hit him, let him get on first base [in front of Henderson] because it just wasn't fair when Rickey got on first and no one was on in front of him. It wasn't fair to the catcher.\"\n\n\"He was unbelievable in the '80s. Oh God. Rickey stopped the game with everything he did. He stopped it walking to the plate. He stopped it when he'd take a pitch. He stopped it when he hit a pitch. He stopped it when he got on base. He was wonderful to watch, except when you knew he was beating your ass.\"\n\nManager Tony La Russa had Henderson his dugout across seven seasons -- but also saw from across the diamond.\n\n\"I managed my first 10 years against Rickey, and managing against Rickey was terrorizing. You care about winning the game, as we all do, you were so nervous in a close game, a one-run game, up one, down one, tie game, and in my lifetime, the most dangerous player of our time was Rickey Henderson. He had this miniscule strike zone. If you threw it in there, he'd hit it. If you didn't throw it in there, he'd walk, and it was a triple. He would walk, steal second and third and score on a weak ground ball. We called them Rickey Runs.\"\n\nCameron had always been a base stealer in his rise to the majors and felt he understood the art, but Henderson gave him a more enhanced view. With a right-hander on the mound, Cameron had been taught to look for the collapsing right leg as the first move. Henderson narrowed that focus: The back heel. With left-handers, watch his left shoulders.\n\nRaul Ibanez recalled how Henderson seemed to have the tell on every pitcher's pickoff -- some bit of body language that betrayed whether the pitcher was going to throw the ball to the plate, or to first base. And if a pitcher appeared whom Henderson had never seen before, he would go to the end of the first base dugout and watch until he found the tell.\n\nIf Henderson played in this era, former manager Buck Showalter said, \"with the rules we have now, he would steal 200 bases ... There was a science to what he was doing, he knew exactly how many steps it took to reach second base. And you never knew when he was going. Runners always have a slight bend to the knee right before they were going. Rickey's knee never buckled. He's the only one I've ever seen who was like that.\"\n\nLa Russa noted, \"They did everything they could to not let him beat them. He was a marked man. All the different strategies to beat him -- waiting him out, slowing him down on the bases, he defeated all of them. People tried to intimidate him. My favorite phrase is the one I used years ago: 'You can't scare him. You can't stop him.'\"\n\nHow he saw the game -- on and off the field\n\nHenderson's stance at the plate was unique, a low crouch that turned his theoretical strike zone into the size of a QR code. \"I just remember how difficult it was to make a tough pitch to him with his small strike zone,\" All-Star pitcher Roger Clemens said.\n\nCameron once asked him how he could hit so well from that stance. \"That's how Rickey see the game,\" Henderson replied. \"I see the game small.\"\n\nEverything Henderson did on the field came with his own trademark style. When he thought he hit a home run, he'd pull the top of his jersey -- pop it. He ran low to the ground, moving with peak efficiency, and slid headfirst, like a jet landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier. He'd catch routine fly balls swiping his glove like a windshield wiper.\n\nAnd the panache carried off the diamond, too. Cameron recalled how Henderson always walked into the clubhouse beautifully attired. Dress slacks, silk dress shirt tucked in. When Cameron and teammates went to Henderson's room to play cards or dominoes, he would greet them at the door wearing the hotel robe and slippers.\n\n\"He had his flair,\" La Russa said, talking about the time he managed against him. \"It didn't bother me as long as it was normal and natural. What bothered me is when he would get on first, steal second and third, and score on a ground ball. That's what bothered me.\n\n\"His schooling was limited,\" La Russa continued. \"He did not have a classic education. He talked in the third person. People did not understand. Rickey's IQ is not just a baseball IQ. Rickey is a very intelligent guy. If you're around him, you realize how smart he is.\"\n\nHenderson didn't talk a lot during games. \"He might've talked to the umpires more than [to] anyone else,\" Mariners teammate Alex Rodriguez noted. And his interaction with the umpires was more of a monologue, as longtime umpire Dale Scott remembered. If Henderson disagreed with a strike call, he was apt to say: \"Rickey don't like that pitch.\" Then he would move on and concentrate on the next pitch.\n\nHenderson was ejected 11 times over his long career, and nine of those were about disagreements over the strike zone, but he was not a serial whiner, Scott said he thought. \"He never went goofy on me,\" Scott said. Whether he was at the plate or on the bases, he talked to himself -- maybe to push himself, maybe to heighten his focus. A pitch could be thrown outside and Henderson might say out loud, 'Rickey's not swinging at that.'\"\n\nHe was a challenging player to umpire, Scott recalled, because of his speed, his acute understanding of the strike zone and the way he crouched in his stance. Bill Miller, who was in his early days as an umpire as Henderson's career neared its end, guesstimated that Henderson probably had more high strikes called on him than anyone because of his setup at the plate. When Scott worked the bases, he knew every infield ground ball hit off Henderson's bat carried the potential of a bang-bang play at first, and every time he reached base, there were bound to be pickoffs or close safe/out calls on attempted steals, with Henderson crashing into bases to beat throws.\n\n'Fueling the machine'\n\nThose around Henderson were awed by his incredible physical condition and the methods he used to stay in shape.\n\nTim Kurkjian once asked him how he got so strong. \"You must lift weights all the time,\" Kurkjian said.\n\n\"Never lifted a weight in my life,\" Henderson said. \"Pushups and sit-ups. That's all.\"\n\nCameron backed this up: \"I never saw him lifting weights. The prison workout: Pushups and sit-ups. And a hand grip.\"\n\nShowalter said, \"I was driving home from a spring training game and I saw Rickey leaving a vegetable stand with three bags of vegetables in his arms,\" Showalter said. \"He took immaculate care of his body, I don't think he ever drank. He didn't eat at McDonald's; he went to a vegetable stand. He was fueling the machine.\"\n\n\"He was a very physical runner and slider,\" Showalter said. \"He had different gears. He was like an airplane coming for a landing, leaning forward while accelerating. The end of the runway was the bag. I never saw him slide off the bag. He took a beating with all the sliding he did. Guys tried to pound him on tags. They'd block the base. He'd just smile at them as if to say, 'You can't hurt me.'\"\n\nIn A.J. Hinch's rookie season, 1998, he wore No. 23 and Henderson wore 24, so they lockered next to each other. At the All-Star break, they happened to be on the same flight to Phoenix. \"I hear him call out with his raspy voice and his cackle for a laugh,\" he recalled. \"I sit in the aisle seat in the exit row and Rickey is in the window seat. We land in Phoenix, and as we get off, Rickey asked me where I was going. I told him my girlfriend is at baggage claim, to pick me up. He said, 'No, why are you walking? Rickey doesn't walk. Rickey needs to save his legs.'\n\n\"So we were there for five minutes. Ten minutes. Twenty minutes. Almost half an hour, and then a courtesy cart came to get us at the gate. He wouldn't let me leave so he could save his legs. That was his way of teaching me to be a big leaguer.\"\n\nLa Russa said, \"It is remarkable how often he stayed off the disabled list with the pounding he took. What I learned is that when Rickey said he couldn't go, he couldn't go. When he could feel that his legs were getting tight, they were vulnerable, he would take a day off. It wasn't that he didn't want to play, he knew his legs and body well enough that it was smarter to give them a day for sure. I learned to appreciate that.\"\n\nCameron once asked him how he could slide headfirst throughout his career without getting overwhelmed by the pounding, and Henderson held up his hands. His fingers pointed in different directions \"and looked like spiderwebs,\" Cameron said. \"I don't know how he hit so well, with his hands beaten up like that.\"\n\nThere was a game in that 2000 season when Henderson's back was sore, Rodriguez recalled, and the Mariners played into the bottom of the 13th, with Henderson due to hit leadoff. \"He would go an entire game and not say a word to anybody,\" Rodriguez remembered. \"The top of the 13th ends, and I'm hustling to the dugout to get ready to hit, and Rickey waves me down.\"\n\nAs Rodriguez related the memory, he moved into an imitation of Henderson's distinctive voice, as so many of his teammates and friends do. \"Hey, hey, Rod,\" Henderson said to Rodriguez, mixing in his trademark third-person usage of his own name. \"Listen -- Rickey's back hurts. I'm going to walk, and I already talked to [David Bell] -- he's going to move me over. Make sure you get me in. Rickey don't get paid for overtime.\"\n\nFacing a young Roy Halladay, Henderson singled. When Bell dropped a bunt, Henderson beat the throw to second. Rodriguez singled to load the bases, and then Edgar Martinez ended the game with another single. \"Now that's what I'm talking about!\" Henderson said happily, as the Mariners celebrated. \"Now let's go get in the hot tub.\"\n\nHenderson, the teammate\n\nWhen Henderson was traded from the New York Yankees back to the Oakland A's in 1989, Henderson \"was very conscious of the perception that he was not a great teammate -- an 'I/Me' guy,\" La Russa recalled. \"He was very sensitive to the perception that he was egotistical. He was expressive to the point that he was all about the team. That perception was totally shot. When he came to our team, he made a great team the greatest team ever. We divided the pressure around here.\n\n\"Talk to anyone he played with, and he played with a lot of teams, there wasn't a superstar part of his attitude in the clubhouse, the dugout, the planes, on the buses, He was beloved. When you hear noise in the clubhouse, it was Rickey laughing, he was always in the middle of everything. That truth is not always recognized by fans. Before he played for us, I had no idea he was that way. You see all the flair. But he never played the superstar card with his teammates.\"\n\nHenderson was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993, joining, among others, Paul Molitor. \"There are guys, when you play against them, that you don't care for them, their act or their gait,\" said Molitor. \"When Rickey came to Toronto, I changed 180 [degrees] with him. We had a pretty good team when he got there, but I found that he loved to be a part of a team, he loved to win. He made no waves whatsoever.\"\n\nIbanez idolized Henderson while he grew up, mimicking the way Henderson caught and threw as one of the very few major-leaguers who batted right-handed but threw left-handed, and during the 2000 season, Ibanez played with him. \"One of my favorite teammates I've ever had,\" Ibanez said. \"Hilarious. Thoughtful.\"\n\nIbanez often watched Henderson in batting practice, working through his swing among teammates like Edgar Martinez, making adjustments, sometimes talking to himself. \"Rickey is trying to hit like Edgar,\" Henderson once said. \"Rickey can't hit like that.\"\n\nHenderson's pronunciation of Ibanez's first name always included an emphasis on the 'h' sound in the middle -- Rah-houl -- and Ibanez remembers him being open with advice, and instilling confidence from his own bottomless well of it. \"Once you get the opportunity,\" Henderson rasped to Ibanez, \"you're going to hit, Rah-houl.\"\n\nYoung players loved Henderson, recalled Bruce Bochy, who once managed Henderson when he played with the San Diego Padres: \"Rickey would play cards and dominoes with them before games, and on the plane.\" When the Padres acquired All-Star slugger Greg Vaughn before the 1997 season, and in those days before the National League adopted the DH, Bochy was concerned about how Henderson would handle the situation -- two very accomplished left fielders. \"I bring Rickey into my office to tell him about the box I'm in,\" Bochy remembered. \"He looked at me with understanding and said, 'That's OK. All Rickey ask is that you let him know when he's playing the night before.\"\n\nProblem solved.\n\nHenderson's communication with Piniella was a little different. Among his players, Piniella was known as a hard-ass, to the degree that Cameron's instinct to run on the bases was curtailed to preempt a possible chewing out from his manager. When Henderson arrived, Cameron recalled, it was his presence that loosened Piniella, the two of them jabbing verbally at each other while those around them laughed. At one point during the season, Piniella gave Henderson a couple of days off, and Henderson lobbied for a return to the lineup. \"Hey, Sweet,\" he called out to Piniella in the dugout, using Piniella's nickname. \"Rickey don't know about two days off. Rickey's legs are good.\"\n\n\"They should be good,\" Piniella retorted with some friendly sarcasm. \"You couldn't move before.\" Henderson \"was the only one,\" said Cameron, \"who could talk s--- to Lou.\"\n\nIt wasn't always clear to some of Henderson's teammates if he actually knew their names. Hinch played with Henderson in Oakland, and later in Hinch's career, when he was with the Kansas City Royals and Henderson was with the Boston Red Sox, some of Hinch's teammates doubted Henderson would remember him. \"So here we are at Fenway Park about to go out for pregame stretching telling Rickey stories,\" Hinch wrote in a text response, \"when Roberto Hernandez\" -- the Royals' closer -- said there's no way Rickey knows my name.\"\n\n\"I tried to convince him and the others that my locker was next to his. I had scored a lot for him as the nine-hole hitter and him leading off. I had flown with him. I had worked out in the offseason with him at the complex. Yet they were not convinced. Roberto put his money where his mouth was and told me he had $1,000 if Rickey referred to me by name when we went out there. I asked if it counted if he used any initial -- JP, DJ, PJ, AJ, any of them. Roberto said, 'Nope, has to be A.J.'\"\n\n\"We head out and I go directly to left field and give Rickey the bro hug in front of Roberto and he says, 'A.J., my man, how are you?' HE NAILED IT. When I got back to my locker, I had 10 $100 bills in my chair.\"\n\nHe might not have talked much with teammates during games, but he was talking constantly -- in the direction of fans, to himself. Playing center field, Cameron could hear Henderson at his position, just talking out loud: Hey, hey, hey! Baby!\n\nHenderson was a leadoff hitter through his career, but Cameron would see him in the clubhouse only minutes before a game, finishing a game of spades, or pluck. \"Never in a hurry,\" Cameron remembered. And then he would start to stretch. Cameron, batting second, once called out to his friend from the on-deck circle as the home plate umpire began to look for the first batter: \"Hey, Rick, they are ready for you!\"\n\nHenderson responded smoothly, \"The game don't start until Rickey goes to the plate.\"\n\nHenderson's place in history\n\nDuring Henderson's chase for Lou Brock's record for career stolen bases, the two became friends. \"Close friends,\" Brock said. \"I really liked Rickey. I loved how much he cared about the game, about winning.\"\n\nWhen Henderson broke Brock's record, he famously pulled third base out of the ground, held it toward the sky and proclaimed, while being interviewed on the public address system at the Oakland Coliseum, \"Today, I am the greatest of all time!\"\n\nThat was not the plan.\n\n\"Together, Rickey and I wrote a speech that Rickey was supposed to read after breaking the record,\" Brock told Tim Kurkjian 20 years ago. \"He said he would carry it in his uniform pocket, and have it ready for when he broke the record. When he broke the record, he got caught up in the emotion, and just said what he said.\"\n\nBrock, who was not angry or upset, called Henderson after the game.\n\n\"Rickey, the speech?\" Brock asked. \"What happened to the speech we wrote?\"\n\nHenderson said, \"Sorry, Lou, I forgot.\"\n\nThis was on May 6, 1991. Henderson's career continued for another dozen seasons.\n\nAccording to stat guru Craig Wright, Henderson drew 2,129 unintentional walks, the most in history. An amazing 796 times, he drew a walk to lead off an inning, almost 200 more than any other player. There are 152 players in the Hall of Fame elected as position players who played in at least 1,500 major league games. Sixty-eight of them (45%) drew fewer intentional walks in their careers than Henderson did just leading off an inning. \"And one of them,\" said Molitor, \"was in the bottom of the ninth in Game 6 in '93.\"\n\nIn that Game 6 of the World Series, Henderson and the Blue Jays trailed the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5. Henderson walked. Paul Molitor singled. Joe Carter hit a walk-off three-run homer.\n\nLate in the 2001 season, Henderson closed in on Ty Cobb's record for runs scored, and Padres teammate Phil Nevin wanted to be the guy who drove him in. Nevin missed opportunities, and in the first inning of the Padres' game on Oct. 4, 2001, Henderson flied out. Nevin -- the Padres' cleanup hitter -- told Henderson he should get himself on base the next time and he would drive him in.\n\n\"You missed your chance yesterday,\" Henderson responded. \"Rickey is going to drive Rickey in, and I'm going to slide across home plate.\"\n\nIn the bottom of the third inning, Henderson pulled a ball that hit off the top of the left-field fence and caromed over the wall, a home run -- the 290th of the 297 Henderson hit in his career. With teammates gathered at home plate to greet him, Henderson slid into home plate, feet first.\n\n\"He was so misunderstood because of the speech he made after breaking Brock's record, when he said, 'I am the greatest,'\" Nevin said. \"People thought he was a selfish guy, who couldn't remember anybody's name. But he was a great teammate.\"\n\nSaid La Russa: \"With Rickey ... there's no doubt you can get to that greatest list of all time, with Willie [Mays] and Hank [Aaron], and Rickey is right in the middle of it. He is right on that club. That's his greatness. He compares to all of them, Babe Ruth, all of them.\"\n\nSaid Valentine: \"He's the best player I've ever seen. Up close and personal, in the late '80s, my goodness, how could anyone be better? I don't know how anyone could be better.\"\n\nHenderson played his last major league game on Sept. 19, 2003, and was voted into the Hall of Fame in 2009. Twenty-eight writers did not vote for Henderson.\n\nMyth and legend\n\nThe stories about Henderson were voluminous, with some of them seeming improbable, incredible. Henderson made an appearance on ESPN's morning radio show \"Mike and Mike\" and was asked about the veracity of a handful of the legendary anecdotes -- a game of true or false.\n\nWas it true, Henderson was asked, that he once called Padres GM Kevin Towers and said, \"This is Rickey calling on behalf of Rickey, and Rickey wants to play baseball\"?\n\nHenderson's grinned and replied, \"False. I like that.\"\n\nWhen Henderson checked into a hotel, was it true that he sometimes checked in under the pseudonym of Richard Pryor? \"Yes,\" he confirmed. \"[Also] James Brown, Luther Vandross.\"\n\nIn the early 1980s, the A's accounting department was freaking out because their books were off by $1 million -- and as the famous story goes, Henderson had taken a $1 million bonus check and framed it without cashing it, and hung it on the wall in his house. Was this accurate? \"That's true,\" Henderson said, laughing.\n\nThere was a story that Henderson fell asleep on an ice pack in the middle of August, got frostbite, and missed three games. \"Yes, that was with Toronto,\" Henderson said. \"I was icing my ankle.\"\n\nHis final days\n\nLast year, in La Russa's last serious conversation with Henderson, the player asked his former manager: \"What record did I obtain that you never thought was possible?\" La Russa replied, \"'3,000 hits.' I didn't think, with all his walks, that he would get to 3,000 hits. You don't want to walk him. But if you throw a strike, he hits it on the barrel for a single, double, triple or home runs.\"\n\nLast year, Cameron and Nevin attended games in those last days of the Oakland Coliseum. When Nevin bumped into him, Henderson greeted him warmly -- \"Hiya, Phil!\" -- and talked about how much he enjoyed getting to know Nevin's son, Tyler, who played 87 games with the A's last season. Henderson, Nevin recalled, \"still looked like he could put a uniform on.\"\n\nLate in the season, Brent Rooker, Oakland's All-Star slugger, approached Henderson in the clubhouse, where he was playing cards, and told him he had heard an interview with a longtime writer who opined about the best player he had ever covered. \"Who was it?\" Henderson asked.\n\n\"It was you,\" Rooker said.\n\nHenderson replied, \"Well, who else would it have been?\" And for Rooker, it was an affirmation that Henderson's swagger, his confidence, was indomitable. \"He carried that same aura about him all the time,\" Rooker recalled, \"and he was a blast to be around.\"\n\nIn early December, longtime Padres hitting coach Merv Rettenmund died, and some of Rettenmund's friends and former players scheduled a gathering in San Diego. The expectation was that Henderson would attend. But just before the event, Henderson spoke to a former teammate and mentioned that he had been fighting a cold and hadn't been feeling well. \"I haven't had a cold in 15 years,\" Henderson said.\n\nSoon thereafter, Henderson was gone.\n\n\"I never saw him have a bad day on a baseball field,\" Cameron said. \"To get a chance to play with someone of that nature.\n\n\"The joy. It was crazy. It was special.\"",

    "summary": "Their son Kevin is one of Stoneman Douglas' best pitchers, sturdily built like his father.\nSports world responds to Parkland The Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, had a profound impact on the sports world.\nAnd the response is that Stoneman Douglas is the only place that can make change happen.\nIt was curriculum night at Stoneman Douglas, sort of an orientation for new students.\nWith Hixon gone, she was spending much of her time as the administrator at Stoneman Douglas' spring games.",
    "publish_date": null,
    "authors": [],
    "raw_text": "It was Valentine's Day, and they all had plans. Mitch Dworet dropped both of his boys off for school in the morning, told them he loved them and said he'd be back to drop off the car later so Nick could drive to swim practice.\n\nHe was always telling them that he loved them. And that he was proud of them. Six years ago, Mitch left a job in corporate America to spend more time with his sons. Mitch and his wife, Annika, could see their time with Nick dwindling. College was coming soon, and he'd just accepted a swimming scholarship at the University of Indianapolis.\n\nNick wrote his goals on a sheet of notebook paper and hung them on a wall next to his bed.\n\nI want to become a Swedish Olympian and go to Tokyo 2020 ...\n\nI will give all I have in my body and my mind to achieve the goal that I have set ...\n\nEven on my hardest days I swear to give it my all, and I will let nothing stand in my way.\n\nHistory of the Holocaust was Nick's last class of the day on Feb. 14. Around 2 o'clock, his teacher, Ivy Schamis, saw a tall, young man standing by her desk in her peripheral vision. It was just one of her students handing her a box of Valentine's Day chocolates.\n\nSchamis is one of those teachers you always say you're going to go back and visit -- 50ish but cool enough to captivate an audience a fraction of her age. She wasn't supposed to be working that day because she was closing on a condo with her husband, Jeff, but then there was a problem with the water pressure, and Schamis decided she'd work. Ultimately, she was glad she went in that day, even after everything that happened. She couldn't imagine her students going through that without her.\n\nThe class in Room 1214 was studying the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and near the end of the period, Schamis asked whether anyone knew who Adi Dassler was.\n\nNick eagerly raised his hand.\n\n\"'I know,'\" Schamis recalled Nick saying. \"'He owns that shoe factory that started Adidas.'\"\n\n\"How did you know that?\" Schamis asked, the question hanging in the air as the first boom of the AR-15-style rifle rocked the first floor. There was little time to react and no place to hide. Stoneman Douglas used to have drills in the event of an active shooter, hoping there would never be an active shooter, and Schamis would always tell people that if it were ever for real, good luck. There were no closets -- just open space.\n\nThey flew to the corners of the room and huddled together. A boy asked her if they were going to die, and Schamis told him no. But when gunman Nikolas Cruz shot out the glass panel of her classroom door, Schamis figured there was a good chance he'd walk in and kill them all.\n\n\"All he had to do was open the door,\" she says. \"I was thinking about what I was going to say to him.\"\n\nShe decided she'd tell him that she loved him. Cruz stuck his gun through the broken window and fired from the hallway. He never came into the classroom.\n\nSchamis lost two students that day: Nick and junior Helena Ramsay. They were 17.\n\nOne inch, one flinch, and everything might have been different. Nick wanted to take a day off of school that week to catch up on his homework, and his dad said that was fine. Nick stayed home on Feb. 13.\n\nHe was not seated in his normal spot on the 14th. He slid his desk over to a different place.\n\nAcross the hall, Nick's little brother, Alex, had an English class in Room 1216. The 15-year-old looked up to his big brother. They'd get ice cream together, and they'd blast music on the way to school.\n\nAlex was in the first classroom hit with gunfire. He was leaning over to write on a piece of paper when the first round went off. A bullet grazed him in the back of the head. A classmate next to him was mortally wounded.\n\nAlex dove into a corner, just in time before the shooter came back and sprayed the classroom with bullets again. Alex later called his parents from the back of an ambulance to tell them he was on his way to the hospital. Although Annika was, in Mitch's words, \"freaking out,\" she felt a slight sense of relief.\n\n\"Somehow,\" she says, \"the mathematical part of you goes, 'OK, there's [about 3,300] kids. What's the odds of two of them [being shot]?'\"\n\nIn the middle of the night, at a Marriott that served as a waiting area for families to hear the worst possible news, the Dworets learned that Nick was dead.\n\nPeople close to Nick say the same thing: He was so happy. He'd gone on his recruiting trip to Indianapolis, and when he got there, with the city covered in snow, the Florida boy lay down and made a snow angel. He knew before he left Indianapolis that he wanted to go there, so he just came out and told Indy coach Jason Hite what he was doing, that he was going to commit. He felt surrounded by equally motivated men. He felt at peace.\n\nHe became friends with fellow recruit Jakob Pettit, a swimmer from Illinois, and Pettit decided to become a Greyhound on that trip, too.\n\n\"I feel like we connected,\" Pettit says. \"It was really hard to realize we'd only known each other for three weeks.\"\n\nNick hadn't always been so focused. As a freshman, he was burned out on swimming, quit the sport for a few months and let his grades slip. But then he joined a new club team, TS Aquatics, and rededicated himself. His GPA rose to 3.1; his swimming reached a different level.\n\nAnnika and Mitch loved being swim parents, loved being part of Nick's journey. There's a swim app that tracks teams and times, and Annika downloaded it to keep up. Then Nick was gone, and the app still alerted her to his teammates' triumphs and failures. She couldn't take it and had to delete the app.\n\nThe school year went on, and the milestones were unbearable. There was senior prom and all the photos on Facebook of smiling teenagers in their formal wear, living the life that Nick wouldn't.\n\nGraduation was on June 3. The Dworets were invited but had no idea whether they could muster the strength to go. Someone suggested that a relative, maybe his brother, could walk on stage and accept Nick's diploma.\n\nBut getting through a day of school was a challenge for Alex. Every classroom he was in, he was always looking for an escape route. He can't stand loud noises but can't take the quiet, either. He sleeps with a nightlight.\n\n\"He never really feels safe anywhere,\" Annika says.\n\nHe occasionally goes into Nick's room to get his brother's clothes, but rarely talks about him.\n\nThe boys always loved to eat -- Nick stashed a collection of Oreos in his closet -- but now even dinner is depressing. The table has just three place settings, and one empty chair. The Dworets recently canceled a meal service they'd used for the first few months after the shooting, but the prospect of grocery shopping seemed daunting: They'd buy half the amount of food without Nick.\n\n\"It's a broken dream,\" Mitch says. \"I don't want to be like a Hallmark card, but that's what it is. This kid was a dream. He was the best of us.\"\n\nIt seems silly now that the biggest thing weighing on Rule's mind the afternoon of Feb. 14 was a basketball game. Stoneman Douglas had a regional quarterfinal date with Cypress Bay the next night, and Rule was in the locker room, getting ready for a 3 o'clock practice.\n\nThe Eagles made a deep run in the playoffs last year, but this postseason didn't look nearly as promising after star player Abbey Hsu tore her ACL on Feb. 7. Realizing that this could be their last practice, Rule wanted to get the team ready for Cypress Bay but also make the workout fun. A dozen things bounced through her mind when the fire alarm went off at 2:22 p.m. She grabbed her walkie-talkie and headed outside, unaware that a gunman, armed with an assault rifle and more than 300 rounds of ammunition, had just opened fire on the first floor of Building 12.\n\nThree-fourths of Rule's family was on campus that afternoon. Over at the baseball field, her husband, Jeff Heinrich, was watering the grass in anticipation of practice. Their son Kevin is one of Stoneman Douglas' best pitchers, sturdily built like his father.\n\nRule was not particularly worried about the safety of her family when a mass of students poured outside. (Her younger son, Colton, is in middle school). It was supposed to be a fire drill. She was surprised to see Kevin just a few feet away. He'd just gone on a bathroom pass and somehow wound up right next to her. \"A miracle,\" she says now.\n\nWhen they first heard pops, they figured it was fireworks. But then a \"code red\" went out on her radio, and the next sounds felt like bullets whizzing over their heads.\n\nThey ran and wound up in the culinary room, with 63 others piled into a space roughly the size of three large closets. Student David Hogg -- who became a national activist after the mass shooting and who was falsely accused by conspiracy theorists of being an actor instead of a student -- was among those sheltered in the room.\n\nHeinrich is a sergeant with the Coral Springs Police Department. Two years ago, he was hailed as a hero for thwarting a potential school shooting in Coral Springs, which is near Parkland. He was wearing shorts and a T-shirt on the afternoon of Feb. 14 because he was off duty. He didn't have his gun. He has beaten himself up over not having his gun.\n\nHeinrich heard people screaming and ran toward the parking lot. He saw a kid with a hole in his right leg. Heinrich helped get 15-year-old Kyle Laman to the baseball clubhouse, grabbed a first-aid kit and stuffed the wound with gauze and bandages. He got a good description of the shooter from Kyle and called it in. A police captain from Coral Springs handed him a gun and a bulletproof vest. He headed toward Building 12.\n\nAt some point, he called his wife.\n\n\"Where's Kevin?\" he asked Rule. She told Heinrich that Kevin was with her, he was safe, and she could feel her husband exhale through the phone.\n\n\"This is the real deal,\" he told her. \"There's an active shooter on campus.\"\n\nSports world responds to Parkland\n\nThe Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, had a profound impact on the sports world. More coverage.\n\nRule never worried about Heinrich. When you're married to a cop, you eventually figure out that your spouse has chosen this life and you can't spend your time worrying. She focused on keeping the kids quiet and calm.\n\nThey huddled close for more than an hour, watching their school implode on a computer screen. Nobody knew how bad it was. Heinrich eventually arranged for them to get a ride, and they got home around 7 that night. Rule had left her purse inside the school, and she had nothing -- no keys, no money, no ID.\n\nBut a neighbor had a key to their house. When Rule knocked on the door, the neighbor was crying. She wrapped Rule and Kevin in a hug.\n\nTheir regional game was postponed a week, but it wasn't enough time. One of Rule's players, Maddy Wilford, had been shot at least three times. Wilford's injuries were so bad that first responders initially thought she was dead.\n\nHow could they possibly set foot in a gym? Everyone was mourning someone. Rule eventually decided that Stoneman Douglas would forfeit its girls' basketball game. She couldn't fathom doing it. She had spent her whole life telling her teams to never quit. In 25 years of coaching, she'd never forfeited anything -- not a scrimmage, not a rec league game.\n\nA week after the shooting, Rule sits in a diner near her house, staring at a plate of eggs and tomatoes. Above the counter, a TV plays nonstop coverage. In her scant amount of free time, she tries to watch and read everything: stories of the dead, stories of when school will start again, even some of the conspiracy stuff.\n\nThroughout the breakfast, the only time she perks up is when she talks about Abbey Hsu. As a junior, the kid could grab the rim. Twenty-five years of coaching, and Hsu's the best she's ever had, and ...\n\nShe is interrupted when a police officer approaches the table. He'd noticed her Stoneman Douglas polo shirt.\n\n\"So,\" he says, \"is that Hogg kid a student, or is he ...\"\n\nRule stops him. \"He was in the closet with me,\" she says. \"He's in my son's math class. Don't listen to that bullshit.\"\n\nThe cop says it still wouldn't surprise him, and the conversation eventually shifts to building border walls and possibly arming teachers. Rule says she isn't a fan of that.\n\n\"Here's the thing that I think is amazing,\" Rule tells him. \"[People say,] 'Why did this happen at Douglas? It's the safest city in all of Florida.' And the response is that Stoneman Douglas is the only place that can make change happen. If Stoneman Douglas can't, nobody can.\"\n\nShe thanks the cop for being a police officer.\n\n\"Thank you for what you do,\" he says. \"You kept your kids safe.\"\n\nThe last night of his life, Chris Hixon was supposed to be home early. It was curriculum night at Stoneman Douglas, sort of an orientation for new students. How long could that possibly take?\n\nA massive line of parents formed in front of him, armed with questions about their kids playing sports, and Hixon wound up staying longer than anyone because he couldn't just leave if people needed him.\n\nHis wife, Debbi, used to get frustrated that he spent so much time at a job that forced him to drive about 45 minutes one way and paid a little more than half of what she made as a magnet program coordinator at South Broward High. Chris was never one to delegate. He wanted to be at every football game and pep rally. When a coach would leave unexpectedly, he'd often take over for a season, without pay.\n\nHe was rarely home in time for dinner and ate most of his meals out of the microwave.\n\nBut late nights, after 10:30, was their time. He and Debbi would crawl into bed, TV on, and talk about their days. \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" would be playing in the background, until Kimmel started criticizing Donald Trump, and Chris would groan and say, \"Why do we have to watch this shit?\" and they'd turn it to \"M*A*S*H\" instead.\n\nThey met at a wedding. She was the maid of honor, and he was a 20-year-old in the Navy who didn't know anybody but the groom. She felt sorry for him, sitting there all alone, and they talked. It was such an easy conversation. They got a six-pack after the reception and drank it on the beach.\n\nHe reminded her of her dad, kind and strong. \"I would've married him the next day,\" she says.\n\nOh, they weren't perfect. You can't be married to someone for almost three decades without occasionally getting annoyed. The Ed Sheeran song \"Shape of You\" brings her to mush now, but it used to be downright grating. Chris would sing it -- badly -- and rub up against her during the part of the song that goes, \"Grab on my waist and put that body on me.\" She didn't think about it, then, that Chris made her feel beautiful.\n\nHe had this shirt that she always hoped would wind up in the trash, the infamous yellow shirt. Every married man has one of these shirts, which is both comfortable and grotesque. They'll have a closet full of clothes but somehow always manage to gravitate back to the shirt, which is often worn with a regrettable pair of cargo shorts.\n\nWhen Chris died, nearly every photo on every TV and in every newspaper featured him in that yellow shirt. Now all she sees is that damn shirt.\n\nWhat he lacked in fashion sense he made up for as a father to Tommy and Corey, who has special needs. On Saturdays, he'd run to Dandee Donuts with Corey, scarfing down the doughnuts on the walk home and always returning with a pistachio muffin for Debbi.\n\nThe families of the 17 who died formed a group that meets at least once a month. It's a diverse collection of Republicans and Democrats who have bonded over shared grief. Although it's comforting to be around a group of people who know exactly what she's going through, sometimes Debbi feels out of place.\n\nThey lost their babies. She lost her husband, her best friend, her confidant.\n\nShe wonders what he'd think about how she's handling things without him. Like the lawn. He took such pride in that lawn. Her mowing skills are choppy, and she still can't figure out how to use half of the lawn equipment.\n\n\"I have a really hard time going to bed,\" she says. \"I think I'm just still waiting to see if maybe he'll come. I have the messages he left on my phone, and he always says 'I love you' before he hangs up.\"\n\nShe listens to them every night before she falls asleep.\n\nA police detective told her that her husband was a hero, that he charged at the gunman and tried to disarm him. (An official narrative from the Broward County Sheriff's Office has yet to be released). Jeff Morford, an assistant principal at Stoneman Douglas who was friends with Chris, has watched surveillance video and will say only this: \"He was the only one who ran into the building to save kids.\"\n\nWhen the Columbine shootings happened in 1999, Chris and Debbi watched in disbelief. They were working together in South Broward then. Their kids were young; the world was becoming more terrifying; and they decided to write out a will.\n\n\"We were really cognizant of the fact that that could be us,\" she says. \"But you don't ever think it's going to be you. Now I'm sitting here like, 'Shit, it's us.' How, all these years later, is this still happening?\"\n\nNow Corey gets scared when his mom goes to work. He worries that she won't come home.\n\nThe girls' basketball banquet was held on a Sunday in April at a strip mall wings joint. Marilyn Rule decorated the back room and kept a nervous eye on the door. It was the first time the whole team had been together since Feb. 14. She'd made the decision to forfeit the last game without a vote, and for more than a month, the players' uniforms still hung in closets. Would anyone show up?\n\nAround 2 o'clock, Maddy Wilford walked in with her brother. Maddy was shot in the chest and abdomen, and her arm was so badly mangled it looked like \"something from a butcher shop,\" said her dad, David.\n\nBut she was out of the hospital in a week and back in school by March. When she got tired at school, Rule let her lie down in her office. She and Jeff helped get Maddy a service dog, a German shepherd-Malinois mix named Annya.\n\n\"I don't know, man,\" David Wilford says. \"It's a miracle. There's no other explanation for it. To get shot through your ribs and your lung and your abdomen and not have your liver and your spleen and your spine ripped out ... . It's like a God-directed miracle.\"\n\nThe afternoon unfolded like most sports banquets, filled with awards and a slideshow of smiling faces playing basketball -- moments that captured the last days they felt like teenagers. When the banquet ended, their goodbyes seemed awkward, kind of like a band that isn't sure whether it's breaking up.\n\nRule was too tired to overanalyze anything. With Hixon gone, she was spending much of her time as the administrator at Stoneman Douglas' spring games. Her days started at 7 a.m. and didn't end until around 9:30 p.m.\n\nIn May, open-gym sessions began for the girls' basketball team. The sessions were voluntary, but Rule was disappointed in the number of no-shows. One of her young up-and-comers had Scott Beigel as a teacher. She told Rule that every time she went to the class, it made her feel sad and that she just couldn't get herself back into the gym.\n\nRule asked the girl what Coach Beigel would think if he knew she was missing workouts because she was still mourning him.\n\n\"I'm just trying to get her to turn the page,\" Rule says, \"and stop reliving it. ... We need her out there.\"\n\nHer husband, the cop, and her son, the baseball pitcher, seemed fine. But deep down, Rule wasn't. One weekend, she went to a counseling session and just lost it, bawling uncontrollably. It shocked her that she had all that inside of her but didn't have time to let it out.\n\nStoneman Douglas' seniors had their last day of school in late May. Rule's two seniors never stopped by to say goodbye, and it upset her. She wondered whether her decision to forfeit fractured the relationships she valued. But maybe it wasn't about her at all.\n\nLuke Hoyer's fluorescent green journal sat mostly empty for months, which shouldn't have been much of a surprise. The class was full of freshmen with the same sort of inhibitions as 15-year-old Luke.\n\nBut as the school year began to wind down, the words slowly came. The pages started filling up.\n\nLuke was a surprise baby. He came five years after his brother, Jake, and about eight years after Abby. Gena Hoyer was two months along before she suspected she might be pregnant, and when the store-bought test revealed she was, her husband, Tom, thought she was joking.\n\nBut Luke was such an easy baby, so easy to please. \"Gosh, Tom, what would we do without him?\" Gena used to ask her husband, never imagining that someday they'd have to answer that question.\n\nWith Jake in college at UCF and Abby living in Denver, Gena and Luke were together a lot. People called him a mama's boy, and that was just fine with Luke. He liked being the only kid in the house. He barely winced at the nickname his mom gave him -- Lukey Bear -- even when the women in her book club called him that.\n\nGena has been told that Luke was probably the first person shot that day. The first official account of what happened in Building 12 was released in late April in the form of a graphic animated video. It was presented by a state commission investigating what went wrong that day, and it covers the nearly 7 minutes that Cruz was in the building. The people are represented by dots. Students are green dots. Staff members are blue. The shooter appears as a black dot with a line through it to represent his assault rifle. When a person is shot and injured, the dot turns yellow. When he or she dies, the dot becomes purple.\n\nIt's almost surreal, watching their son's life boil down to a dot. The video shows his dot turning yellow in the hallway, and eventually the ominous black dot returns, making him purple.\n\n\"I remember when the detective came,\" Gena says. \"I said, 'I have one question for you. You've seen [the shooter]. You've talked to him. Is he remorseful?' He said, 'No.'\"\n\nOne of the hardest things for Gena to do is look at Luke's handwriting. His books and pens and paper are in a backpack with a tag that says \"Evidence\" on it.\n\nGena once made him watch a YouTube video of a Navy SEAL admiral giving a commencement speech about the importance of making your bed, but she is glad he didn't do it on his last day. It lets her go in his bedroom without disrupting anything and dream of Luke.\n\n\"I go up there and sit sometimes,\" Gena says. \"No, I go up there all the time.\n\n\"It's comforting.\"\n\nAlthough their house is in a gated community near a golf course, Luke was a minimalist. Tom and Gena wanted to buy him a laptop for Christmas. All he asked for was the necklace with a cross on it. Gena now wears the cross every day.\n\nLuke used to talk to his personal trainer, Chris Kerr, about God and girls and just about everything he couldn't say to his parents.\n\nKerr gave him three pointers for dealing with girls: Be respectful; be nice to her friends; and make sure you smell good. Around that time, Tom Hoyer noticed that his son was showering more. He figured it was for a girl.\n\nIt wasn't until after Luke's funeral, when his friends gathered at the Hoyer house, that Gena and Tom realized how much their son had been starting to open up.\n\n\"He was like my brother,\" childhood friend Vinny Caronna says. \"I could talk to him about anything.\"\n\nOn Mother's Day, Jack O'Keeffe, one of Luke's close friends, brought Gena flowers. Jack is the one who persuaded Luke to play football. Gena, a Southerner who grew up in SEC country, couldn't wait to see her boy play. Now she hopes to someday watch Jack.\n\nTheir house is quiet now, except for the sounds of their two dogs rustling about. Gena watches episodes of \"Friends\" over and over on her iPad. She doesn't watch the news. She doesn't want to hear about Cruz, who faces 17 counts of first-degree murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.\n\nShe's going to therapy with Tom, and she says it's helpful, but some weeks are harder than others. The first week of June was one of them. Maybe it was because school had just gotten out. Gena and Tom decided to drive to Hollywood, Florida, to see Debbi Hixon, who still hadn't figured out how to use the weed wacker or the edger.\n\nTom gave her some pointers, then the women went inside to talk while he did most of the yardwork. They talked about Luke and Chris and all the things they were both feeling. The Hoyers went home, and by Monday, Gena was feeling a little better.\n\nThey didn't know each other before Feb. 14. Now, they need each other.\n\nAfter a lot of agonizing, the Dworets decided they would go to graduation. One of Nick's childhood friends, Alexandra Greenwald, would walk to the stage and get his diploma. Alexandra and Nick had been friends since kindergarten. They had class together earlier in the day on Feb. 14, and when they parted ways, he said, \"See you tomorrow.\"\n\nAlexandra is going to the University of Iowa in the fall on a gymnastics scholarship.\n\nGraduation was held at the BB&T Center, home of the Florida Panthers, and the Dworets were given a suite to sit in during the ceremony. The seniors who lost their lives would have their names announced first, which was good because Mitch couldn't wait to get out of there.\n\nNick's name was called, and Mitch could envision his blond-haired, All-American son beaming, taking his first steps toward the future. A woman arrived in the suite a few minutes later with Nick's diploma. Mitch couldn't lift his arms to take it.\n\n\"I just looked at her with a blank stare,\" he says. \"I couldn't take it. I was dead inside. It was torture. It was lovely that she brought it to us and wanted to hand it to me. I just couldn't. I couldn't look at it until I got home a little later in the night. I don't know, man. It's hard.\"\n\nMitch will not get to see Nick swim in college or in the Olympics. But Ryan Lochte met the family this spring and said he wanted to dedicate his run to the 2020 Olympics to Nick. The six-time gold medalist is swimming for Nick. If Lochte makes it to Tokyo, Mitch says, they will be there, cheering him on. They'll cross it off Nick's list.",

    "raw_text": "We're just past the halfway point of the Premier League season, and shocks and surprises continue to reverberate across the competition. Wasn't this supposed to be a transitional year for Liverpool under new boss Arne Slot? Yet they are in first place, six points clear of Arsenal with a game in hand, and look like champions elect.\n\nWho would have believed last season's strugglers Nottingham Forest would be in the top three? Or that champions Manchester City would implode? Or that Manchester United would languish in 13th while AFC Bournemouth and Fulham challenged for the qualifying places for Europe.\n\nLikewise, some surprising players have emerged as the stars of the season after 20 games. With that in mind, here is my half-term team of the campaign.\n\nGoalkeeper: Jordan Pickford, Everton\n\nWhere would the Toffees be without the heroics of their long-serving keeper? Probably in the bottom three. His remarkable defiance earned an unlikely point at Arsenal. And he saved penalties from Anthony Gordon and Erling Haaland to ensure his team managed draws against Newcastle United and Manchester City respectively.\n\nFor a team that has failed to score in eight of their past 10 matches, Everton are lucky the England No. 1 has been as good as he has.\n\nRight-back: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool\n\nDespite his off day against Manchester United, he remains a unique talent -- a right-back who is among Europe's elite as a creator and striker of wonderful passes. He makes my midseason starting XI because I'm focusing on what he can do and not on some of his deficiencies. Real Madrid's overtures to sign him in the summer transfer window are understandable, and they are a hard club to turn down.\n\nWhether Alexander-Arnold sticks or twists, we'll know soon enough.\n\nCentre-back: Murillo, Nottingham Forest\n\nHis central defensive partnership with Nikola Milenkovi\u0107 is a big reason Forest are surprisingly (and, to most, inconceivably) third in the table, behind only Liverpool and Arsenal. They have kept a league-high nine clean sheets while racking up 12 wins in their first 20 games.\n\nAthletic and aggressive, Murillo also tops the Premier League charts for clearances (117). It's only a matter of time before he signs for a bigger club.\n\nCentre-back: Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, Arsenal\n\nHe's rock solid in the league's best defense (18 goals conceded) and a key player in the Gunners' set-piece successes. His three league goals include a winner against arch-rivals Spurs, and another in a 2-2 draw against Man City.\n\nLeft-back: Antonee Robinson, Fulham\n\nAt left-back, the pacy and dangerous United States international has more assists (13) than any other defender over the past two campaigns and seven this season alone. He also tops the stats for interceptions (37). Fulham will do well to hold on to him, as he looks a perfect fit for any big club wanting a left-back or wing-back who can operate high up the pitch.\n\nCentral midfield: Mois\u00e9s Caicedo, Chelsea\n\nPerhaps overburdened by the \u00a3115 million transfer fee when he first moved from Brighton & Hove Albion to Chelsea, he has settled to become the midfield strong man he looked on the south coast. Only Crystal Palace's Daniel Mu\u00f1oz (71) has made more tackles than Caicedo (62), who will be vital to Chelsea's chances of finishing in the top four and qualifying for next season's UEFA Champions League.\n\nCentral midfield: Ryan Gravenberch, Liverpool\n\nAfter being a bit-part player for former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, the Dutchman has made the problem defensive midfield position his own under Arne Slot. Gravenberch mixes steel and silk, providing an ideal foil for Alexis Mac Allister.\n\nRight-wing: Mohamed Salah, Liverpool\n\nAlmost beyond dispute, Salah has been the player of the season so far with 31 goal involvements, scoring 18 times in 19 games, with another 13 assists. He's always likely to produce a match-changing moment and, at 32, still in terrific condition. Surely, Liverpool will find a deal to keep him at Anfield beyond this summer when his contract expires.\n\nAttacking midfield: Cole Palmer, Chelsea\n\nIce cold, but red hot! With 13 goals and six assists, Palmer is demonstrating that his 2023-24 breakthrough season was no flash in the pan. Languid and deceptive, his vision and eye for goal lend him a touch of genius. He carries his extraordinary talent -- not to mention his team -- with a what's-all-the-fuss demeanor.\n\nLeft-wing: Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford\n\nMatching Palmer with 13 Premier League goals, Mbeumo and his teammate Yoane Wissa (10 goals) are making sure the Bees do not miss former poster boy Ivan Toney, who left for Al Ahli this season.\n\nBrentford will continue to punch well above their weight if they keep Mbeumo happy and manager Thomas Frank in charge.\n\nStriker: Alexander Isak, Newcastle United\n\nThe Sweden international has scored in each of the last seven games to lead a Newcastle revival. Quick and almost balletic in his movements, Isak's all-round contributions to Eddie Howe's team makes him the best No. 9 in the game right now. He scores all types of goals -- 13 in the league -- and, with the club valuing his transfer fee at \u00a3150m, most clubs won't be able to afford signing him. It's Newcastle's way of saying \"hands off!\"\n\nSubstitutes",

    "raw_text": "India at the Olympics has quite the history, with medals dating back to pre-Independence in 1900. India has won a total of 40 medals from 26 modern Games.\n\nWhile this isn't the most impressive of hauls, ranking India as 57th in the all-time table, it makes every medal precious to a nation of over 1.5 billion.\n\nNote: India has never won a Winter Olympics medal - all 38 have come at the Summer Olympics. India also did not participate in the 1896, 1904, 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics.\n\nHere is every medal won by India at the Olympics.\n\n1900 Paris Olympics\n\nIndia made their debut at the 1900 Paris Olympics, despite being under British rule. Norman Pritchard, born in Calcutta, was the lone athlete representing India - according to the International Olympic Council, although this is disputed in other historical records. Pritchard won two silver medals to kick off India's medal tally.\n\nNorman Pritchard - SILVER - Men's 200m hurdles\n\nNorman Pritchard - SILVER - Men's 200m sprint\n\n1928 Amsterdam Olympics\n\nIndia won their first-ever gold medal at the Olympics in men's hockey. Dhyan Chand led a dominant team to gold, kicking off a streak of six consecutive gold medals.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey\n\n1932 Los Angeles Olympics\n\nIndia secured their biggest ever win (24-1 vs USA) en route to their second consecutive gold in men's hockey.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey\n\n1936 Berlin Olympics\n\nDhyan Chand made it a hat-trick of gold medals for India, defeating Germany in the men's hockey final.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey\n\n1948 London Olympics\n\nIndia won their first-ever Olympic medal as an independent nation, with no surprise as to its origin. A new generation of hockey players lead by Balbir Singh Sr. continued India's dominance.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey\n\n1952 Helsinki Olympics\n\nThe Indian men's hockey team made it five in a row, with Balbir Singh Sr. increasing his legend with a superb performance in the final. India also won their first-ever medal in wrestling, with KD Jadhav earning independent India's first-ever individual medal.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey\n\nKD Jadhav - BRONZE - Men's wrestling (bantamweight)\n\n1956 Melbourne Olympics\n\nBalbir Singh Sr. and his band of merry men made it six gold medals in a row for the Indian men's hockey team - an Olympic feat not bettered in a team event apart from USA's basketball teams.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey\n\n1960 Rome Olympics\n\nIndia reached double digits in their Olympic medal tally but it wasn't a gold in men's hockey as expected, with a Balbir Singh Sr. - less India losing to Pakistan in the final.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - SILVER - Field hockey\n\n1964 Tokyo Olympics\n\nThe Indian men's hockey team faced Pakistan in the final for a third consecutive time but won gold this time.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey\n\n1968 Mexico City Olympics\n\nThe Indian men's hockey team failed to reach the final for the first time in the last eight Olympics, losing in the semifinal to Australia and then beating West Germany to win bronze.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - BRONZE - Field hockey\n\n1972 Munich Olympics\n\nIndia made it 10 consecutive medals for the men's hockey team, as well as the nation, which went medal-less in 1976. A loss to Pakistan in the semifinal was followed by a win over Netherlands to win bronze.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - BRONZE - Field hockey\n\n1980 Moscow Olympics\n\nThe Indian men's hockey team returned to the summit, after a catastrophic 1976 Olympics and won gold. It would be Indian hockey's last medal until the bronze in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nIndia men's hockey team - GOLD - Field hockey\n\n1996 Atlanta Olympics\n\nAfter 14 medals in the previous 15 Olympics, India's run came to a hard stop in the next three, going medal-less in 1984, 1988 and 1992. Leander Paes ended the 16-year drought with a shock bronze in tennis, losing to Andre Agassi in the semifinal before beating Fernando Meligani to earn India's 15th Olympic medal and only the third individual medal.\n\nLeander Paes - Bronze - Men's singles, Tennis\n\n2000 Sydney Olympics\n\nWeightlifter Karnam Malleswari became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal, and only the fourth individual medal in the nation's history.\n\nKarnam Malleswari - BRONZE - Women's weightlifting (54kg)\n\n2004 Athens Olympics\n\nRajyavardhan Singh Rathore won India's sole medal at the Athens Olympics and became the first Indian shooter to win an Olympic medal.\n\nRajyavardhan Singh Rathore - SILVER - Men's double trap shooting\n\n2008 Beijing Olympics\n\nIndia won three medals at an Olympics for the first-time ever, with Abhinav Bindra, Vijender Singh and Sushil Kumar making it India's then most successful Olympics and taking the nation's tally to 20. Bindra's gold was India's first-ever individual gold medal, while Vijender Singh won India's first boxing medal at the Olympics.\n\nAbhinav Bindra - GOLD - Men's 10m air rifle shooting\n\nVijender Singh - BRONZE - Men's middleweight boxing\n\nSushil Kumar - BRONZE - Men's wrestling (freestyle 66kg)\n\n2012 London Olympics\n\nIndia doubled their best-ever tally at the Olympics, with six medals taking their overall tally to 26. Saina Nehwal won India's first-ever badminton medal, with five-time world champion Mary Kom becoming the first Indian woman to win a boxing medal (only because this was the first edition of women's boxing at the Olympics).

    "raw_text": "Editor's note: This story originally was published Aug. 27, 2018. At the time, Marc Gasol was a member of the Memphis Grizzlies. In February 2019, he was traded to the Toronto Raptors. This story has been updated.\n\nMonday, July 16, 10:35 p.m.\n\nSOMEWHERE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA -- Where are they?\n\nAs dusk turns to dark and the stars begin to show and a bad moon rises in the mid-July sky, where are the immigrants sighted earlier in the day in a rubber raft puttering due north?\n\nThis is the question Marc Gasol asks as he stares at a sea more than 3.5 times the size of Texas. He has come to these waters and to this search-and-rescue ship in the middle of the Mediterranean to see for himself, to help if he can, to understand. He's thinking about the people on that raft, thinking how terrified they must be, how hungry and thirsty they are, how utterly desperate they must be.\n\nTheir last known position was about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. These days, that is a very bad place to be -- hundreds of miles of open sea before them, the Libyan Coast Guard behind. Already this year, according to the United Nations Migration Agency, more than 1,500 immigrants -- and 600 in June alone -- have died or gone missing while trying to cross these achingly beautiful blue waters to the shores of Europe.\n\nAs the skies darken, the blue is replaced by black, the water temperature drops, and a rubber raft bobs somewhere in the sea. Nobody knows how many immigrants are on the raft or whether they're alive or if the Libyans already have found them. All anyone knows for sure is that they have a 1-in-31 chance of survival, according to the UN June/July figures.\n\nAbout 115 miles away is a converted tugboat named Open Arms, and not far behind it is the slower, 48-year-old retrofitted yacht named the Astral. They are humanitarian rescue ships, sanctioned by no government, unwelcome in a growing number of European countries and ports, operated by a mixture of volunteers and search-and-rescue lifers. They are making their way south, guided by their radar, GPS and the radio chatter from ships aware of the raft sighting.\n\nAt the wheel of the Astral is captain Riccardo Gatti. The only other person on the bridge is Gasol, at the time a Memphis Grizzlies center whose $24.1 million NBA salary makes him the wealthiest -- and tallest -- volunteer deckhand in the history of the immigrant rescue boat. \"I'm going to try to lay down,'' he says, \"but I don't think sleeping tonight is a real option.\"\n\nA day earlier, Sunday, July 15, 9:31 p.m.\n\nBARCELONA -- One by one, they approach him for a quick photo: There's a family of four and two girlfriends on holiday and airline gate attendants. Gasol, who was born in this Spanish seaside city and lives here during the NBA offseason, is waiting to board a flight to Malta, a speck of an island in the Mediterranean.\n\nHe is almost completely surrounded by 10 women who have emerged from the nearby jet bridge of an arriving flight. This three-time NBA All-Star, former NBA Defensive Player of the Year, two-time Olympian, FIBA World Cup champion, husband, father of two young children and global philanthropist smiles like someone who has been stopped many times at many airports for a photo op.\n\nHe has invited us -- former University of Arizona quarterback-turned-producer Jason Johnson and me -- to chronicle Mission No. 47 of Proactiva Open Arms, the NGO (nongovernmental organization) that conducts monthly search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea. Also on the flight is Proactiva Open Arms founder and president Oscar Camps, who approved the invitation.\n\n\"I am the bait -- the hook,'' Gasol says of his role in the story.\n\nGasol has followed the work of Proactiva Open Arms \"from a distance'' for a little more than a year. He was moved by the desperation of the immigrants and by the efforts of NGOs such as the nonprofit Proactiva to rescue them. When Camps asked him to join a mission, he didn't hesitate.\n\n\"It's something that I truly believe in and something that I really feel,'' says Gasol, who didn't ask the Grizzlies for their blessing to take the trip, nor did he provide the team details of what it entailed. \"Probably won't be the same guy after the mission. And I'm aware of that, and I'm OK with that.''\n\nThere are those close to Gasol who asked if this trip was really a good idea. Even his wife, Cristina, had her concerns before offering full support. But to Gasol, there were no second thoughts.\n\n\"If you want to be able to tell a story to other people and to bring more awareness to the issue, you have to go through it,'' he says. \"I am nervous. ... I'm anxious because the not knowing.''\n\n\"The worst being?'' I ask.\n\n\"Death,'' Gasol says. \"The worst being little children floating in the water.''\n\nMonday, July 16, 12:30 a.m.\n\nVALLETTA, Malta -- Our flight lands in the smallest capital city in the European Union. We gather our bags, and 45 minutes later, the five of us -- Camps, Gasol, Proactiva coordinator Marta Sarralde, Johnson and I -- are sitting at a sidewalk pizza caf\u00e9 near the city center.\n\nCamps, 63, pulls out his cell phone, pokes a finger at his photos icon and scrolls to pictures of a recent audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican. During a July 6 \"Holy Mass for the Migrants'' at Saint Peter's Basilica, the Pope closed his homily by switching to Spanish and speaking directly to the assembled rescuers, including Camps and his Proactiva crew members, as well as immigrants who had been rescued from the Mediterranean. He compared the rescuers to the Good Samaritan, who saved the life of a stranger.\n\nGasol looks hard at the photos and at that life vest. He has a 4-year-old daughter and a 16-month-old son, and he's trying to comprehend a scenario that would cause a parent to put a child in a raft, in harm's way.\n\n\"I would have to be really, really desperate,'' he says. \"If [there's] no other way ... you'd probably go through the same thought process as these [parents].''\n\nMonday, July 16, 12:20 p.m.\n\n\"Basically, they hate us,'' Sarralde says. \"They call us smugglers.''\n\n\"They'' are those in Malta and Italy, as well other EU nations, who partly blame NGOs such as Proactiva for the influx of immigrants. According to the UN Migration Agency, there have been 77,483 immigrant arrivals (63,142 by sea, 14,341 by land) in 2018 via the dozens of known transit routes from Africa, Asia or the Middle East. Italy, Greece and Spain are the most frequent landing spots.\n\nIn the past, the Proactiva ships were allowed to dock in the harbor of Valletta. But no longer. Malta, with rare exception, has shut its borders to immigrants and its docks to the NGO ships that rescue them. It has followed the lead of Italy and the hardline anti-immigration stance of Matteo Salvini, the country's deputy prime minister and interior minister.\n\n\"... Extremely contentious at all different levels,'' says Susan Fratzke, a policy analyst at the Washington D.C.-based Migration Policy Institute. \"When you look at the political space, it's become a huge point of conflict in a number of different governments at the national level.''\n\nThe hardliners accuse the nine NGOs that have a history of operating in the Mediterranean of being nothing more than \"taxis'' for immigrants. Those critics have, at times, accused the NGOs of colluding and profiting from alleged relationships with human traffickers. Camps says the accusations are false.\n\nAs another way to reduce the flow of immigrants into its country, Italy has provided ships, equipment and financial support to the Libyan Coast Guard to act as a first line of border defense. According to the UN Migration Agency, more than 10,000 immigrants have been returned to Libya by the coast guard this year. Thousands of the migrants are placed in overcrowded detention centers.\n\n\"The detention camps are horrific,\" says Matthew Reynolds, a regional representative of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. \"They are almost concentration camps, in some cases.''\n\nThese tactics and border closings have contributed to a dramatic decrease in the number of immigrants reaching Europe in recent years. There were 390,432 immigrant arrivals to Europe in 2016 and less than half that many (186,768) in 2017, according to UN Migration Agency figures. The latest immigrant arrival numbers suggest another decrease in 2018.\n\n\"There are fewer people crossing than in the past, but it has become much more dangerous,'' Reynolds said. \"As people have become more desperate, and coast guards and so on have clamped down more, people are taking more desperate routes. ... There is the danger of the high seas, of getting on a very rickety, rickety boat -- I'm not sure even some of them would be considered boats.''\n\nAdds Fratzke: \"They're aware of the fact that ... they might die trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea, but they don't think it could possibly be any worse than what they're leaving behind.''\n\nEurope remains divided on how best to deal with the 1.8 million immigrants who have arrived by sea since 2014. There is no consensus within the European Union relative to immigration policy, and according to the New York Times, EU polling indicates that immigration remains a hot-button issue.\n\nShortly after noon, our party is taken to the 65-foot charter boat, where we wait as Camps negotiates fuel costs with the owner over the phone. Camps and Sarralde have told the owner that the day cruise will take us 40 miles out to sea, into international waters. This part is true. What we don't find out until later is that Camps has told the owner that he and Gasol are there to assist an American television reporter and producer in the \"research and observation of Mediterranean marine life.''\n\nWithout the cover story, Camps explains later, the boat owner was unlikely to approve the charter for those affiliated with an NGO. This is the level of divide between the pro- and anti-immigrant factions.\n\nWe finally make our way out of the harbor, then north, then west past the archipelago of Gozo. Camps nods toward Malta as it slips below the horizon and out of sight. \"The rock in the sea,'' he says. It will be the last land we see for five days.\n\nCamps gives us a shorthand version of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: owner of a handful of businesses in Spain, he started Proactiva with about $170,000 of his own money in late 2015. His two rescue ships were donated or loaned for use, and a global fundraising campaign has helped finance the operating costs of missions, which cost about $8,000 per day, Camps says.\n\nAt 3:10 p.m., the charter boat comes to a stop. We have reached the 40-mile marker and the limit of the gas purchase. Camps pulls out a pair of binoculars and scans the water. Gasol sits near the stern and does the same.\n\nAs we bob in the water, I go talk to the captain, who is conflicted.\n\n\"If in Malta or Italy you say you want to help NGO, they throw rocks at you,'' he says.\n\nThe captain, who is Italian, is sympathetic to the NGO cause. He says he understands the backlash against the arrival of so many immigrants. He acknowledges the argument that such immigration should be \"proportional'' to the size of the admitting country.\n\n\"But Italy is a country of 60 million,'' he says. \"Are 600,000 [immigrants] so much?''\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, there is a radio burst. Someone announces that they are on the way.\n\nWe are told to gather our things. This, says Camps, is a rendezvous point. The Astral is 5 miles away, and a rubber speedboat has been dispatched to take us to the yacht.\n\nGasol grabs his bag and waits near the stern as the speedboat comes into view. His face is serious.\n\n\"So now we begin,'' he says.\n\nMonday, July 16, 5:11 p.m.\n\nABOARD THE ASTRAL -- The 98-foot yacht is German-built and was christened in 1970. It was rebuilt in 1990 in Fort Lauderdale and again in 2009 in Barcelona.\n\nThe crew is multinational: Captain Gatti is a two-year veteran of Proactiva sea-and-rescue missions. The chief engineer, Savvas Kouperinis, is Greek and a former member of that country's Special Forces. The first mate, Juan Rodriguez de la Fuente, is Spanish and has been on multiple Proactiva missions. The cook, Lorenzo Leonetti, is Italian, and he has a large spoon tattoo on his right arm and a large fork tattoo on his left arm. This is his second mission.\n\nThe Astral has been retrofitted for rescue work but not for a 7-foot-1 NBA center. As he is led below deck, Gasol has to bend his head and neck sideways to keep from hitting the ceiling. His cabin is located down another small flight of steps, past a small dining table, the claustrophobic-sized galley and a large garbage can.\n\nGasol shoehorns himself into the room and unpacks his small, white duffel bag without complaint. On the road in the NBA, he stays at five-star hotels. But here at sea, he stays in a room the size of a kitchen pantry.\n\n\"How is it?'' I say, staring at his tiny bunk, wondering how far his size 17s will stretch over the end of the bed.\n\n\"Good,'' he says. \"This will be fine.''\n\nWe are headed south on a course that will take us toward the Libyan coast, a little east of Tripoli but well outside the country's territorial waters. At about 10 knots per hour, the two 290-horsepower diesel engines hardly break a sweat in the relatively calm seas.\n\nThe crews of both the Astral and Open Arms have been monitoring radio chatter since late afternoon, and it indicates that a merchant ship has sighted an immigrant raft making its way north from Libya.\n\nGasol has taken a seat on a padded bench that curves around part of the steering area. It is 6:40 p.m. Dolphins swim alongside the Astral.\n\n\"Right now, I'd be giving the kids a bath, getting ready for dinner,'' he says. \"That's how Monday nights go at the Gasol house.''\n\nEleven minutes later, the radio delivers unwanted news: The Libyan Coast Guard apparently has told the merchant ship that it will handle the search and rescue of the immigrant raft by itself. According to Camps, the coast guard will almost certainly return the immigrants to Libya.\n\nThe raft is approximately 80 miles from the shore, meaning the immigrants have spent nearly two days at sea. In most cases, Proactiva rescuers say, the chances of survival drop to nearly zero after one day in the water. By that point, the immigrants are usually out of food and fresh water. A working compass is all they have left.\n\n\"This is the sea,'' Camps says. \"These boats are rubber, or worse, and they disappear into the shadows.''\n\nOpen Arms, which is several hours ahead of the Astral, will reach the last known raft coordinates by 3:30 a.m. Tuesday. Even then, Gatti says, \"it will not be very easy to find them.''\n\nAcross from the steering column is an area for maps, binoculars, an ashtray, life vests and helmets. Under a protective plastic cover is a sheet of notebook paper filled with handwritten sayings: \"The future belongs to the risk-takers, not the comfort seekers.'' \"Let not what you cannot do tear you from what you can do.''\n\nThere is a lone baby shoe hanging from a pole leading down to the common area.\n\n\"Your kid?'' I ask Gatti.\n\nNo, he says. It came from a child, no older than 1 year old, who was pulled from the sea naked during a rescue. Rodriguez de la Fuente revived the child, who had quit breathing. The shoe, Gatti says, is a happy memento.\n\nTuesday, July 17, 5:59 a.m.\n\nGatti stares at the radar screen. An icon marks Open Arms' position off the port side but nothing else.\n\n\"No boat,'' he says of the search for the immigrants' raft. \"Difficult.''\n\nBefore sunrise, Open Arms began a zig-zag course in search of the raft. The Astral, with its rubber speedboat tied loosely to the bow, splits the middle of the 8-mile-wide search pattern.\n\nGasol, who spent almost the entire night on the bridge, returns with a cup of coffee in his hand. He offers a quick \"good morning,'' then turns his attention to the radar screen and the radio chatter. Several of the crew members are scouring the waters with their binoculars. According to the radar, we have just passed the last known raft coordinates from a day earlier. The crew fears the worst.\n\nThen at 7:11, a radio dispatch in Spanish comes from Open Arms, which is now about 5 miles ahead. Gatti translates for us: Their crew has seen something.\n\nAt 7:21, another radio burst: Open Arms has spotted what's left of the raft. There appear to be two or three bodies in the water, but nothing else. Kouperinis' face contorts in anguish at the news. Gasol drops his head.\n\n\"It looks like the Libyans took the migrants and left the two bodies,'' Gatti says, as he returns the radio microphone to its hook.\n\nAnother radio dispatch, again in Spanish: \"One alive!''\n\nThere is no need for translation. Kouperinis quickly puts on a helmet and life vest and makes his way toward the stern of the Astral, where the speedboat is tied by rope. By 7:50, he has pulled the rubber craft alongside the yacht. Gasol and a small rescue party, also in red helmets and life vests, jump into the boat. Open Arms has lowered its own speedboat into the water. Speedboats are used because the wake of either ship would destroy whatever is left of the wreckage.\n\nIt takes less than seven minutes to reach what's left of the raft. Floating face-down and lifeless on a small plank of wood is a woman whose skin has begun to peel from her arms. Next to her is the body of a young boy. His clothes are gone.\n\nA few feet away is another woman, her arm draped over the corner of a small plank of wood. Her eyes are closed, but they slowly open as several rescue swimmers jump into the gasoline-coated waters and move toward her.\n\nOne of the swimmers takes the boy and rushes him to the Open Arms speedboat. But as soon as they lift the boy from the water, his legs and arms as limp as the branches of a willow tree, they know he is gone. The worker lays him gently on the floor of the rubber craft, soon to be joined by the body of the other woman. The crew will keep the bodies secure and protected from the elements until they reach port.\n\nMeanwhile, the surviving woman is moved toward Gasol's boat. A life belt is positioned under her arms, and she is slowly pulled from the water and settles almost at Gasol's feet. Kouperinis cradles her in his arms. She reeks of gasoline.\n\nThe woman's eyes are open but vacant. Kouperinis tells her to focus on his finger, which he waves in front of her face. He has seen other immigrants pulled from the chilled waters, only to die in his arms as their bodies are overcome by the shock and the cumulative effect of their ordeal. His goal is to keep them awake and aware, which is why he gently taps her face and waves that finger.\n\n\"Welcome to Europe,'' Kouperinis tells her. He says she is not going back to Libya. Instead, they are headed to Italy. The woman slowly raises her finger to mimic his. Gasol stands directly next to them, his face a mixture of awe and disbelief.\n\nGasol says nothing but pats Kouperinis, his newest teammate, on the back. As the rubber boats head toward Open Arms, Gasol looks back at the planks of wood, the tattered, mangled rubber shell of the raft, the empty water bottles, the near-empty blue barrel of petrol, the lone plastic sandal and the compass encased in a piece of light-colored wood bobbing on the surface.\n\nThe medical crew is waiting on Open Arms. The woman is wrapped in a gold foil blanket and then in a blue blanket. A stack of orange life vests becomes her makeshift bed on the main deck. She is given a small bottle of fluids to drink through a straw.\n\nA crew member asks for volunteers to help move the two remaining bodies upstairs to another deck so a doctor can try to determine time of death. Gasol, his right hand bloody at the knuckles, helps lift the stretcher carrying the corpse of the other woman.\n\nBy 11:48 a.m., the woman has whispered her name to the medical crew: Josepha. She is from Cameroon, she says in French.\n\nA decision is made to head north toward the Italian island of Lampedusa, where Camps hopes they can safely offload Josepha, as well as the two non-survivors.\n\nEventually, Gasol and Camps make their way back to the Astral. Once there, it becomes obvious that the rescue has mushroomed into an international incident, with Camps claiming that the three people from the raft were left to perish by the Libyan Coast Guard after they refused to board its boats. Italy's Salvini declares the claim \"lies and insults.'' The story is picked up by newspapers, TV stations and internet sites around the world.\n\n\"If [Proactiva] wasn't here to witness what happened and actually rescue a woman, nobody would have saw, would have heard even about this,'' Gasol says. \"Sometimes you feel rage, anger because you see it so close. ...''\n\nGatti has warned that the increasing winds will make the seas rough. By nightfall, the waves are nearing 7 feet, and at least one member of the volunteer crew has lost his dinner over the side. Gasol arrives on the captain's deck looking a little queasy. He has been driven from his cabin by the bobbing of the ship and the stench that arrives when the toilets bubble up from the motion.\n\nMeanwhile, Camps tells us that Lampedusa is no longer an option. Instead, we will sail to a Spanish-controlled harbor, either Palma on the island of Mallorca or perhaps farther north to Barcelona, where Open Arms and the Astral left the previous week. At our present speed, we will reach Palma, where Gatti happens to live, by Saturday morning.\n\nWednesday, July 18, 2:30 p.m.\n\nGasol visits Open Arms again. He speaks with one of the rescue swimmers, Javier Filgueira, who, like Gasol, is on his first mission. Filgueira helped get Josepha from the wood plank to the speedboat. Asked what he remembers most from those moments, he says, \"her eyes.''\n\nFilgueira has a favor to ask: Will Gasol pose with him for a photo? Gasol happily agrees. He smiles a different smile than the one four days earlier at the Barcelona airport.\n\n\"Obviously, these guys are heroes to me,'' says Gasol, who returns to the Astral later in the day. \"They see somebody in risk, and they don't think twice about jumping in the water.''\n\nAccording to Camps, Josepha has been sleeping soundly, an encouraging sign. Camps says she will need more medical care, including psychological help. The reality of the situation has hit her. Camps says Josepha asked, \"Where are all the others?''\n\nThursday, July 19, 12:30 p.m.\n\nDr. Giovanna Scaccabarozzi has been treating Josepha since her Tuesday morning arrival on Open Arms. Scaccabarozzi can only guess how long Josepha was in the water, but he says the woman was experiencing \"critical'' hypothermia.\n\n\"The condition we found her was really at the edge, between life and death,'' Scaccabarozzi says.\n\nToday we see Josepha out on the main deck again, with the medical crew gently rubbing lotion on her tender legs, arms and hands. She sips from a bottle of liquid and occasionally says something to the nurse or doctor.\n\nBut as a small crowd begins to form around her, we are asked to give Josepha her privacy.\n\nFriday, July 20, 11:00 a.m.\n\nGasol and Camps spend most of the day on Open Arms. Gasol even helps carry Josepha, whose legs are too weak to walk, from her room to the fresh air of the main deck. Josepha, he says, is \"happy, but it's going to be tough for her now because she's going to face a different scenario. And we got to give her time because it's not easy to go through what she went through -- and now deal with a lot more.''\n\nDuring the visit that day, Camps gives Josepha the rosary presented to him during one of his visits with the Pope. In turn, Scaccabarozzi presents Camps with a statement dictated by Josepha to one of the aides.\n\n\"I was at sea with many people from Africa,'' the letter begins. \"When they abandoned me, they all left with another boat. I thought I was already dead.''\n\n\"I'm not afraid,'' another part of her letter states. \"And then I started singing a song. When I finished the song, I fell asleep until the moment I found myself here in this boat. Here I'm with people with a big heart.''\n\nOnce back on the Astral, Camps shares more photos, and the crew begins telling stories to Gasol and the other volunteers. They tell of a rescue in which three Libyans were found in a tiny raft. They wore hats, and in the raft they had a guitar and a case of beer. They told their rescuers, \"If we were going to die, we were going to die happy.''\n\nThe final decision has been made: The ships will dock in Palma.\n\nSaturday, July 20, 6:19 a.m.\n\nPALMA, Mallorca -- As the sun rises, we can see the capital city of Mallorca in the distance. A Guardia Civil boat monitors our arrival, as do two boats with TV crews.\n\nGasol arrives on deck with a cup of coffee, crackers and his cell phone. \"4G!'' he says, the connectivity bars in full force.\n\nAnother police boat arrives as we get closer to the harbor. Open Arms moves slowly to the left, ordered by the port authority to dock at a different area than the Astral is headed to.\n\nAt 9:22, Gatti turns off those two Caterpillar diesels. Dock workers secure the ship. The mission is complete.\n\nFour police officers board the Astral, do a quick check and leave. We are told that Josepha will be taken to a local hospital. She has 30 days to apply for political asylum. Camps says Proactiva will assist in any way possible on her behalf.\n\nGasol gathers his things. He will soon join Camps, Gatti and the Open Arms captain to testify about the rescue to maritime authorities at a Saturday morning hearing. A news conference is scheduled for 12:30 p.m.\n\n\"I think now we have a responsibility to explain and show the world what we witnessed,'' he says.\n\nGasol says that if he didn't have to return to his own family in Barcelona, \"I would not leave the boat.'' He is still wearing his Astral T-shirt, given to him when he boarded the yacht the previous Monday.\n\n\"To be part of their team is like -- it's not a jersey that you put on. It's deeper than that, and you connect,'' he says. \"You're so vulnerable out there: your feelings, emotions, where you're at. Everything is so real and pure ... they have each other's back.\n\n\"I've been here, what, one mission? Saved one person. They've done 47 missions and saved over 60,000 people.''\n\nHe feels sheepish about being the center of this story, but he did so because of a cause he believes in.\n\n\"A lot of times people tell you what to do,'' he says. \"I'd rather show you what I do.''\n\nGasol says he will not tell his 4-year-old daughter, Julia, about where he has been or what he has seen. But if she persisted, what would he say?\n\n\"Daddy was helping people,'' he says. \"Daddy was helping people. He tried to do everything in his hands to help people.''\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nAccording to Open Arms officials, Josepha's physical condition has improved dramatically. She has since relocated to another European country and lives with a sibling. But when contacted in December 2018, she expressed her desire to one day meet Gasol and thank him for his work on the rescue mission.\n\nDuring that mission -- and the long hours at sea -- several crew members, including Kouperinis and Camps, asked Gasol about his upcoming 2018-19 season. At the time, Gasol had no idea that he eventually would be traded from the Grizzlies to the Raptors.\n\nHe told Kouperinis and Camps that if he reached the NBA Finals, they would be his guests at a game. And as always, Gasol kept his promise. Kouperinis and Camps were at Thursday's Game 1 in Toronto.",

Also watch out for Chinese Taipei's Chai-ming Chang, who was superb in the Asian Games and will aid Maninder in raiding duties.\n\nTL;DR: A superb auction for the Warriorz. Held onto their key man and brought in PKL's best defender in Fazel. Should reach the playoffs, at the very least.\n\nManinder Singh: How PKL's strongest raider became its most consistent\n\nBengaluru Bulls\n\nGrade: B-\n\nBest Signing: Ajinkya Pawar - a super fast raider, something that the Bulls really need.\n\nAuction summary: The Bulls really, really wanted Pawan to don their red jersey but lost out and instead brought in two raiders - Ajinkya and Pardeep Narwal, PKL's most successful raider of all time - for that price. Fun fact: Pardeep began his PKL career with Bengaluru Bulls, so the homecoming might just help him find his form again.\n\nThe Bulls also spent big money to get Jai Bhagwan for \u20b963 lakhs, giving them plenty of options in raiding. Saurabh Nandal was retained and he will marshal the defence, but they lack options in the cover positions.\n\nTL;DR: Went after Pawan again, did not get him again. Have three superb raiders and Pardeep's return is something to look forward to.x\n\nDabang Delhi KC\n\nGrade: B-\n\nBest Signing: No real impact signings.\n\nAuction summary: The former champions are typically known for their raiders and needed a left raider, which Siddharth Desai duly filled up. Naveen Kumar and Ashu Malik were retained and that sorts out Dabang Delhi's raiding requirements, but they did not get their target men in defence - they furiously bid for Fazel Atrachali and Sunil Kumar but couldn't get either of the two. It'll be interesting to see how Joginder Narwal, former Dabang Delhi player and now head coach, shapes up this young squad.\n\nTL;DR: They have a new-look team and a new coach, but their success will depend on how injury-free Naveen and Siddharth will be this season.\n\nGujarat Giants\n\nGrade: B+\n\nBest Signing: Guman Singh.\n\nAuction summary: Gujarat Giants went all-out to acquire the services of Guman Singh for \u20b91.97 crore, who will take charge of their raiding department. Guman was among the top 10 raiders last season and will have plenty of support from Rakesh HS and Parteek Dahiya. The Giants used their FBM card to retain Iranian all-rounder Mohammad Esmaeil Nabibakhsh and fortified their defence by adding Sombir and Neeraj Kumar to their ranks as coach Ram Mehar Singh yearns to bring back the glory days to the Gujarat side.\n\nTL;DR: Addressed all their needs well and have assembled a balanced unit, a good outing overall for them.\n\nHaryana Steelers\n\nGrade: A+\n\nBest Signing: Mohammadreza Shadloui, the most exciting prospect in the world of kabaddi today. He can defend, raid and lead a team, making him a proper asset.\n\nAuction summary: The runners-up of last season, Haryana Steelers had covered most of their bases before the auction itself by retaining the core of their team. They knew what they wanted and fought off multiple bids to sign up Iranian powerhouse Mohammadreza Shadloui, who was PKL 10's best defender. Shadloui doesn't just defend, he also doubles up a tricky raider and his arrival in the Haryana Steelers setup gives them that x-factor. Shaldoui, much like coach Manpreet Singh, is a showman and an aggressive player and this link up will be interesting to watch.\n\nTL;DR: Retained their core. Were a dangerous team last season, now they are even stronger with Shadloui's arrival. This could very well be their season.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers\n\nGrade: B\n\nBest Signing: Surjeet Singh. Veteran defender, slightly past his prime, but can single-handedly win matches, as he did for Bengaluru Bulls last season.\n\nAuction summary: The two-time champions had a very busy auction. They retained their best performers in Arjun Deshwal [joint-highest raid points in PKL 10] and the defensive unit of Ankush Rathee and Reza Mirbagheri. With that as a base, they assembled a formidable raiding line for PKL 11 by signing on well-known names such as Shrikant Jadhav, Vikash Kandola and Neeraj Narwal. Surjeet will lead the young defence, which will complement the Panthers' raiding quartet.\n\nTL;DR: Brought on three quality raiders and a seasoned campaigner in Surjeet to man the defence, but there's a shift in the team's balance as it looks more attack-oriented this time.\n\nArjun Deshwal - Jaipur Pink Panthers' raider for all seasons\n\nPatna Pirates\n\nGrade: B-\n\nBest Signing: South Korean raider Jang Kun Lee, who returns to PKL after four years.\n\nAuction summary: Patna Pirates, PKL's most successful team, bolstered their defence as they spent over \u20b91.8 crore to sign right corner Shubham Shinde, all-rounder Gurdeep and right cover Deepak Singh. However, their raiding unit looks a little underwhelming as M. Sudhakar and Meetu Sharma are the main options, while the three-time champs will hope Lee can hit the ground running and lead this young raiding duo.\n\nTL;DR: Not the best of outings. The defence looks strong, but they lack an in-form lead raider.\n\nPuneri Paltan\n\nGrade: A\n\nBest Signing: They signed the least players and the pick amongst them is Ajith Kumar.\n\nAuction summary: Puneri Paltan didn't even need to be at the auction. The reigning champions have the youngest squad in the PKL and held on to all their stars: Aslam Inamdar, Mohit Goyat, Akash Shinde, Pankaj Mohite, Abinesh Nadarajan, Gaurav Khatri, Sanket Sawant, Aditya Shinde. That's eight names, meaning their starting seven is already decided. They've added Ajith Kumar to their already-packed raiding team and he will have to do something extraordinary to get game-time in PKL 11's best attacking side.\n\nTL;DR: Didn't even need to be at the auction, they have pretty much the same team as last season and are well-poised t\\o become the first team since Patna to defend their title.\n\nTamil Thalaivas\n\nGrade: A\n\nBest Signing: Sachin Tanwar - a brilliant raider and an expert of the do-or-die raid.\n\nAuction summary: Tamil Thalaivas have a squad that many will envy - Narender Kandola as a left raider, Sachin as a right raider, Sagar Rathee and Iran's Amirhossein Bastami on the right in defensive positions and Sahul Gulia in the left corner. They've got the best men in all the key positions and Iranian all-rounder Moein Safaghi slots in as an additional option. Sachin's arrival will unlock the true potential of this young, but lethal squad.\n\nTL;DR: Tamil Thalaivas have covered all their bases and are among the most balanced teams going into PKL 11.\n\nTelugu Titans\n\nGrade: B-\n\nBest Signing: Pawan Sehrawat. Retained him for \u20b91.725 crore by using the FBM card.\n\nAuction summary: elugu Titans pulled off a smart move by releasing Pawan and brought him back on board at a lower price via their FBM card. They've once again built their team around Pawan, who will have more support in raiding this time around from Vijay Malik. The defence has also been strengthened as Krishan Dhull [PKL 10's second-best defender] has joined the side as they bid to end their miserable run of finishishing at the bottom of the table for three consecutive seasons.\n\nTL;DR: Held onto Pawan and have shored up their defence, but the majority of the squad is still young and lacks experience. However, veteran coach Krishan Kumar Hooda's arrival is a positive as the Titans aim to make their first playoff appearance\n\nU Mumba\n\nGrade: A+\n\nBest Signing: Sunil Kumar - one of the smartest captains on the mat and the architect of Jaipur Pink Panthers' win in PKL 9.\n\nAuction summary: U Mumba have re-united Sunil and Parvesh Bhainswal, who at one time, were the most feared defensive pairing in PKL. The two senior campaigners add sting to the U Mumba defence that was earlier led by Rinku. The season two champions also splurged to get Manjeet on board, who will be the lead raider alongside Iranian all-rounder Amirmohammad Zafardanesh.\n\nTL;DR: U Mumba have a formidable defensive line-up, a solid raiding unit and are primed to make it to the top-six.\n\nUP Yoddhas\n\nGrade: B\n\nBest Signing: Bharat Hooda. He was a tad off last season, but is a very clever raider and could be the answer to the Yoddhas' mis-firing raiding unit.\n\nAuction summary: UP Yoddhas released all their big names and shuffled up their squad for PKL11. They've replaced Pardeep Narwal with Bharat Hooda and Bhavani Rajput and already have Surender Gill with them - three tall raiders with excellent pace and reach. The defensive side of things also got an uplift with the signings of right cover Sahul Kumar, Iran's Mohammadreza Kaboudrahangi and the muscular Mahender Singh.",

    "raw_text": "It was quite the eventful 2024 NFL season, full of surprises, both positive and negative. Fantasy football managers must now decide what to believe and what not to believe moving forward. Perhaps we can help. If any of these thoughts come true for the 2025 NFL season, well, don't be surprised!\n\nNOTE: All references to fantasy points are for PPR scoring.\n\nDon't be surprised if ... Puka Nacua becomes the first to 2,000 receiving yards\n\nWe just saw Saquon Barkley become only the ninth RB to rush for 2,000 yards, but nobody has ever reached that mark for receiving yards. Nacua seems as likely a choice as any to become the first. He has played in 28 NFL games over two seasons, averaging 88.4 receiving yards per game. By comparison, Ja'Marr Chase averaged 100.5 yards per game this season -- tops in the sport -- but he sits at 87.5 receiving yards per game for his four-year career. Justin Jefferson has averaged 96.5 yards per game in his career, highest of all time. Nacua isn't far from that mark.\n\nNacua caught 990 yards worth of passes this season, but he did so over just nine full games and brief parts of two others. He caught 1,486 yards worth of passes as a rookie last season (87.4 YPG). This season, he averaged 90.0 yards per game, although if we focus solely on his final eight games, that average jumps up to 104.7. If he plays in all 17 games next season, that pace would translate to 1,780 receiving yards. To get to 2,000, he would need to boost his average to 117.6.\n\nThere's a good reason why no wide receiver has reached 2,000 receiving yards in a season, but things are trending upward. It's difficult to play at such a high level for four months, acknowledging dependence on top-notch QB play as well. Detroit legend Calvin Johnson finished the 2012 season at 1,964 yards. The 4-12 Lions stunk, but QB Matthew Stafford and Johnson were great together. Nacua's teammate Cooper Kupp got to 1,947 yards in 2021, with Stafford again approaching 5,000 passing yards. They won a Super Bowl. I don't think Stafford is done yet. Nacua is just starting out.\n\nDon't be surprised if ... Ja'Marr Chase slips outside the top 5 WRs\n\nChase is awesome, having just registered only the 14th season in history of at least 1,700 receiving yards. He's a different awesome than Barkley is -- because he's younger and a wide receiver. While wideouts depend on their QB more than running backs do, pitfalls remain. Chase was extremely motivated this past season as he, ahem, chased a historic contract extension. We are kidding ourselves if we pretend it didn't affect his performance. Also, the Bengals and their sputtering defense created weekly deficits that forced QB Joe Burrow to throw 652 times. No other QB approached 600 passes. This isn't likely to repeat.\n\nChase finished both 2022 and 2023 outside the top-10 WR scorers (WR12 and WR13, respectively), so if we are using multiseason averages to project ahead, Jefferson (a top-six WR in all of his four full seasons and WR2 this season) and CeeDee Lamb (last season's WR1, and this season's WR2 before sitting out the final two games) would get the nod over him. Little separates these players. Chase figures to get his new contract, but the Bengals might lose free agent WR Tee Higgins this offseason.\n\nThe obvious consensus will rank Chase as the top WR going into 2025 and perhaps even as the overall No. 1 player off the board (as I do), but I would also argue you shouldn't want the No. 1 pick. Jefferson, Lamb, Nacua, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Malik Nabers (just give him a passable QB and he would be a likely dynasty No. 1 overall choice) and several others are similarly qualified as we statistically project ahead. Give me a late first-round pick -- and the subsequent early second-rounder -- every time.\n\nDon't be surprised if ... Jahmyr Gibbs becomes fantasy's top RB\n\nSpeaking of first-round picks ... most fantasy managers will make 2,000-yard rusher Barkley the No. 1 RB in 2025 drafts. That's fine. I have Bijan Robinson first. Gibbs, however, scored the most PPR points at the position this past season, making an elite closing run as he piled on 126.1 points over the final four games (including 46 in the finale). Detroit's offense is elite. Gibbs did this somewhat by necessity, with Lions tandem partner David Montgomery (knee) out.\n\nStill, Gibbs did achieve this and the Lions certainly recognize that they can depend on him for more volume, with or without Montgomery. Gibbs was underutilized in the passing game for much of the season, even as he finished with 52 receptions, tied for sixth among running backs. The Lions should rely on Gibbs far more than Montgomery, and they likely will (to some degree) in 2025. Do not assume this timeshare continues with the same delineation of duties moving forward. Gibbs sailed past 350 points this season, but he can do more.\n\nDon't be surprised if ... Barkley becomes a (modest) bust\n\nBarkley may well have broken Eric Dickerson's 40-year-old record had the Eagles needed a win in Week 18. It may appear difficult to note anything negative here ... except history tells us that running backs coming off their 2,000-yard campaigns haven't come close to repeating the performance the following season. Start with O.J. Simpson five decades ago and go all the way to Derrick Henry just a few years ago. Not one of them came within 500 rushing yards of 2,000 the following season, although a few did later in their careers.\n\nYes, several of those players missed games due to injuries -- which may or may not be coincidental considering the physical toll it took to rush for 2,000 yards the year prior. Perhaps it's like a baseball pitcher logging a heavy workload and/or pitching deep into the postseason, and then the following year, look what happens.\n\nOne more thing: several of these backs didn't even finish as fantasy's RB1 during their 2,000-yard season -- receiving counts in PPR! This includes Dickerson, who was only RB3 in 1984.\n\nLook, you might not want to hear it -- nor do Philadelphia Eagles fans -- but it is so difficult to repeat as fantasy's top, well, anything. Barkley turns 28 on Super Bowl Sunday. He handled the football a career-high 378 times (345 carries) this regular season, and he has a history of dealing with injuries. The Eagles presented him the perfect statistical opportunity, with a running threat at QB, a top offensive line, smart coaching and ample volume. This was the first time Barkley crossed 1,400 rushing yards in seven seasons. Few expect another 2,000-yard campaign, but how far will he drop off?\n\nWe shouldn't expect Barkley to bust in the practical sense of the word. He should remain among the most productive RBs and I rank him as RB3 for 2025, after Robinson and Gibbs. Still, we cannot gloss over prior concerns about missing games. We had these concerns this past summer. Nobody expects him to be next season's version of Christian McCaffrey, but there is downside. Eager fantasy managers might make Barkley the No. 1 overall player. That would be risky and hopeful. Wide receivers are far safer, more reliable and able to duplicate workload.\n\nDon't be surprised if ... three NFC East passers are top-10 QB scorers\n\nJalen Hurts of the Eagles and Commanders rookie Jayden Daniels starred this season, but Dak Prescott struggled in his half-season before a hamstring injury ended things prematurely. Then again, Prescott was 2023's QB3. Don't bet against Prescott returning to prominence. In fact, if the Giants draft the right QB (Colorado's Shedeur Sanders, for instance), perhaps all four of this division's QBs will end up in the top 10.\n\nOut of sight often means out of mind, so it is likely Prescott slips quite a bit in fantasy drafts in comparison to his 2024 ADP. While I don't generally believe in most \"every other season\" themes, for Prescott, something odd is going on. Prescott was the No. 2 fantasy QB in 2019, falling to No. 7 in 2021 and back to No. 3 in 2023. Injuries curtailed his 2020 and 2022 seasons. We have little reason to question Prescott returning to full health in 2025, but it won't stop fantasy managers from fading him anyway. Don't let him fade too far.\n\nDon't be surprised if ... the 2025 Seahawks become the 2024 Lions, in the backfield\n\nNo RB duo matches what Detroit achieved this past season, as the Gibbs/Montgomery pairing (over 14 games) combined for nearly 600 fantasy points, with more than 3,000 total yards and 32 touchdowns. Montgomery averaged 15.8 points per game, ranking him among the top-15 running backs.\n\nThen again, in Seattle, Kenneth Walker III (11 games) and Zach Charbonnet both approached 200 points. Charbonnet really thrived when Walker was out, scoring 38.3 points in Week 14, and 25.7 points in Week 3. They combined for 17 TDs. Somehow, despite this electric duo, only four teams rushed for fewer yards than Seattle. This offense would be better served feeding Walker and Charbonnet and avoiding the chance for another 15 interceptions from Geno Smith, just one off the league lead.\n\nOther quick hits for 2025 that should not surprise you\n\nTrey McBride leads all TEs with 10 TD grabs: There was no good reason for McBride to post nary a TD catch prior to the penultimate week of the season. Red zone targets were not an issue, and he enjoyed solid QB play. McBride finished with two TD grabs. In 2025, watch McBride turn his luck around and pile on the touchdowns. It seems only fair.\n\nTravis Hunter gets drafted too high in fantasy: As with every rookie, we do not know for sure where Hunter, the Colorado Buffaloes' hybrid WR/CB -- or is it CB/WR? -- ends up, but chances are the NFL's version of baseball great Shohei Ohtani will become a bit too popular in standard fantasy drafts.\n\nCaleb Williams and Michael Penix Jr. are top-15 fantasy QBs: These guys are good. Get ready for WR Rome Odunze breakout time, too.\n\nJoe Burrow, still great, is not a top-5 fantasy QB: Running counts, too. Bo Nix and Drake Maye -- no, really -- may have better chances.\n\nDerrick Henry leads the NFL in rushing for the third time: He isn't Barkley, but he came close this season (1,921 yards), and he will be a significantly better draft-day value. Ignore his age, for now.\n\nKyren Williams leads the league with 16 rushing TDs: He has had 31 rushing scores over the past two seasons, so this isn't much of a reach.\n\nJaylen Wright leads the Dolphins in rushing yards: Meanwhile, De'Von Achane catches 100 passes.\n\nIsaac Guerendo leads the 49ers in rushing yards: Meanwhile, Christian McCaffrey catches 35 passes. Sorry. I'm not investing early again.\n\nMike Evans makes it 12-for-12 in 1,000-yard seasons: Meanwhile, Chris Godwin scores more fantasy points. Godwin was on his way this season.\n\nMalik Nabers leads all flex-eligible players in fantasy points: Just. Get. Him. A. Quarterback.",

    "raw_text": "Season 10 of the Pro Kabaddi League [PKL 10] drew to a close with Puneri Paltan rubber-stamping their tag as arguably the League's best team ever by winning their maiden title.\n\nPuneri Paltan became the second team to clinch the PKL trophy after leading the charts at the end of the league stage. They beat Haryana Steelers in the final, who themselves had a fabulous season. The first-time finalists fought off the traditional PKL heavyweights and handed defending champions Jaipur Pink Panthers a thrashing in the semifinals as well.\n\nAfter 137 matches played across 12 cities over 13 weeks, we assess how each team fared in PKL 10, look at what made them tick (or didn't), and grade them (A+ being highest, F- being lowest).\n\nBengal Warriors\n\nGrade: D\n\nWhat worked: The most successful raiding unit in PKL 10. They had the most raid points [504], averaged nearly 23 raid points per game and that nearly carried them into the playoffs. Warriors are the only team to have two raiders - Maninder Singh and Nitin Kumar - in the top-10 standings.\n\nWhat did not work: Bengal Warriors had the least successful tackles in PKL 10. They scored the lowest tackle points, which is in stark contrast to how good their raiding was.\n\nBest player: Maninder Singh, PKL's Mr. Consistent. He wasn't as good as his previous seasons - finishing three points shy of 200 raid points - but did well to take the side as far as he could. Shubham Shinde was fantastic in defence, while Nitin proved himself as a solid secondary raiding option.\n\nTL;DR: Just not good enough this season. Won just four of their last 10 matches, a poor stat for a team as good as Bengal Warriors.\n\nPKL @10: A gamechanger for the sport, challenge is to build on the success\n\nBengaluru Bulls\n\nGrade: C\n\nWhat worked: Not a whole lot: they do not have a single raider or defender in the top 10 of the respective lists.\n\nWhat did not work: Bengaluru Bulls had the last effective raiding department in PKL 10. They managed just 406 raid points in 22 games, the least among the 12 teams. None of their raiders had any sort of impact this season.\n\nBest player: Surjeet Singh, fresh from winning the Asian Games gold medal, was Bengaluru Bulls' best-performing player this season. He took charge of the team when they were in the doldrums with some sharp defensive performances, one of which saw him scalp eight tackle points against Patna Pirates. Young raider Sushil also gave a good account of himself.\n\nTL;DR: A season they would want to forget.\n\nDabang Delhi\n\nGrade: A\n\nWhat worked: This side largely functioned on two factors: Ashu Malik's superb raiding and a young defensive unit led by Yogesh. If not for these two, Dabang Delhi would not have reached the playoffs.\n\nWhat did not work: Absolute lack of raiding options. Ashu Malik single-handedly scored over 50% of the team's raid points, but no one else chipped in. Here's a stat: Dabang Delhi's second-best raider after Ashu is Naveen Kumar. And he played just six games before getting injured.\n\nBest player: Ashu Malik. Took over captaincy duties after Naveen Kumar's injury and it brought out the best in him. He seamlessly transitioned into the role as he guided his young team, while also letting his raiding do all the talking. He finished PKL 10 as the season's #1 raider.\n\nTL;DR: Did very well to make it to the playoffs despite Naveen's injury. Ashu is a star in the making.\n\nGujarat Giants\n\nGrade: A\n\nWhat worked: Options on the bench. Coach Ram Mehar Singh has the advantage of turning to his bench whenever the situation demands it and they have more often than not delivered. It was Sonu Jaglan initially and then Parteek Dahiya, who won games as substitutes before gradually finding a place in the starting seven.\n\nWhat did not work: Gujarat Giants roped in the Iranian duo of Fazel Atrachali and all-rounder Mohammad Esmaeil Nabibakhsh...but they just did not make the kind of impact the team needed. Fazel, as captain, steered his boys into the top-six but as a defender he could have played more aggressively. Nabibakhsh, on the other hand, hardly found form.\n\nBest player: Prateek Dahiya. Wasn't Gujarat Giants' first-choice raider, but did well to earn a place in the starting seven after being on the bench for long periods. He's quick, agile and a great exponent of the running hand touch. Top scored for the team with 141 points.\n\nTL;DR: A good young team with superb bench strength but did not live up to expectations.\n\nPKL @ 10 Awards: Pardeep Narwal, Pawan Sehrawat, Fazel Atrachali, the best of the first decade\n\nHaryana Steelers\n\nGrade: A+\n\nWhat worked: Everything, pretty much. As is the case with any team coached by Manpreet Singh, defence is supreme. Haryana Steelers are the only team to have three defenders in the top 10 and were the league's second-best defence. They led the charts for most Super Tackles [33] and their raiding squadron was fantastic. It all fell into place for them this season.\n\nWhat did not work: The lack of a marquee raider hurt them initially as Siddharth Desai did not step up. But Vinay Tewathia and Shivam Patare took on the raiding duties soon enough.\n\nBest player: Vinay Tewathia. His dodging skills are second to none and he has a unique ability to wriggle out of tackles. He has more often than not delivered for Haryana Steelers and was PKL 10's eighth-best raider.\n\nTL;DR: A beautiful underdog story. Stunned defending champions to reach the final, missed out on a maiden title by three points. Their best-ever season to date.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers\n\nGrade: A-\n\nWhat worked: They enjoyed great squad stability by retaining their core from last season. Since the players were already comfortable playing with each other, they were able to hit the ground running and play their best kabaddi.\n\nWhat did not work: The supporting raiders did not deliver. While Arjun did the bulk of the raiding, the likes of Ajith Kumar and Bhavani Rajput collectively scored 142 points - which is 134 less than Arjun's tally.\n\nBest player: Arjun Deshwal. Finished joint on points with Ashu Malik on the raiding charts. He shouldered the raiding responsibilities smoothly, averaging 12 points per game and bagging the most Super 10s [17].\n\nTL;DR: Had a superb league-stage campaign, were unbeaten for a record 13 games, fell short of their title defence in the semifinal.\n\nArjun Deshwal - Jaipur Pink Panthers' raider for all seasons\n\nPatna Pirates\n\nGrade: C+\n\nWhat worked: A fairly well-balanced unit. The raiding and defence units complimented each other and that did the trick for them. The raiding, in particular, was impressive as they amassed 495 points [second-most in PKL 10].\n\nWhat did not work: They struggled to maintain momentum or seize chances to close out games, which proved to be too costly. Case in point: the semifinal against Puneri Paltan where had a narrow lead and a chance to grab an All Out but failed to.\n\nBest player: Sachin Tanwar. He had a great season as a raider and also as a captain. He bailed his team out of many a tricky do-or-die situation and rotated his squad well. Special mention to Sudhakar M and Sandeep Kumar - two young raiders who showed just what they are capable of doing on the mat.\n\nTL;DR: Could have won their fourth title but lost meekly when it mattered the most.\n\nM Sudhakar ready to be Patna Pirates 2.0's Pardeep Narwal\n\nPuneri Paltan\n\nGrade: A+\n\nWhat worked: Everything.\n\nWhat did not work: Hardly anything. Almost everything they touched turned into gold.\n\nBest player: Very hard to pick one because the team as a whole was simply outstanding. But a large portion of their success has to be attributed to their captain Aslam Inamdar. He threw himself on the line, preferred other raiders over himself, doubled up as a defender when needed and ensured good vibes among his team. A superb leader, who deservedly won the MVP of the season award.\n\nTL;DR: The greatest PKL team ever. Period.\n\nTamil Thalaivas\n\nGrade: D\n\nWhat has worked: This is a side that is known for their defence and that lived up to the billing. They are second only to Puneri Paltan when it comes to average tackle points [13.41] and were the third-best defensive team in PKL10. The raiders, Narender Kandola and Ajinkya Pawar did well to finish among the top 15 but were just not consistent enough.\n\nWhat did not work: Something we had written about earlier: their poor strategy in the final few minutes. Their strategies were awry, they did not time their raids properly and improper calculations saw them lose at least three, very winnable, games. That is one of the main reasons they missed out on the playoffs. They also severely lacked consistency.\n\nBest player: Sahil Gulia. The left corner enjoyed a brilliant season and often rescued Tamil Thalaivas from precarious situations. He manned the defence alongside skipper Sagar Rathee and was ranked #7 among defenders.\n\nTL;DR: Good defence, but match strategy (especially last five minutes) needs a thorough re-look. Oh, and they became the first team to score more than 70 points in PKL history.\n\nTelugu Titans\n\nGrade: F-\n\nWhat worked: Nothing. From team selection [they had 10 PKL debutants in their squad of 18] to strategy and execution, they had little to celebrate about.\n\nWhat did not work: Everything.\n\nBest player: Pawan Sehrawat. He finished as the third-best raider with 202 points, but that did not change his team's fortunes.\n\nTL;DR: A miserable season for them. Just two wins in 22 games. Third season on the trot where they've finished at the bottom of the table.\n\nUP Yoddhas\n\nGrade: E\n\nWhat worked: Very little. A weak defence, underperforming raiders...nothing to really rave about this side. An 11th place finish will sting and that should motivate them to do better next time around.\n\nWhat did not work: The raiding unit was abysmal. Pardeep Narwal, PKL's #1 raider, finished with 122 points...this is a player who has the record of scoring 300+ points across two seasons. Surender Gill's injury only made matters worse.\n\nBest player: Sumit. The left corner was their best performer in PKL 10 and was the 14th-best defender with 61 tackle points. Special mention to young raider Gagana Gowda, who had a brilliant few games at the end. He's one for the future.\n\nTL;DR: For a team of their calibre, finishing with just four wins is criminal. They need to improve on every aspect of their game and pray and hope that Pardeep can find some semblance of form soon.\n\nU Mumba\n\nGrade: B\n\nWhat worked: Their raiding department worked well, with Guman Singh leading the young brigade. He's ranked #9 this season and had able support from Amirmohammed Zafardanesh. U Mumba had the fourth-best raiding total of the season.\n\nWhat did not work: The defence left a lot to be desired. U Mumba does not have a single defender ranked in the top 20 and had the third-least tackle points [227]. They have big names in their squad like Mahender Singh, Surinder Singh and Sombir, but lacked that killer instinct.\n\nBest player: Amirmohammed Zafardanesh. The young Iranian was a breath of fresh air with his lightning-quick raids and by the end of it, some mean ankle holds too. He's a great prospect and someone you'd expect to go from strength to strength, especially since he's working with coach Gholamreza Mazandarani.\n\nTL;DR: Looked like serious playoff contenders at one point and then spiralled down to the 10th spot.",

    "raw_text": "A groundbreaking record was set in the women's game over the summer, with total international transfer spending reaching $6.8 million from June 1 to Sept. 1 2024, according to FIFA -- almost double what was spent during the same period in 2023.\n\nSo will that momentum continue in January? Here are grades for all the major confirmed transfers in the women's game, with each listed in order of date and then highest fee.\n\nAll fees are reported unless confirmed with an asterisk.\n\nJan. 30\n\nChloe Kelly\n\nLoan\n\nManchester City: C\n\nArsenal: B+\n\nIt has been one of the biggest sagas of the January window. Twelve months ago, the idea of Kelly leaving Manchester City to join Arsenal would have been inconceivable. Now, though, it's reality.\n\nFrom an Arsenal point of view, it's a smart addition. Kelly hasn't been at her best for some time now, but she's still a player with enormous quality and, in the right environment, could thrive. The fact she has only signed on loan makes it a relatively risk-free transfer for Renee Slegers' side and she offers them another dangerous attacking option.\n\nFrom City's perspective, the nature of Kelly's exit leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. She might not have featured prominently this season but she is still a top player, and losing her to a direct rival after the player released a very honest statement about her situation on social media is a blow. -- BL\n\nJenna Nighswonger\n\n\u00a380,200 ($100,000)\n\nGotham FC: C\n\nArsenal: B\n\nYou don't earn 18 caps for the United States without being a very good player and that is why Nighswonger is a very shrewd addition for Arsenal. At 24, the left-back already has a wealth of experience at the elite level, having been part of the squad that won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer. With Steph Catley now playing more frequently as a centre-back, Arsenal needed depth at left-back, and Nighswonger's arrival will allow Republic of Ireland international Katie McCabe to be rotated or pushed higher up the pitch. She's not a transformational signing, but she should add plenty of quality to the squad.\n\nFrom a Gotham perspective, losing a U.S. international just as she is approaching her prime years is a blow. However, the club are used to navigating a relatively high turnover of players and will likely feel they can find an adequate replacement before the NWSL season starts in March. -- BL\n\nJan. 26\n\nNaomi Girma\n\n\u00a3881,000 ($1.1m)\n\nSan Diego Wave: B-\n\nChelsea: A+\n\nIt has happened! The first $1m signing in the women's football is USWNT defender Naomi Girma. Chelsea were willing to pay the largest-ever fee to sign the defender along with the high wages that come with signing such a big name. It is surprising, though, that it is a defender who broke the world record. The past three deals to do so (Racheal Kundananji, Mayra Ramirez and Keira Walsh) were either forwards or midfielders, but this just highlights a lack of world-class defenders, meaning top clubs like Lyon and Chelsea were willing to pay the big bucks to sign one. She is arguably the best centre-back around currently.\n\nFor Chelsea, the signing only strengthens an already stacked squad but comes at a crucial time with the side on course for the Quadruple. With the Wave now under the new leadership of Jonas Eidevall, it did seem surprising that the San Diego club were willing to let their premier defender go. After losing star forward Jaedyn Shaw, too, the Wave are in a transition period and as general manager Camille Ashton told ESPN, this is a time for the club to \"reshape and to build.\" -- EK\n\nJan. 21\n\nKerolin\n\nUndisclosed\n\nNC Courage: B-\n\nMan City: A\n\nKerolin, the 2023 NWSL MVP, is set to inject flair into City's forward line at a crucial moment, especially with Lauren Hemp sidelined due to injury. The Brazilian's arrival comes at an ideal time, as winger Chloe Kelly is expected to leave at the end of her contract in the summer-or potentially on loan during the January window. By securing Kerolin, manager Gareth Taylor is strategically bolstering his options in wide attacking positions in the present and thinking for the future.\n\nKerolin's talent has caught the attention of top WSL clubs like Manchester United and Arsenal previously, which was why City were eager to secure her signature. Previously a key player for NC Courage, Kerolin's absence due to an ACL injury last year was a major blow, but since her return in September, the team has adapted well, softening the impact of her loss. -- EK\n\nAlanna Kennedy\n\nUndisclosed\n\nMan City: B-\n\nAngel City: B\n\nIt seems like a strange move for Manchester City to let defender Kennedy depart while Alex Greenwood is still ruled out with a knee injury, leaving their options for centre-back dangerously thin. They have already signed one central defender, and it would be silly to assume Gareth Taylor would not look at a second option to bolster the defence.\n\nKennedy had spells of time confined to the bench, but without Greenwood available, there seemed no better time for the Australian to gather momentum and playing time than now.\n\nIt is a positive addition for Angel City, who finished 12 in the NWSL table last season and conceded the second most goals, 42, during the 2024 campaign. -- EK\n\nJan. 18\n\nKatherine Kuhl\n\nUndisclosed\n\nArsenal: C-\n\nRoma: A\n\nThe Gunners signed Kuhl to be the next big thing two years ago, and after being a vital edition during Arsenal's injury crisis at the end of 2022-23, hopes were high for the youngster's future. But after struggling for game-time last season, she was sent on loan for the remainder of the campaign to Everton. Still, despite positive praise and minutes with the Merseyside club, she returned to north London and was confined to the bench, claiming just six minutes from the first sector.\n\nIt is not a surprise, given the fact that the Gunners have a plethora of midfield options, that Kuhl departed for a chance to play more game time, however, it is a worrying pattern for Arsenal, who have failed to integrate a crop of academy youngsters for several years and failed to build up their acquired young talent. Summer signing Rosa Kafaji is in a similar position, making only one start this season thus far.\n\nIt is a great deal for Roma, who could use some extra talent to bolster their battle against Juventus for the title, and could extend their chances of reaching the Champions League again next season. -- EK\n\nAemu Oyama\n\nUndisclosed\n\nWaseda University: B\n\nMan City: A\n\nCity are in the midst of an injury crisis and need as many signings as they can to bolster the team and add depth. Manager Gareth Taylor has attracted several young talents, especially from Japan, and harnessed their technical ability to advance his side.\n\nOyama is the fifth Japan international to sign for City in the past three years. Summer signing Aoba Fujino, 20, has improved the club's creativity but has not produced as many goals as desired, so 20-year-old midfielder Oyama should add attacking depth. -- EK\n\nJan. 15\n\nLize Kop\n\nUndisclosed\n\nLeicester City: C\n\nSpurs: B+\n\nLeicester are stuck at the bottom of the table, one point shy of the relegation zone and have struggled with injuries this season. But despite their standing, their defensive record is not that bad, only conceding 13 goals this season, so letting go of a goalkeeper with Kop's potential is interesting, given how heavily Leicester have relied on the Netherlands international to rotate with Janina Leitzig.\n\nSpurs were in desperate need of reinforcements after Barbara Votikova departed after one season. Becky Spencer has been a stalwart between the sticks, but she is now 33 years old, meaning the club need to look to bring in their future No. 1 to learn under her guidance. Kop has potential, as she is only 26, but is already a top class goalkeeper. -- EK\n\nJan. 9\n\nMarta\n\nFree\n\nOrlando Pride: A\n\nIn what might be one of the biggest twists of this transfer window, free agent (her Orlando contract expired at the end of 2024) Marta signed a new two-year deal with the NWSL champions, keeping her at the club until 2026.\n\nMarta, who is 39 next month, helped the Pride to their first title and won a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics with Brazil. So it is a big deal for Orlando to retain the one of the world's most iconic players. -- EK\n\nJulia Bartel\n\nLoan\n\nChelsea: A\n\nLiverpool: A\n\nWhen Bartel signed for Chelsea from Barcelona in the summer, it very much felt like she was a player for the future. At just 20 years old, it was always going to be difficult for the midfielder to break straight into the Chelsea first team and so it has proven. She had made just two appearances for Sonia Bompastor's side this term, totalling 25 minutes. She's likely to get ample playing time on Merseyside and should return to Cobham in the summer as a more seasoned player.\n\nFor Liverpool, this is another shrewd acquisition. Manager Matt Beard has spoken about funds being limited at the club and bringing in Bartel, as well as Bayern Munich loanee Sam Kerr, should add some extra quality in the middle of the park. Though Bartel is young, she has extensive experience from her time with Barcelona's B team as well as from youth international football with Spain, winning the U20 Women's World Cup in 2022 and the U19 Women's European Championship on two occasions. -- BL\n\nJan. 8\n\nHayley Ladd\n\nUndisclosed\n\nMan United: B-\n\nEverton: A\n\nLadd's Manchester United exit has felt inevitable for some time now. The Wales international has made just three WSL appearances so far this term, with United boss Marc Skinner having bolstered his midfield in the summer transfer window. With Euro 2025 coming up in the summer, Ladd's need for minutes means her move to Everton makes a lot of sense.\n\nHer departure leaves United a little bit light in the middle of the park, which could come back to haunt them as they bid to secure Champions League qualification. But, for Everton, Ladd's arrival is a continuation of some shrewd January business, with the 31-year-old bringing plenty of quality and experience to Walton Hall Park. -- BL\n\nSam Kerr\n\nLoan\n\nBayern Munich: B\n\nLiverpool: A+\n\nLiverpool manager Matt Beard tried to sign Kerr two years ago, but has finally landed the Scotland international. Kerr, 25, not to be mistaken for namesake Australia international and Chelsea forward Sam Kerr, signed for Bayern in 2023 but has struggled for game time, only making two starts so far. She has found it tough to break into Alexander Straus' star-studded lineup, so a loan is the right option for both club and player. However, Bayern fans will be concerned that any further injuries could leave options a little light.\n\nFor Liverpool, Beard admitted that they are probably getting a more advanced player following her 18-month stint with the German champions, making it a perfect signing at the right time for the Merseyside team. Beard admitted before the winter break that he had a limited budget in this window, but if this loan spell is successful they may look to make a permanent offer. -- EK\n\nJan. 7\n\nEmma Watson\n\nLoan\n\nMan United: B\n\nEverton: A\n\nAfter suffering an ACL injury early in her Manchester United career, the Scotland international talent is set to make the most of a fresh opportunity to play. While Watson impressed in a brief appearance for United in the League Cup, she has struggled to secure a regular spot in the starting XI following her recovery. With Marc Skinner's lack of rotation, a loan move makes sense for the club.\n\nIn addition to Watson's departure, United have also loaned out fellow young talent Jess Simpson to Bristol City, ensuring both players have the opportunity to gain valuable playing time and continue their development.\n\nEverton have long been adept at leveraging the loan system to strengthen their squad, and this move is no exception. Despite the backing of the Friedkin Group, Everton's budget still lags behind that of the top clubs, but the loan market allows them to maximise their resources and reinforce a team that have struggled with injuries. -- EK\n\nJan. 4\n\nMartina Fernandez\n\nLoan\n\nBarcelona: A\n\nEverton: A\n\nNot only is this a great signing for a club like Everton, who know how to get the best out of budding young talents, but it is mutually beneficial for her parent club, Barcelona.\n\nFollowing comments from players like Aitana Bonmati -- explaining how Liga F needs to do more to raise the stakes and competitiveness of the league -- it is no surprise that Barcelona are starting to send handfuls of their up-and-coming youngsters to England and other top leagues to gain experience.\n\nFernandez, 20, is following the path to gain vital playing time and experience, making it a perfect signing for both clubs, especially Barcelona, as she would not have had the same opportunities in the B side. -- EK\n\nJan. 3\n\nOlivia Holdt\n\nUndisclosed\n\nRosengard: B-\n\nSpurs: A\n\nRosengard are losing plenty of talent in this window, already saying goodbye to two players who helped steer them to the Swedish league. This happened to Hammarby in the summer and is a plot fall of the Damallsvenskan acting as a feeder for more established clubs in Europe.\n\nBut it's a positive move for the youngster who has started to become integrated into Denmark's national team and fills a gap in Spurs' midfield. The club have struggled to rejig the side following Grace Clinton's departure back to Man United and the losses of Maite Oroz and Kit Graham. While the former is expected to return for the second half of the season, Holdt will be a key addition as coach Robert Vilahamn looks to solidify their mid-table stance. -- EK\n\nJan. 1\n\nRebecca Knaak\n\nLoan\n\nRosengard: C\n\nMan City: A-\n\nMan City were in engulfed in an injury crisis in the latter part of last year, losing Risa Shimizu, Lauren Hemp, Khadija \"Bunny\" Shaw, Naomi Layzel, Vivianne Miedema and Alex Greenwood. The side desperately need reinforcements, especially in defence with Greenwood set to be sidelined for several months. Knaak is experienced in Germany and Sweden, so will bring a level of composure, but she is uncapped for the senior national team. Despite this, she helped to steer Rosengard to the Swedish league in November and knows what it takes to win.\n\nDespite being a defender, she netted 16 goals in 36 appearances and clearly caught the eye of City's new Head of Women's of Football, Therese Sj\u00f6gran, formerly of Rosengard as a player and director. City need to rebuild if they want to keep pressure on Chelsea at the top of the table and Knaak will prove key in bolstering the back line. -- EK\n\nKelly Gago\n\nUndisclosed\n\nNantes: B\n\nEverton: A\n\nEverton's budget has improved significantly after the Friedkin Group takeover, allowing them to sign Gago. The Toffees have struggled with injuries since last season, including ACL's to Aurora Galli and Inma Gabrarro. Sitting 12th in the table, they need points to avoid relegation and are especially lacking in goals, with the third-lowest tally in the league.\n\nGago, a 25-year-old forward with solid experience in mid-table European clubs, including 44 goals in 88 appearances for AS Saint-\u00c9tienne, is a positive signing to bolster the side. Recently called up to the France national team, she'll get a bigger platform and a more competitive league at Everton to showcase her talent. -- EK",

    "raw_text": "Now that we've released our 2025 ranking of the top 100 prospects in baseball, it's time to turn our attention to the players who just missed the cut on this year's list.\n\nWhile the top 100 is exactly that long by definition, it is also a round-number cutoff that excludes many talented players with a chance to be true impact MLB stars.\n\nWith that in mind, we ranked the next 100 prospects and identified which players in this range are most likely to make a leap into the top 50 of next year's rankings, compete for 2025 MLB Rookie of the Year honors or lead the league in a specific category someday.\n\nWhether you are looking to be the first in the know about your favorite team's next emerging star, find some deep fantasy baseball sleepers or just want more prospect rankings, let's dig in.\n\nJump to: Full rankings of Nos. 101-200\n\nThe Nos. 101-200 prospect most likely to ...\n\nMake the 2026 top 50\n\nFranklin Arias, SS, Boston Red Sox (Ranked No. 102)\n\nArias just missed the top 100, offering the best combination of age and tools, with a chance to prove himself with a full season in Single-A. He has progressed like the top prep players from the 2024 draft and has a better hit tool than either of the top picks -- Konnor Griffin and Bryce Rainer (both in the top 100) -- with raw power the reason he's ranked behind them. (Arias projects as average to a tick above in the big leagues.)\n\nFor Arias to make the top 50 next winter, he would likely need to be in High-A around midseason with numbers similar to his 2024 aggregate line across the Rookie and Low-A levels.\n\nAlso considered: Two other infielders from the AL East -- Theo Gillen/Rays (138) and Roderick Arias/Yankees (103) -- were in the mix for this spot along with two outfielders from the division -- Miguel Bleis/Red Sox (115) and Brailer Guerrero/Rays (122) -- and an outfielder from the defending champs -- Eduardo Quintero/Dodgers (106).\n\nBe a 2025 Rookie of the Year candidate\n\nJace Jung, 3B, Detroit Tigers (117)\n\nJung looks like he'll be in the Opening Day lineup as Detroit's regular third baseman, at least against right-handed pitchers, and there isn't anyone else in Nos. 101-200 who figures to have that sort of opportunity at the beginning of the season. He's a below-average runner and defender but has plus power and patience along with enough feel for the bat head to put up an above-average offensive line this season.\n\nAlso considered: Four potential starting pitchers -- Jake Bloss/Blue Jays (118), Nolan McLean/Mets (123), Thomas Harrington/Pirates (162) and Brant Hurter/Tigers (159) -- were in the mix here along with four potential multi-positional prospects who could be broken in with major league platoon/utility roles -- Luisangel Acuna/Mets (154), Chase Meidroth/White Sox (199), Adrian Del Castillo/Diamondbacks (172) and Tyler Black/Brewers (166).\n\nLead MLB in home runs at their peak\n\nLazaro Montes, RF, Seattle Mariners (178)\n\nMontes doesn't offer a ton when it comes to speed, defense or positional value, but he hit 21 homers across both Single-A levels last year as a teenager. The underlying data and eye-test both back up that he should continue doing this as he goes up the chain with 30-homer potential on paper, but anything is possible with strength gains and one wild season.\n\nAlso considered: Some others in the mix here were picked more for raw power and in-game power potential or indicators rather than just being the players who hit the most homers last year. Thayron Liranzo/Tigers (108) is a catcher, while Ralphy Velazquez/Guardians (143) used to be, but moved to first base, which is where you'll find Ryan Clifford/Mets (131), at least part of the time. Elian Pena/Mets (183) is likely a third baseman who signed with the Mets weeks ago for $5 million at age 17. Spencer Jones/Yankees (130) is trying scouts' patience but has among the best power potential in the minors.\n\nWin a batting title\n\nJames Triantos, 2B, Chicago Cubs (181)\n\nTriantos is a pure fit for this title, as his bat is his only above-average tool, and his bat control might be his only plus skill, in keeping with MLB batting-average idol Luis Arraez. Triantos did steal 47 bases despite having average speed, but the sales pitch here is an incredible contact rate while being passable at a few positions defensively.\n\nAlso considered: There are some slick-gloved middle infielders -- Welbyn Francisca/Guardians (101), Jeremy Rodriguez/Mets (174), Luis Pena/Brewers (145) -- who were under consideration, some with less defensive ability -- Cooper Ingle/Guardians (200), Chase Meidroth/White Sox (199), Mike Boeve/Brewers (194) -- and you could also include Gillen or Quintero from above groups here.\n\nLead the league in stolen bases\n\nJustin Crawford, CF, Philadelphia Phillies (113)\n\nYep, the son of Carl Crawford is really fast and really good at stealing bases. His scouting report is a little tricky because he has some raw power but doesn't lift the ball and has incredible bat-to-ball ability, but he chases out of the zone far too much. While his plus-plus running ability has led to stolen bases, he is just OK defensively in center field. His baserunning is more refined, stealing 99 bases in his pro career, good for an 83% rate of success.\n\nAlso considered: It's all center fielders -- Nelson Rada/Angels (185), Luis Cova/Marlins (186), Luis Guanipa/Braves (140) and shortstops -- Yairo Padilla/Cardinals (146), Seaver King/Nationals (137) -- in this group. Unsurprisingly, they're all good defenders, too.\n\nBecome a front-line starter\n\nLuis Perales, RHP, Boston Red Sox (119)\n\nPerales was starting to turn the corner last spring, adding more precision to his high-octane stuff and area command. After nine sparkling starts, he went down with elbow soreness that led to Tommy John surgery that kept him from being comfortably in the top 100. He should return to the mound in the fall/winter of 2025 and has two plus-plus pitches (four-seamer and cutter) that headline his potent mix.\n\nAlso considered: There are some contenders for this title who have upper-minors experience -- Cooper Hjerpe/Cardinals (110) and Nolan McLean/Mets (123) -- along with three pitchers from the 2024 draft class -- Jurrangelo Cijntje/Mariners (141), Cam Caminiti/Braves (164), Kash Mayfield/Padres (196) -- three lower-minors prospects from East Coast teams -- Santiago Suarez/Rays (124), Alex Clemmey/Nationals (152) and Noble Meyer/Marlins(133) and another pitcher who had elbow surgery during a breakout 2024 season -- Owen Murphy/Braves (142).\n\nThrow 200 innings in a season\n\nAndrew Morris, RHP, Minnesota Twins (156)\n\nYou have to have some love for the potential innings eaters, even if they can't really do that in the minors, due to the shorter season, innings limitations and how long it takes to build up a starter's innings -- especially because they don't fit any of the other categories.\n\nMorris was a nice find in the fourth round of the 2022 draft by Minnesota who now has four above-average pitches and starter command in addition to reaching Triple-A last year and throwing 133 innings in total.\n\nAlso considered: All of the other contenders for this honor are also in the upper minors in large part because a lower-minors pitcher who is in the top 200 is there due to stuff, not durability. The lefties -- Samuel Aldegheri/Angels (111) and Justin Wrobleski/Dodgers (149) and righties -- Jake Bloss/Blue Jays (118), A.J. Smith-Shawver/Braves (128), Thomas Harrington/Pirates (162), Mason Barnett/Athletics (184), Ben Kudrna/Royals (160), Winston Santos/Rangers (150) -- are all nice examples of prospects who may be in more demand than their ranking suggests, given the inflation in starting pitcher free agent contracts.\n\nBecome an elite closer\n\nLuis Morales, RHP, Athletics (114)\n\nThis is the most fun group within these lists: the pitchers with big raw stuff who are still putting it together, but you can imagine almost anything. If they were clear one-inning relievers, they wouldn't have made the top 200.\n\nMorales is among those with the highest upside of any arm in the minors, with the components of starter command (but a ways to go in realizing that) along with two plus-plus pitches in his four-seam fastball and sweeper, though his curveball flashes plus and his changeup isn't that far behind. If the feel to turn over a lineup doesn't come, he could be a menace in the late innings.\n\nAlso considered: Brody Hopkins/Rays (134) is basically a coin flip with Morales for this spot as they have a lot in common. Every one of Hopkins' six pitches is plus on paper due to its velocity and movement, but his command may never be average. That makes him likely a reliever, but he's a former collegiate two-way player so he hasn't played enough to say that for sure. You could also throw Luis Perales/Red Sox (119) into this group, but he has the most command of these three.\n\nNoble Meyer/Marlins (133) from the above group also fits here, while Cade Cavalli/Nationals (175), Will Warren/Yankees (158), David Sandlin/Red Sox (169), and Grant Taylor/White Sox (198) are all on the starter/reliever spectrum but dominate in the late innings if starting doesn't work out.",

    "raw_text": "The Miami Heat suspended Jimmy Butler again Monday, the third suspension for their disgruntled star over the past month but the one that appears to signal the end of his six-year tenure with the team.\n\nThe Heat said the latest suspension -- triggered by Butler walking out of practice after hearing the team planned to bring him off the bench -- will take this ongoing drama through the NBA trade deadline on Feb. 6.\n\nThe indefinite suspension all but closes a complicated chapter of Butler's 14-year career. A six-time All-Star, an Eastern Conference finals MVP and the leader of two teams that went to the NBA Finals, Butler has taken each of his four franchises to heights they have struggled to replicate without him.\n\nYet Miami is seeing firsthand how uncomfortable Butler can make life when he is unhappy. His exit strategies have become legendary: confrontational practice sessions, clashes with coaches and an overall push to make the situation untenable. Butler already had missed nine of Miami's past 12 games with suspensions, the first being seven games for conduct the Heat deemed detrimental and the next for two games for missing a team flight to Milwaukee last week, before his latest penalty on Monday.\n\nIf Butler has played his final game for the Heat, then it's a chance to take a look back at the veteran's tumultuous NBA career and how each situation devolved from promising potential to painful breakup.\n\nChicago Bulls (2011 to 2017)\n\nOctober 2014: Butler turned down a reported four-year, $40 million offer from the Bulls following a career year. He believed he could make more after the following season.\n\n2014-16: During his rise with the Bulls, Butler ran into issues with veterans Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah. Both were traded following the 2015-16 season.\n\nJuly 9, 2015: After turning down an extension the previous season, Butler signed a five-year, $90 million max contract.\n\nDec. 20, 2015: Following a loss, Butler criticized new coach Fred Hoiberg. \"You got to hold everyone accountable; everybody has to do their job,\" Butler said.\n\nJanuary 2017: With tension in the locker room growing, Rajon Rondo stood up for the younger Bulls players in a meeting. The rift led to fines for Butler, Rondo and Dwyane Wade after their remarks went public.\n\nJune 22, 2017: Butler was traded to Minnesota for Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and the No. 7 pick in the 2017 draft after a drama-filled season in Chicago.\n\nButler arrived in Chicago as the 30th pick in the 2011 draft, but quickly ascended up the depth chart.\n\nHe did not play much as a rookie, but by his third season, he developed into a consistent starter, carrying the team while Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah were sidelined by injuries. By Year 4, Butler made his first All-Star team and ushered the Bulls into a new era, shifting from a team led by Noah and Rose into one centered on its emerging superstar. And Butler was intent on putting his stamp on the franchise, demanding the same dedication it took for him to rise from the end of the bench to star player at all levels.\n\nThe Bulls hired Fred Hoiberg as coach in 2015 and he immediately clashed with Butler, who signed a new five-year max contract. By December, Butler was criticizing Hoiberg after games, saying he needed to coach harder. Butler also clashed with Noah during the 2015-16 season, which led to heated disagreements throughout the year, sources told ESPN at the time. Chicago put together the misguided three alphas of Butler, Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo for the 2016-17 season in an attempt to compete, but after a first-round playoff exit, the Bulls fielded multiple calls for Butler on draft night 2017 -- the second straight year they tried to trade him at the draft -- before finally sending him to Minnesota.\n\nThe deal marked the end of the Butler era in Chicago. It also sent the Bulls into a rebuild from which they haven't recovered. Chicago has made the playoffs only once since trading Butler, when it lost in the first round in 2022 against the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2017 to 2019)\n\nJan. 16, 2018: Only months into his time with the Timberwolves, Butler called out the team's attitude on the court. \"I'm glad we lost,\" he said following a defeat to the Orlando Magic.\n\nJuly 3, 2018: Following Minnesota's first-round loss to the Houston Rockets, sources indicated that Butler was \"fed up\" with the Wolves' young roster, including forward Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\nJuly 13, 2018: After the disappointing playoff exit, Butler turned down a four-year extension.\n\nSept. 20, 2018: Ahead of the 2018-19 season, Butler requested a trade from Minnesota.\n\nOct. 10, 2018: In his first practice since requesting a trade, Butler yelled at Minnesota general manager Scott Layden as the team scrimmaged. \"You f---king need me, Scott. You can't win without me,\" Butler said. He played with bench players during the practice and famously beat the starters and \"regulars\" throughout the scrimmages.\n\nOct. 10, 2018: Later that day, Butler sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols to discuss the heated practice and his future with the franchise.\n\nNov. 10, 2018: A month later, the Wolves agreed to trade Butler to Philadelphia for Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick.\n\nButler's trade from Chicago reunited him with his former Tom Thibodeau. Butler's first season in Minnesota was a success, as he made the All-Star team for the fourth consecutive year and led the Wolves to the postseason, breaking a 13-year drought of playoff basketball. However, Butler missed 17 games late in the season, and the Timberwolves tumbled from fourth in the standings to eighth. They were quickly dispatched by the top-seeded Houston Rockets. The following summer, Butler and the Wolves were not able to reach a contract extension, leading to trade rumors that began swirling by the start of training camp.\n\nButler missed the first two weeks of camp after requesting a trade, and when he returned, he unleashed his frustration on the rest of the team in a now-famous practice session. He dominated his teammates on the court and yelled at them off it, targeting his ire at Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, Thibodeau and then-Wolves GM Scott Layden, whom Butler told, \"You f---ing need me.\"\n\nAnd yet, Butler was in the starting lineup for the Wolves when they opened the regular season, though his tenure in Minnesota was all but over. After a two-month saga, Butler played 10 games for the Wolves to begin the 2018-19 season before being sent to Philadelphia in November.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers (2018-19)\n\nNov. 12, 2018: The trade was completed, with Butler and Justin Patton arriving in Philadelphia.\n\nJan. 4, 2019: A few months into Butler's tenure on the 76ers, the All-Star aggressively challenged coach Brett Brown's big three hierarchy and his own role on offense.\n\nThe Sixers, with their trio of Joel Embiid, reigning Rookie of the Year Ben Simmons and Butler, were positioned right away to be a contender in the Eastern Conference and provide a payoff to fans who had just lived through \"The Process\" rebuilding years. Though Butler wasn't eligible to sign an extension immediately, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported at the time that the forward and the Sixers fully expected to reach a deal on a long-term contract in the summer. But six weeks into Butler's tenure, he \"aggressively challenged\" coach Brett Brown during a film session, leading to another rift. Butler would go on to criticize Brown's playcalling and put him on blast often in front of the media throughout the season.\n\nButler played in only 55 games for the Sixers, but he provided highlights, game winners and fourth-quarter takeovers that seemed to prove his point to Brown that more of the offense should be centered around him. Butler was brilliant in the postseason, especially during a thrilling seven-game, second-round series loss against the eventual NBA champion Toronto Raptors.\n\nButler was eligible to sign a five-year, $190 million deal with the 76ers in the offseason, but the team elected instead to bet on Tobias Harris, who had been acquired from the LA Clippers in a trade two months after Butler arrived in Philadelphia. The Sixers facilitated a sign-and-trade deal to send him to Miami while bringing Josh Richardson to Philadelphia, though the shooting guard lasted just a season there before being shipped to Dallas. Brown was fired as coach after the following season, and Philadelphia still hasn't made it beyond the second round of the playoffs since 2001.\n\nThree years later Butler exclaimed \"Tobias Harris over me?!\" after the Heat defeated the 76ers in the playoffs.\n\nMiami Heat (2019 to present)\n\nMarch 23, 2022: Jimmy Butler, Udonis Haslem and head coach Erik Spoelstra got into a heated argument during a timeout in a close game against the Golden State Warriors. Haslem and Butler were shouting at each other, and Spoelstra slammed a clipboard on the floor in frustration. The Heat went on to lose their fourth game in seven matchups.\n\nMay 6, 2024: During an end-of-season news conference, team president Pat Riley addressed some of Butler's on- and off-court antics surrounding the playoffs. Butler sprained a knee in the play-in tournament and did not play in the first round of the playoffs. When asked about Butler's behavior, Riley said, \"If you're not on the court playing against Boston, or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nJune 26, 2024: Butler and the Heat failed to agree to an extension ahead of the 2024-25 season.\n\nDec. 10, 2024: The Heat said they were open to potential trades for Butler.\n\nDec. 26, 2024: After ESPN's Shams Charania reported that Butler preferred a trade out of Miami, Riley announced in a statement, \"We are not trading Jimmy Butler.\"\n\nDec. 31, 2024: When asked if he wants to be in Miami, Butler responded simply, \"That's a good question.\"\n\nJan. 2, 2025: Butler indicated to the Heat that he would like to be traded. \"I want to see me getting my joy back playing basketball. Wherever that may be, we'll find out here pretty soon,\" Butler said.\n\nJan. 14, 2025: In a face-to-face meeting with Riley during his suspension, Butler reiterated his demand to be traded.\n\nJan. 22, 2025: Butler was again suspended, this time for two games. The latest instance was for missing a team flight.\n\nJan. 23, 2025: Following another suspension, Spoelstra told the Heat roster to \"get used to\" and \"get over\" the constant news surrounding the situation.\n\nJan. 27, 2025: After being told he was being replaced in the starting lineup, Butler walked out of practice, leading to his third suspension of the month. He is now suspended indefinitely.\n\nThe Heat executed a four-team trade to sign Butler to a four-year contract in 2019, and it was instantly a perfect marriage of player and team. The term \"Heat Culture\" was born and seemed tailor-made for Butler. It was a mantra that fit Butler's ideology as a player who had worked his way from the end of the bench to stardom, as well as the Heat's success in turning unheralded players into playoff contributors.\n\nThe Heat went to the NBA Finals during the 2020 bubble, dragged there by Butler, who leaned over the guardrails in exhaustion during a game, an image that would become a meme. In 2021-22, Miami was the No.1 seed in the East and missed returning to the Finals by one game, when a furious comeback in the fourth quarter of Game 7 against the Boston Celtics fell just short as Butler missed a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 16 seconds left. A year later, the Heat got revenge on the Celtics, holding off a 3-0 comeback to win in Game 7 in Boston and return to the Finals, this time as a No. 8 seed. Butler's playoff performances became so iconic, the nickname Playoff Jimmy began to stick.\n\nBut Butler's postseason performances began to stand in contrast to his regular-season production, especially as injuries kept him out of a combined 40 games during the past two seasons. Butler also missed the Heat's entire first-round playoff loss to the Celtics in 2024 with a sprained MCL but said later during a radio interview that if he'd been healthy, the Heat would have beaten the Celtics, who went on to win the title. Heat president Pat Riley directed a comment toward Butler at his end of the season news conference, saying, \"If you're not on the court playing ... you should keep your mouth shut.\" Then, Riley declined to reward a maximum contract to Butler at age 35, despite the two NBA Finals appearances, again reiterating his desire for the veteran to be on the floor more often.\n\nButler dropped the antics he had become known for on media day -- emo hair in 2023, dreadlocks the year before that -- and said he wanted to focus on the season ahead. But in December, ESPN reported that Miami was open to trading Butler. When Riley issued a statement the day after Christmas that the Heat \"are not trading Jimmy Butler,\" it was unclear to whom the declaration was directed -- the public or Butler. Meanwhile, Butler was missing in action for most of this time. He rolled an ankle Dec.20 and missed 13 days with an illness.\n\nHe returned for a back-to-back in the first two days of the new year, although Butler indicated the team accused him of not playing his hardest in the first game. After the second game, a blowout loss to the Pacers, Butler said he had lost his joy for basketball and that it could \"probably not\" be found in Miami.\n\nButler was suspended for seven games Jan. 3, a day after the rant, as Miami issued a second statement: \"Jimmy Butler and his representative have indicated that they wish to be traded, therefore, we will listen to offers.\"\n\nIn a meeting with Riley during that suspension, Butler said he would not sign a new deal in Miami and intended to use his $52 million player option for 2025-26 only as a trade maneuver, sources told ESPN's Shams Charania on Jan. 14. Butler returned for three games, but then received a second suspension Jan. 22 after he missed a team flight to Milwaukee. After he sat out two more games, the team indefinitely suspended Butler on Monday. The third suspension came when the disgruntled star walked out of morning practice after the Heat told him he'd come off the bench moving forward. Now, he'll be suspended for at least five games, which runs through the Feb. 6 trade deadline.",

    "raw_text": "January is a time for mistakes -- in the soccer world, at least. While everyone takes a step back and resolves to find ways to improve during the first month of the year, soccer clubs tend to double down on what they've already done wrong.\n\nActivity in the January transfer window has very little correlation with increased success. Lots of strikers signed in January don't score a single goal from here on out, and most title-chasing teams that sign new players actually see their overall performance decline.\n\nSo, as the January window winds to a close, what better time to take a step back and celebrate everyone's biggest mistakes? I've identified the worst mistake made by each Premier League club over the past five years, and then ranked them against each other, in descending order.\n\nAll transfer data comes from the site Transfermarkt\n\n20. Ipswich Town\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Acquiring Sammie Szmodics from Blackburn for \u20ac10.60 million\n\nI feel bad A) even including Ipswich Town here, and B) singling out Szmodics. Ever since the club hired Kieran McKenna as manager in 2021, they've nailed just about everything you can reasonably expect to nail. There's really no other way to go from the third tier to the first tier in two years.\n\nSzmodics, though, was the kind of low-ceiling, low-floor move that promoted teams -- especially ones with league-low budgets like Ipswich Town -- can't really afford to make. He massively outperformed his expected-goal total in the Championship last season, and those 23 non-penalty goals were, by far, a career-best. Before that, he'd scored 11 goals in the Championship -- across two seasons. The rest of his career was spent in League One and League Two.\n\nNot only were Ipswich acquiring a player after an outlier season; they were bringing him in at the tail-end of his prime. Szmodics turned 29 in September; he's scored four goals so far this season.\n\n19. Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Transferring Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool for \u20ac42m\n\nWe're picking nits here, as this is one of the best-run teams in all of sports. But in the summer of 2023, no less than 16 midfielders moved for a higher fee than what Brighton received from Liverpool. Since then, Mac Allister has emerged as one of the most reliable midfielders in the world. The crowd-sourced Transfermarkt values aren't inarguable truths, but his value has risen up to \u20ac80m since he arrived at Anfield.\n\nAlmost every other major transfer out of the club has been a \"win\" for Brighton -- meaning more money in than whatever value that player is able to provide to his new team. While there were some reports that Liverpool activated a release clause in Mac Allister's contract, the explanation doesn't really matter, as this is one of the few deals that it seems like Brighton might've \"lost.\"\n\nStill, that loss is only a loss measured against their impeccable track record. They acquired Mac Allister for just \u20ac8m, four years before he left for over five times' that amount.\n\n18. Brentford\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Acquiring Igor Thiago from Club Brugge for \u20ac33m\n\nBrentford have seemingly built their team around all of the things we do and don't know about how soccer actually works. They spend on attackers and center backs -- the positions that directly influence goal-scoring and prevention -- and shy away from investing in the harder-to-quantify performance of midfielders.\n\nWhile it's harder to describe good center-back play with on-ball statistics, we're pretty good at quantifying centerforward performance through expected goals. The best goalscorers are the ones that get on the end of the most high-quality chances; not the ones who convert their chances at the highest rates. This idea still hasn't solidified into conventional wisdom, and Brentford have been able to exploit it by acquiring undervalued strikers who do the fundamentals well but suffer a season of unsustainably poor finishing.\n\nThis works in the other direction, too: Brentford can move on from forwards who inflate their own values with a season of unsustainably excellent finishing.\n\nSince they've been so good at identifying undervalued forwards -- and so willing to eventually move them on -- five of their nine biggest transfer fees received came from centerforwards. And the two best players on the current roster, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, are forwards, too.\n\nGiven all that, I wouldn't give up hope on forward Igor Thiago just yet, but Brentford made him their club-record transfer over the summer. Thanks to a knee injury and then a reported joint infection, he's only played 130 Premier League minutes and attempted a single shot for the club.\n\n17. AFC Bournemouth\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Replacing Eddie Howe with Jason Tindall\n\nWithout Eddie Howe handling the major personnel decisions, Bournemouth really haven't made any major mistakes since he stepped down after the club were relegated in 2020. It's even hard to say that it was a mistake to hire Scott Parker. Yes, they got outscored 16-2 during his four Premier League games in charge, but he helped get them promoted the year prior, and they also immediately cut bait once they realized it wasn't working.\n\nAfter the 2019-20 season, Howe was replaced at Bournemouth by his assistant Jason Tindall. He lasted a little over half a season in the Championship before being replaced by Jonathan Woodgate, who led the team on a winning run that earned the Cherries a spot in the Championship playoff.\n\nIf Tindall's name sounds familiar it's because you've seen his face before: he's the guy who stands next to Howe on the Newcastle sideline every weekend and screams at the ref, opposing players, or even the other team's coach.\n\n16. Fulham\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Acquiring Anthony Knockaert from Brighton for \u20ac11.7m\n\nWhen Fulham got promoted in 2018, they signed a ton of players that a lot of people liked ... and they finished 19th. When they were promoted in 2020, they took the opposite approach: a couple small, permanent deals and then a number of loans.\n\nTheir biggest outlay was the nearly \u20ac12m paid to make a permanent move for 28-year-old Knockaert from Brighton after a successful loan. Knockaert retired this past summer after playing zero Premier League games for Fulham. And while Fulham are firmly established in mid-table now, they were relegated once again after the 2020-21 season.\n\n15.Newcastle United\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Giving a direct rival their best midfielder and best striker\n\nYou can't really blame Newcastle for not seeing Forest's rise coming, but you also can't really say anything other than: Newcastle directly fueled Nottingham Forest's rise!\n\nChris Wood joined last summer on a permanent deal from Newcastle, and he's currently fourth in the league in goals scored. Elliott Anderson, meanwhile, joined this past summer, and he's leading Forest with 66 line-breaking passes completed, per data from PFF FC. The main way that Forest move the ball up the field is through Anderson; the main way they convert that movement into goals is through Wood.\n\nOh yeah: as of this writing, Forest are three points ahead of Newcastle in the Premier League table.\n\n14. Crystal Palace\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Never getting anything for Wilfried Zaha\n\nThere was a time where it seemed like Palace would sign any 29-year-old dude who had played a couple seasons in the Premier League. But right around the turn of the decade, they started to get a lot smarter, scouring the Championship for young talent and bringing in a bunch of younger players from overseas.\n\nThe biggest error, then, of the past five years was to never get anything in return for Zaha.\n\nRather than seemingly accepting their place in the Premier League pecking order, Palace gave Zaha a really hefty contract, signed him to extensions, kept him for nine seasons, and then let him leave for nothing. Now, there's nothing wrong with this, in theory! Palace got nine solid seasons of performance from Zaha. He became a club-legend, and he's their best player of the Premier League era.\n\nBut Palace never finished below 15th or above 10th during his nine years with the team. And in the two seasons since his contract ran out and he signed with Galatasaray, they've finished in 10th and now sit in 12th. Wouldn't, say, an extra \u20ac50-60m -- the numbers rumored with a potential Zaha transfer almost every summer for nearly a full decade -- be the kind of thing that might have helped this club finally challenge for a European place?\n\n13. Arsenal\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Acquiring Kai Havertz from Chelsea for \u20ac75m\n\nI was going to go with the \u20ac50m Arsenal spent on midfielder Thomas Partey here. The team was in a rebuilding moment, and yet they decided to drop a lot of money on a midfielder at the tail end of his prime, who was emerging from the meat-grinder that is Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid. Partey has only played about 55% of the minutes since joining Arsenal, and he played fewer than 800 minutes last year, which was easily the best year of the Mikel Arteta era.\n\nExcept, given Arsenal's scoring issues, I have to go with Havertz -- a misunderstood player just like the next one on this list, who I also really enjoy watching.\n\nThe problem here isn't having Havertz on your team; Havertz would make just about any other team in the world better. And he's played a ton for Arsenal. The issue is that they paid Chelsea a lot of money at a time when Chelsea seemed desperate to move on. On top of that, he was brought in to play in the midfield, something that never panned out.\n\nInstead, he's spent most of his minutes at centerforward. He does all of the little things as well as anyone, but he just doesn't do enough of the main things. Since the start of last season, he's scored and assisted as many non-penalty goals as Chris Wood, and one fewer than Anthony Gordon and Jarrod Bowen.\n\n12. Liverpool\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Acquiring Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez from Benfica for \u20ac85m\n\nSomeone who works with some of the best clubs in the world put it to me like this. In the summer of 2022, Liverpool made Nunez their club-record signing. He was coming off a season in which he massively out-performed his expected-goal totals, he'd played particularly well against Liverpool in the Champions League, and he'd shown no ability to contribute in buildup play or out of possession in the same way all of Liverpool's other attackers had done as they nearly won four trophies in the 2021-22 season.\n\nThat same summer, Newcastle signed Alexander Isak, a 22-year-old striker who already had three seasons of above-average performance in a Big Five league under his belt, and who was coming off of a season in which he'd massively underperformed his expected-goal totals. Isak was similarly limited in buildup, but he had a longer track record in a tougher league, he was a year younger, and he cost \u20ac15m less than Nunez.\n\nIn other words, the team owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund got a better deal than the club that had spent the past five years nailing every transfer.\n\nI love watching Nunez, and when he played under Jurgen Klopp, his output was fast approaching world-class. He's a valuable and poorly understood player, but the reality is that he's Liverpool's most expensive signing of all time, and he's barely played half of the available minutes since he joined the club.\n\n11. Aston Villa\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Acquiring Philippe Coutinho from Barcelona for \u20ac20m\n\nI can't believe that move for the 29-year-old guy who barely played soccer for three years, but was friends with your coach, didn't work out!\n\nOf course, I'm being a little harsh. Coutinho was good in his half-season loan with Villa in 2021-22: a little over a goal-or-an-assist per 90 minutes. But after Villa made the deal permanent in the summer of 2022, they signed the Brazilian to a four-year deal, and he played about 800 more minutes for the club, scored one more goal, registered no more assists, and eventually left to go on loan to the Qatari league.\n\n10. Nottingham Forest\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: The entire summer of 2022\n\nThis was Forest's approach to the first offseason after achieving promotion: identify which professional soccer players exist, then attempt to sign every single one of them.\n\nIn the first two windows after promotion, Forest literally signed 30 different players. The wildest part: only three of them, Neco Williams, Morgan Gibbs-White and Chris Wood, have played significant minutes this season.\n\nWhile they did stay up in 2022-23, the whole thing came really close to ending in disaster. They ended the season in 16th, but tied for third-worst in goal differential (minus-30) and finished with the second-worst expected-goal differential in the league. Thanks to some good fortune, Forest survived and then got their act together over the next season-and-a-half. It really could've been so much worse.\n\n9. Everton\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Hiring Frank Lampard\n\nYour honor, I request that this piece of evidence be entered into the record:\n\nI rest my case.\n\n8. West Ham\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Acquiring James Ward-Prowse from Southampton for \u20ac34.8m\n\nWest Ham are the kings of suboptimal moves. OK fine, that's Manchester United, but West Ham are the princes of suboptimal moves. They keep signing big-name players right as they're aging out of their primes for a little more than they're worth. No single move feels too egregious, but you stack enough of those moves on top of each other, and the result is a team with a massive stadium and enough revenue to compete for a Champions League place sitting in 14th place with a minus-16 goal differential at the end of January.\n\nThe most egregious example of it all was the move for Ward-Prowse. He's an England international, and everyone knows he's one of the best free-kick kickers in the whole world. So, when West Ham signed a soon-to-be-29-year-old JWP in the summer of 2023, the move, like many others, was received mostly positively on British television and in the papers.\n\nBut here's the problem: soccer players tend to get worse once they hit their late 20s. Ward-Prowse, in particular, had already morphed into a player who didn't really do anything at even an average level other than serve the ball into the box. While he exceeded my expectations in year one at West Ham -- playing a lot, notching seven assists and five non-penalty goals -- he's already out on loan at Nottingham Forest, where he's played three total minutes since the calendar flipped to 2025.\n\n7. Wolverhampton Wanderers\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Acquiring F\u00e1bio Silva from FC Porto for \u20ac40m\n\nGiven the club's close connections with Portuguese super-agent Jorge Mendes, Wolves make it difficult to assess what they're actually trying to achieve with any given move. Most clubs are trying to win more games when they acquire a new player, while Wolves? Well, sometimes Wolves sign Fabio Silva.\n\nThey paid \u20ac40m to acquire the then-18-year-old center forward. And while big-money deals for teenagers have become normal over the past five or 10 years, spending that much on a guy who had started one game as a pro is not something we'd ever seen before or have seen since.\n\nIf I remove my cynicism for a minute and judge this as a normal transfer -- e.g. trying to value a player based on his expected future performance -- then it's one of the most absurd front-office decisions I've ever seen, in any sport. Wolves made a kid with 190 minutes of professional experience the most expensive transfer in the history of the club.\n\nWhatever the reason (good or questionable) Silva was signed, this move still helps explain why Wolves are now battling relegation instead of fighting for a Europa League spot like they were in their first few seasons after promotion. Back then, their agent connections allowed them to acquire players like R\u00faben Neves and Diogo Jota, who otherwise never would've signed with a midlands club in the Championship. Now, their agent connections are helping them sign players whom no-one else would've ever considered signing for the same prices.\n\nSince joining Wolves in 2020, Silva has scored four non-penalty goals. He's currently on loan at Las Palmas.\n\n6. Tottenham\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Employing Jose Mourinho after Mauricio Pochettino\n\nFor nearly the entire Mauricio Pochettino era, Spurs were one of the better-run teams in the world. Sure, it helped that Harry Kane was in their academy, but they built one of the best teams in the world around him with what was mostly a collection of undervalued signings. Pochettino's eye for untraditional talent, combined with the club's ability to outbid pretty much every other club looking to sign anyone below the top-of-the-market talent, produced a Champions League final run and a two-year stretch in which Tottenham won more points than any other team in the Premier League.\n\nWhile Mourinho was hired a little over five years ago, he was still employed as Tottenham manager within the past five years, so I'm breaking my own arbitrary threshold because this was so obviously a massive mistake. Mourinho had badly flamed out at last two managerial stops, and it had become clear that his reactive coaching style both didn't jibe with the current generation of players and couldn't win enough points in a league with a Big Six and growing quality beyond it.\n\nMourinho lasted 17 months, didn't win anything, and cost the club tens of millions of dollars.\n\n5. Chelsea\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: The entire summer of 2022\n\nAfter taking over a club that finished third during the previous season and won the Champions League a year prior, new owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital decided they needed to spend roughly \u20ac288m on transfer fees in their first summer in charge. The players they brought in on permanent deals: Wesley Fofana from Leicester City, Marc Cucurella from Brighton, Raheem Sterling from Manchester City, Kalidou Koulibaly from Napoli, Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa, Cesare Casadei from Inter Milan, and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Barcelona.\n\nThis season, those players have combined to play 2,800 minutes in the Premier League for Chelsea. Most of them aren't even on the team right now. It's one of the worst individual transfer windows a club has ever had, and it should have tanked Chelsea's chances of building a competitive roster ...\n\n4. Manchester City\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Sending Cole Palmer to Chelsea for \u20ac47m\n\nCole Palmer might be the best player in the Premier League not named Mohamed Salah. And Manchester City sent him to a direct rival for less than Wolves paid for Matheus Cunha and Tottenham spent to acquire Brennan Johnson. Not great!\n\nMaybe they felt bad for the whole Kevin De Bruyne situation? Otherwise, it's hard to overstate how disastrous this is. Palmer is only 22, and is likely to be dominating the league for the next decade. Not only that, pretty much the entire viability of the new Chelsea project hinged on this transfer.\n\nHad Chelsea not whisked Palmer away from City, then they're probably not contending for the Champions League, and if they're not contending for the Champions League, then they're probably locked into a mediocre roster without any obvious paths to increasing revenue and improving for the next half-decade.\n\nT-2. Southampton and Leicester City\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Not signing established keepers in the summer of 2022\n\nAlthough Southampton and Leicester were both relegated after the 2022-23 season, neither club was destined to go down. By expected-goal differential, Southampton were tied with Wolves in 17th, while Leicester were all the way up in 14th:\n\nSo why did Southampton finish dead-last, 11 points from safety, and why did Leicester drop all the way down to 18th? The primary explanations are the same for both clubs: their keepers couldn't stop shots.\n\nPer Stats Perform's post-shot expected goals model, Southampton's Gavin Bazunu conceded an absurd 16.9 goals more than an average keeper would if he faced the same shots. Leicester's Danny Ward was much better than Bazunu, but still much worse than almost everyone else, conceding 5.5 goals more than expected. For a team that finished two points from safety, a goal or two saved could have been the difference.\n\nWhile no one could've expected these levels of performance from Southampton and Leicester's keepers, both clubs took risks at a position where risks really aren't worth it. Great goalkeeping can win you some extra points, but there's really an upper limit to how many shots a keeper can save; there's no real limit on how poorly a keeper can play.\n\nThe former gave the keys to 20-year-old Manchester City product Gavin Bazunu, while Leicester replaced club legend Kasper Schmeichel with Liverpool's Danny Ward, who at 29 had never been a starter in the top flight and hadn't been a starter anywhere since a 2016-17 season with Huddersfield in the Championship. Both were terrible, and both have since lost their starting jobs with their clubs.\n\n1. Manchester United\n\nBIGGEST MISTAKE: Acquiring Antony from Ajax for \u20ac95m\n\nThese are the two transfers that sandwich Antony's move to Manchester United on the list of the most expensive transfers of all time: Gareth Bale's move from Tottenham to Real Madrid, and Cristiano Ronaldo's move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. I, uh, yeah ...\n\nThere are a bunch of mistakes that could have landed United in first here -- bringing back Cristiano Ronaldo, paying massive wages and a huge transfer fee for 30-year-old Casemiro, bringing back Erik ten Hag because he won the FA Cup to name just three -- but we have to go with Antony.\n\nI mean, c'mon -- the guy looked terrible from the jump. He's scored five goals and added two assists across three seasons, and he plays the same position as Mohamed Salah and Bukayo Saka. While there was at least some upside to this deal compared to the Ronaldo and Casemiro moves -- Antony signed at 21 -- everything else about it stunk.\n\nUnited didn't seem to be competing against anyone to sign Antony, and yet they got bid into making him the second-most-expensive player in club history. They also convinced themselves that the best available player at arguably the most important position in the sport just happened to be the one who played for the coach they just hired.\n\nNeed more? On top of all of that, he wasn't even that good at Ajax! He scored 17 goals and 12 assists over two seasons in a league that massively boosts attacking performance, and for a team that, at the time, still had a massive financial advantage over the rest of the league.",

    "raw_text": "Just because the Super Bowl is nine days away doesn't mean you should forget about everything else that's going on in the NFL.\n\nFree agency is right around the corner -- the new league year begins March 12 -- and that means teams and players are already confronting some big-money decisions that will shape this offseason. Whether it's free agent deals like the one Saquon Barkley signed with the Eagles last year or huge contract extensions like we saw for Justin Jefferson in June, teams are planning their offseasons around major contract spends.\n\nSo, we consulted with a half-dozen executives and cap experts around the league and tried to predict what some of these contracts will look like when they do come in. We picked five pending free agents and five players who are still under contract but are due for extensions. Here's our best crack at projecting terms for 10 new deals.\n\nJump to:\n\nBaun | Chase | Darnold | Hamilton | Higgins\n\nParsons | Purdy | Smith | Stingley | Wilson\n\nFive top free agents\n\nSam Darnold, QB, Minnesota Vikings\n\nAge: 27 | 2024 stats: 4,319 passing yards, 35 TD throws, 12 INTs\n\nLast contract: One year, $10 million, $8.75 million guaranteed\n\nThe Vikings have talked about bringing Darnold back, even with 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy waiting in the wings to take over as the long-term starter at some point. (McCarthy first has to recover from his season-ending knee injury.) They could franchise tag him (roughly $40 million) with the intent of keeping him or possibly trading him, but odds are the market is going to offer Darnold more than Minnesota can afford. The Raiders, Giants, Jets, Steelers, Browns, Titans and Saints are among the teams that either will or could find themselves looking for a new quarterback this offseason.\n\nThe Vikings can pay receiver Justin Jefferson $35 million per year in part because it's anticipating operating on McCarthy's rookie deal. And in the end, they probably end up letting Darnold hit the market, where he should be able to command a deal in line with the three-year, $100 million deal that Baker Mayfield got from the Buccaneers a year ago -- though it would be adjusted upward based on inflation and market demand.\n\nPrediction: Three years, $120 million, $75 million guaranteed -- which would tie for 15th among quarterbacks in average annual value.\n\nRussell Wilson, QB, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nAge: 36 | 2024 stats: 2,482 passing yards, 16 TD throws, 5 INTs\n\nLast contract: One year, $1.2 million, fully guaranteed\n\nPittsburgh has two free agent quarterbacks -- Wilson and Justin Fields, who started the first six games of the season while Wilson recovered from a calf injury. The Steelers have a tough decision to make. Wilson started out hot once he got the job but fizzled toward the end of the season. After averaging 8.4 yards per attempt and posting a 59.3 QBR over Weeks 7-14, Wilson dipped to 6.4 yards per attempt and a 38.4 QBR over his final five starts, including the playoffs. Pittsburgh lost all five of those games.\n\nThe coaching staff liked the progress Fields was making while he was the starter, but they still benched him for Wilson and didn't use him a ton late in the season. Could there be an outside market for Wilson? Possibly, but the Steelers were the only interested team one year ago, and he didn't do a ton to improve his marketability.\n\nThis isn't like last year, either, when the money he made from the Steelers was offset against the guaranteed money the Broncos were still paying him. The Broncos don't owe him any more, so Wilson won't be available for a minimum salary as he was last season. The Giants took a cursory look at him before he went to Pittsburgh last year, and his old coach Pete Carroll just got the head coach job in Las Vegas, so there are some potentially intriguing options for Wilson if the Steelers don't bring him back.\n\nBut let's say Pittsburgh does bring him back on a short-term deal while it continues to look for a more sustainable long-term solution.\n\nPrediction: Two years, $50 million, $35 million guaranteed -- which would tie for 19th among quarterbacks in average annual value.\n\nTee Higgins, WR, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nAge: 26 | 2024 stats: 73 catches, 911 yards, 10 TDs\n\nLast contract: One year, $21.8 million (franchise tag)\n\nThe Bengals franchised Higgins in 2024 for $21.816 million, which means to do so again in 2025 would cost them $26.179 million. Given their history with the franchise tag -- and with teammate Ja'Marr Chase due for a pricey long-term extension -- it feels unlikely that the Bengals would use the tag on Higgins for a second time. Assuming the Bengals do plan to sign Chase and let Higgins go, Higgins should be the top target for any team looking for a No. 1 wide receiver in free agency this offseason. And with multiple teams likely bidding, his market could go through the roof.\n\nThere are some past injury concerns -- Higgins has missed five games each of the past two years -- that could keep the number under the very top end of the market, but he should do better than the guys who got extensions with years left on their deals last offseason. Some of the people I spoke to believe he could get a little more per year than Jaylen Waddle's $28.25 million average and a little more guaranteed than DeVonta Smith's $69.998 million.\n\nIt's also possible Higgins could benefit from a multiple-team bidding war and drive that number higher. The Patriots, Bills, Commanders, Ravens, Chiefs, Chargers and Panthers are just a few of the teams that could be looking to sign a high-end wide receiver this offseason.\n\nPrediction: Four years, $114 million, $70 million guaranteed -- which would be seventh among receivers in average annual value.\n\nTrey Smith, G, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nAge: 25 | 2024 stats: 17 starts, 93.9% pass block win rate\n\nLast contract: Four years, $3.6 million, $902,676 guaranteed\n\nSmith's rookie deal is up, and he was a sixth-round pick, so the Chiefs don't hold a fifth-year option on him. Chiefs center Creed Humphrey -- his 2021 draftmate -- got his big extension last offseason, landing a four-year deal worth $72 million. Smith is now a priority this offseason, as Kansas City tries to keep its elite interior offensive line group together. Smith's 95.6% pass block win rate since entering the NFL in 2021 ranks second at guard behind only Joe Thuney, who traditionally plays Kansas City's other guard spot. (He was moved to tackle this season.)\n\nThe offensive line franchise tag number is tied to top tackle pay, as it doesn't differentiate between tackles, guards and centers. So it will likely cost the Chiefs more than $25 million to franchise Smith for 2025.\n\nThe Eagles' Landon Dickerson is currently at the top of the guard market, earning $21 million per year. Based on what I'm hearing, it shouldn't be a problem for the Chiefs to give Smith a deal that at least matches that in terms of annual value and tops the $63 million in guarantees that Robert Hunt got from the Panthers.\n\nPrediction: Five years, $105 million, $65 million guaranteed -- which would tie for first among guards in average annual value.\n\nZack Baun, LB, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nAge: 28 | 2024 stats: 151 tackles, 11 TFL, 3.5 sacks, 1 INT\n\nLast contract: One year, $3.5 million, fully guaranteed\n\nThe Eagles landed Baun on a one-year, $3.5 million contract last offseason, and he turned into one of the top bargains in the league. He had a Defensive Player of the Year-caliber regular season, helping fuel a defensive turnaround that landed Philadelphia in the Super Bowl. He'll obviously be looking for much more on the open market, and the Eagles may not be able to keep him around. Per Roster Management System, Philadelphia has $7.9 million in cap space for 2025 and multiple free agents to consider.\n\nGetting to $15 million per year would put Baun in the top five at his position, behind only Roquan Smith, Tremaine Edmunds and Fred Warner.\n\nPrediction: Four years, $60 million, $35 million guaranteed -- which would be fourth among off-ball linebackers in average annual value.\n\nFive extension candidates\n\nBrock Purdy, QB, San Francisco 49ers\n\nAge: 25 | 2024 stats: 3,864 passing yards, 20 TD throws, 12 INTs\n\nRemaining contract: One year, $5.2 million\n\nPurdy's original salary for 2025 was a little over $1 million as part of the four-year rookie contract he signed after being the last pick of the 2022 draft. But proven performance escalators based on how much and how well he has played since becoming the 49ers' starter in 2023 have inflated it to a little over $5 million. (The official actual amount has yet to be determined and will be once the 2025 salary cap is set.)\n\nThe 49ers do not hold a fifth-year option on Purdy because he was not a first-round pick. So if he played out the 2025 season, he'd be either an unrestricted free agent or (much more likely) a franchise tag recipient in 2026. Purdy has led the 49ers to two NFC Championship Games and one Super Bowl appearance as the top bargain of the past three seasons in the entire league. Surely both sides agree that the time has come for a significant raise.\n\nThe threat of the franchise tag certainly gives the 49ers some leverage, and if Purdy's not determined to play hardball and max out his contract in the upper-$50-million-per-year range, there's a deal to be made here. Some of the people I talked to expect that the framework would likely build out from the contract Daniel Jones signed with the Giants two years ago (four years, $160 million with $81 million guaranteed). But it would obviously be adjusted upward for inflation and based on superior performance.\n\nPrediction: Four years, $196 million, $112 million guaranteed -- which would be 10th among quarterbacks in average annual value.\n\nJa'Marr Chase, WR, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nAge: 24 | 2024 stats: 127 catches, 1,708 yards, 17 TDs\n\nRemaining contract: One year, $21.8 million\n\nChase is scheduled to play 2025 on the fifth-year option from his 2021 rookie contract, but he was clearly unhappy to not get an extension last offseason. He \"held in\" throughout Bengals training camp, and he's likely willing to push even harder this time around. The top of the wide receiver market right now is Chase's college teammate and friend Justin Jefferson, who's making $35 million per year on the deal he signed with the Vikings last offseason. Chase posted enormous numbers in 2024, strengthening his case to surpass Jefferson's contract.\n\nThe Bengals have a long-held policy of refusing to guarantee any money beyond the signing bonus in long-term veteran contracts (other than Joe Burrow's deal), and if Chase demands they make an exception for him, this could drag out for a while. Cincinnati is likely to offer a massive signing bonus to try to convince Chase to sign while still holding to its policy. If he goes for it, that likely means he'd top the $38 million signing bonus CeeDee Lamb got from the Cowboys prior to the 2024 season.\n\nIt's just tough to imagine a structure in which the Bengals are OK with Chase getting the $100-million-plus guaranteed that Lamb and Jefferson got. For the sake of a prediction, though, let's say they blow Lamb's signing bonus out of the water with a number that \"virtually\" guarantees at least the first two years of the extension.\n\nPrediction: Five years, $180 million, $70 million guaranteed -- which would reset the receiver market in average annual value.\n\nMicah Parsons, Edge, Dallas Cowboys\n\nAge: 25 | 2024 stats: 12 sacks, 55 pressures, 43 tackles\n\nRemaining contract: One year, $24 million\n\nAs of now, Parsons is scheduled to play out 2025 on the fifth-year option from his rookie contract. His performance to date gives him a case to be the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL. At this point, that honor belongs to the 49ers' Nick Bosa, whose deal averages $34 million per year. However, players such as the Browns' Myles Garrett, the Raiders' Maxx Crosby and the Steelers' T.J. Watt are in line for potential extensions this offseason, too.\n\nWe know the Cowboys' history of waiting until the last minute to get these big deals done, and if they wait again, any or all of those three could sail past Bosa's number in the meantime. So I'll predict a deal here that imagines the top of this market moving up a few million annually before Parsons signs and still places him at the top of it once he does. After all, he has a 30.2% pass rush win rate over four seasons, by far No. 1 in the league over that time.\n\nParsons could tear up the final year of his contract and get a record-breaking new deal.\n\nPrediction: Five years, $180 million, $125 million guaranteed -- which would reset the edge rusher market in average annual value.\n\nDerek Stingley Jr., CB, Houston Texans\n\nAge: 23 | 2024 stats: 54 tackles, 5 INTs, 11 pass breakups\n\nRemaining contract: One year, $5.3 million plus 2026 fifth-year option\n\nPat Surtain II's four-year, $96 million deal with the Broncos is likely Stingley's target as the Texans are expected to make his extension a top offseason priority. They'll surely pick up the fifth-year option for 2026, which should cost around $17 million. But the strong likelihood is that they tear up the 2025 and 2026 years and replace them with a brand-new deal that pays Stingley like the top corner he has become.\n\nStingley has 11 career interceptions over three years, and he allowed 7.6 fewer receptions than expectation in 2024, per NFL Next Gen Stats (second among players with 400-plus coverage snaps). People I've talked to think Stingley could top Surtain's $24 million annual average and his $77.5 million in guarantees.\n\nPrediction: Four years, $104 million, $80 million guaranteed -- which would reset the cornerback market in average annual value.\n\nKyle Hamilton, S, Baltimore Ravens\n\nAge: 23 | 2024 stats: 107 tackles, 1 INT, six pass breakups\n\nRemaining contract: One year, $2.9 million plus 2026 fifth-year option\n\nAs a first-round pick in 2022, Hamilton has one year left on his rookie contract -- but the Ravens do hold a fifth-year option for 2026. That's likely to come in around $19 million, and Baltimore is sure to pick it up for a player who has been the best and most versatile on its defense. The question is whether the two sides can find common ground on an extension this offseason or whether that has to wait until next year.\n\nIf the Ravens wanted to play hardball, they could afford to wait. They'd have the ability to franchise Hamilton in 2027, and the franchise number for safeties is generally among the lowest in the league. But it's not like Baltimore to do that with a franchise cornerstone player like Hamilton, so I would expect the Ravens to discuss a new deal this offseason.\n\nTampa Bay's Antoine Winfield Jr. did a favor for the rest of the safety market with his extension last offseason, pushing the top end to around $21 million per year. Hamilton can and should expect to top Winfield whether his deal gets done this offseason or next.",

    "raw_text": "Shiffrin can't explain her Beijing Olympic performance, she's just doing the next right thing\n\n6. Allyson Felix, track\n\nKey accomplishments: 11-time Olympic medalist, seven-time Olympic gold medalist, record 18-time world championship medalist.\n\nFive Olympics. Eleven medals. Greatest U.S. runner in Olympic history. But a closer look at Felix's seven Olympic gold medals reveals another side to her success. In a sport defined by individual success, she might also be the greatest teammate in history. Felix won six of her seven Olympic gold medals as part of relays: two in the 4x100 meters and four in the 4x400. Her only individual gold came at the 2012 London Games in the 200 meters after taking silver in the previous two Olympics. That Felix experienced so much of her success while supporting her teammates comes as no surprise.\n\nIn the years since she retired from the sport, she has been an outspoken advocate for Black women's maternal health care and pay equity and protections for women athletes after childbirth. -- Roenigk\n\nHow motherhood empowered Allyson Felix to speak out\n\n7. Shaun White, snowboarding\n\nKey accomplishments: Three-time Olympic gold medalist in halfpipe (2006, 2010, 2018), 15-time X Games medalist.\n\nWhite stood at the top of the halfpipe at the 2018 Olympics and prepared to take his third and final run. He was in second place behind two-time silver medalist Ayumu Hirano, who had just landed back-to-back 1440s. White knew he needed to land the combo to best Hirano, but four months earlier, he'd crashed attempting to learn a cab double cork 1440 and suffered horrific injuries that required 62 stitches in his face and landed him in intensive care.\n\nWhite hadn't attempted the trick since, and he'd never landed back-to-back 14s. But in a move that embodied White's competitive nature and the spirit of action sports, he went for the combo, rode away clean and won his third Olympic gold in the event. \"Before my last run, I was like, 'OK, I can live with second,'\" White said that night. \"But I realized at that moment, I didn't have to.\" -- Roenigk\n\nAt his fifth Games, Shaun White is still snowboarding's greatest competitor\n\n8. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, track\n\nKey accomplishments: Eight-time Olympic medalist, three-time Olympic gold medalist, record five 100-meter world titles, oldest sprinter (35 in 2022) to win world title.\n\nOne day after Usain Bolt's win in the 100 meters at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Fraser-Pryce became the first woman from the Caribbean to win Olympic gold in the event. Four years later, she defended her title in the 100 (as did Bolt), further cementing Jamaica's reputation as a sprinting powerhouse. Only 5 feet tall and typically sporting rainbow locks, the \"Pocket Rocket'' has medaled in track and field's fastest race in the past four Games. In Paris, her fifth and final Olympics, Fraser-Pryce will line up once more with the goal of reclaiming her title as the fastest woman alive. -- Roenigk\n\nFraser-Pryce set for final run at Paris Olympics\n\n9. Kohei Uchimura, gymnastics\n\nKey accomplishments: Seven-time Olympic medalist, three-time Olympic gold medalist, six-time individual all-around world champion.\n\nOver an eight-year period from 2009 to 2016, Uchimura dominated men's gymnastics, going undefeated in all-around competition, winning back-to-back Olympic titles and leading the Japanese team to gold at the Rio Games. He retired from the sport in 2022 with a reputation for pairing extreme difficulty with unmatched consistency and flawless execution and is widely considered to be the GOAT of men's gymnastics.\n\nIn one of his most memorable all-around performances, Uchimura averaged higher than a 9.0 execution score on every apparatus to take the all-around title at the 2011 world championships in Tokyo, which were held seven months after an earthquake and tsunami devastated northeast Japan. -- Roenigk\n\nJapan's Kohei Uchimura claims sixth world gymnastics title\n\n10. Yuzuru Hanyu, figure skating\n\nKey accomplishments: Back-to-back Olympic gold medalist (2014, 2018), 7 World Championship medals (2 gold, 3 sliver and 2 bronze).\n\nAt his peak, Hanyu was not so much a figure skater but a rock star. Fans followed him around the world, armed with Winnie the Pooh toys. He was known to carry a Pooh tissue box to competitions and it became a thing. Hanyu wasn't known for the big jumps that have come to dominate figure skating in recent years, though he did attempt the quad axel, the hardest jump in the sport to date, at the 2022 Olympics. It is his artistry -- the breathless beauty of his skates -- that fans will remember forever. -- Elaine Teng\n\nWorld Fame 100: The crush of the crowd\n\n11. Tessa Virtue/Scott Moir, ice dancing\n\nKey accomplishments: Two-time Olympic gold medalists, first North Americans to win Olympic gold medal in ice dancing in 2010.\n\nChoosing the greatest moment for the most decorated Olympic figure skaters of all time is an impossible task, but it's hard to top winning their first Olympic gold in front of a home crowd at the 2010 Vancouver Games. Performing to the soaring strings of Mahler's Symphony No. 5, they dazzled with their twizzles, broke hearts with their artistry -- and put ice dance on the map. Virtue and Moir, who started skating together as children, sold their on-ice chemistry so effectively that many fans refused to believe they were not a real-life couple. (Sorry, they're now married to other people!) -- Elaine Teng\n\nCanada's Virtue, Moir become most decorated figure skaters in Olympic history\n\n12. Chloe Kim, snowboarding\n\nKey accomplishments: Two-time Olympic gold medalist, nine-time X Games medalist, youngest woman to win Olympic halfpipe gold, youngest winner of an X Games gold medal.\n\n\"My face kind of hurts right now, but that was so fun,\" Kim said in 2015 after winning her first X Games gold in snowboard halfpipe. Only 14, she was the youngest gold medalist in X Games history at the time, and she won on her third and final run after suffering a brutal wipeout earlier in the contest. She considered dropping out, and then decided she didn't want to wait another year to prove she was the best in the world. Nearly a decade later, she is a two-time Olympian, seven-time X Games gold medalist and in January, became the first woman to land a 1260 in competition. -- Alyssa Roenigk\n\nKim, 21, secures history with consecutive Olympic golds in snowboard halfpipe event\n\n13. Aliya Mustafina, gymnastics\n\nKey accomplishments: Seven-time Olympic medalist, two-time Olympic gold medalist, 11-time World Championship medalist.\n\nBefore Simone Biles made it seem easy to be successful across multiple Olympic cycles, there was Russia's Aliya Mustafina. She burst onto the scene as a 16-year-old to win the 2010 world all-around title, while leading her team to gold and earning three additional silver medals in event finals. She would go on to capture the Olympic gold on bars in both 2012 and 2016, with routines that are still lauded today for their variety of skills, easy swing and picture-perfect release moves. -- Amy Van Deusen\n\nMustafina wins bronze in all-around at 2016\n\n14. Apolo Ohno, speed skating\n\nKey accomplishments: Eight-time Olympic gold medalist, two-time Olympic gold medalist, 21 World Championship medals, 8 World Championship gold medals.\n\nThe most decorated U.S. Winter Olympian, Ohno won at least one medal in each of the Olympic short-track speed skating distances. In an unpredictable sport defined by collisions, crashes and controversy, Ohno found a way to get to the front of the pack year after year. At the 2006 Olympics, his second of three Games, Ohno led wire-to-wire to win the 500 meters in what he called the \"perfect race.\" -- Alyssa Roenigk\n\nOhno completes his Ironman journey\n\n15. Natalie Coughlin, swimming\n\nKey accomplishments: 12-time Olympic medalist, three-time Olympic gold medalist, tied for most Olympic events entered while medaling in all of them (12).\n\nCoughlin brought home six medals from the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the first American woman to do so in any sport. That year, she also became the first woman to win back-to-back Olympic gold in the 100-meter backstroke, her signature event. In 2002, the three-time Olympian became the first woman to swim the 100 back in under one minute. She broke that world record four more times before unofficially retiring from competitive swimming in 2016. -- Alyssa Roenigk\n\nBody Issue: Even scoliosis couldn't stop Olympic medalist Coughlin\n\n16. Lindsey Vonn, skiing\n\nKey accomplishments: Three-time Olympic medalist, Olympic gold medalist (downhill at Vancouver 2010), 82 World Cup victories (a record until February 2023).\n\nVonn's most memorable performances are a mix of dominance and doggedness. Like when she returned from a terrifying training crash at the Torino Olympics to finish eighth in the downhill. Or in Vancouver in 2010, when she sustained a badly bruised shin and thought she'd have to scratch her races -- then finished more than half a second ahead of the field to become the first American woman to win Olympic downhill gold. Vonn was one of the toughest, most tenacious athletes in alpine skiing. She retired at 34 with 82 World Cup wins, an Olympic gold medal and four overall World Cup titles to prove it. -- Alyssa Roenigk\n\nMy rocky, muddy, super-competitive 24 hours with Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn\n\n17. Ian Thorpe, swimming\n\nKey accomplishments: Nine-time Olympic medalist, five-time Olympic gold medalist, 11 World Championship titles, most-decorated Australian swimmer.\n\nA swimming prodigy from the get go, Thorpe became the youngest male individual gold medalist in history at age 15 when he won the 400-meter free at the 1998 worlds. The \"Thorpedo\" then took the 2000 Sydney Olympics by storm, winning five medals and becoming the most decorated Australian athlete at the Games. With the weight of his home country on his shoulders, Thorpe earned Australia's first gold of the Olympics with his victory in the 400 meters -- setting a new world record in the process. -- Amy Van Deusen\n\nESPN's top 25 Australian athletes of the 21st century\n\n18. Aly Raisman, gymnastics\n\nKey accomplishments: Six-time Olympic medalist, three-time Olympic gold medalist, member of 2011 and 2015 World Championship teams.\n\nWith six Olympic medals, Raisman is the second-most-decorated gymnast of this century behind Biles -- and was the captain of both the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams that won consecutive titles. She also stood out individually, with gold on floor in London and silver in Rio de Janeiro in the all-around and on floor. After the Rio Games, when a USA Gymnastics team doctor was sent to prison for felony criminal sexual conduct, Raisman became a voice for systemic changes in the sport and an activist for sexual abuse prevention. -- Amy Van Deusen\n\nRaisman: USA Gymnastics 'ignoring us, not creating change'\n\n19. Valentina Vezzali, fencing\n\nKey accomplishments: Nine-time Olympic medalist, six-time Olympic gold medalist, became first woman to win five fencing gold medals in 2008.\n\nVezzali is the most prolific fencer of all time, qualifying for five Olympics from 1996 and 2012 and winning at least one gold medal in each of those Games. She also holds a staggering 16 world titles. In 2013, she was elected to the Italian Parliament, telling CNN, \"From my point of view, if all the politicians were a bit more sporty, every country in the world would be much better off.\" She continued to compete until 2016, winning five more world medals after her election. -- Amy Van Deusen\n\nVezzali takes silver in last World Championship\n\n20. Lindsey Jacobellis, snowboard cross\n\nKey accomplishments: Three-time Olympic medalist, two-time Olympic gold medalist, five-time world champion, 10-time X Games champion.\n\nUntil 2022, Jacobellis' Olympic story was a cautionary tale: Don't celebrate before the finish. When she did just that in the snowboard cross final in Torino in 2006, in the sport's Olympic debut, the five-time world champion fell, scrambled to her feet and finished second. The heavy favorite to win every race she entered, Jacobellis won more races than any man or woman in her sport over the next 16 years, but failed to medal in her next three Olympics. Then, in her fifth Games in Beijing in 2022, she finally earned Olympic gold in snowboard cross and mixed doubles and became the first snowboarder to win multiple golds in one Games. -- Alyssa Roenigk\n\nJacobellis wins snowboardcross for first U.S. gold medal at Beijing Olympics\n\n21. Eliud Kipchoge, marathon\n\nKey accomplishments: Four-time Olympic medalist, two-time Olympic gold medalist, first person in recorded history to run a sub-two-hour marathon in 2019.\n\nKipchoge is widely regarded as the greatest marathoner of all time, and for good reason. He won gold in both the 2016 and 2020 Olympics and has a chance at a three-peat in Paris. But perhaps he is best known for breaking the two-hour marathon mark in 2019, at an event called the Ineos Challenge in Vienna, Austria. While it was not officially ratified by the IAAF because it was not an open road race, the barrier had previously been thought of as impossible, and he'll always be known as the first (albeit unofficially) to do it. -- Amy Van Deusen\n\nAre these Africa's 25 best athletes of the 21st century?\n\n22. Hilary Knight, hockey\n\nKey accomplishments: Four-time Olympic medalist, Olympic gold medalist in 2018, 138 points in 102 international games, 2023 IIHF Female Player of the Year.\n\nAfter silver-medal performances at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics, Knight led the U.S. to gold in Pyeongchang, scoring Team USA's first goal in a 3-2 win over Canada. At the 2023 women's world championship in Brampton, Canada, Knight became the first American hockey player to score a hat trick in an Olympic or world championship final and rallied the U.S. to a 5-3 win over Canada. That win was especially sweet after losing to Canada in the finals at the 2021 and 2022 worlds and the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. The leading goal scorer in women's hockey, Knight is currently the captain of Boston's professional women's hockey team. -- Alyssa Roenigk\n\nHilary Knight's impact on a generation of Team USA players\n\n23. Marit Bjorgen, cross country skiing\n\nKey accomplishments: 15-time Olympic medalist, eight-time Olympic gold medalist, five medals in 2018 (led all athletes), 114 World Cup individual wins.\n\nThe Norwegian cross country skier didn't have a particularly auspicious start to her Olympic career. In the 2002 Olympics, at age 21, Bjorgen earned silver in the 4x5-kilometer relay. Then she entered the 2006 Games as a four-time world champion, but struggled with illness and won just one more silver medal. She later told Olympics.com, \"I don't have many good memories, but I think it is the reason why I was able to have such a career.\"\n\nBjorgen came roaring back in 2010, winning five Olympic medals, the most of any athlete in Vancouver. She was equally impressive in the next two Games, and would go on to become the most decorated Winter Olympian in history, with 15 medals in all. -- Amy Van Deusen\n\nOlympic great Bjoergen retiring from cross-country skiing\n\n24. Brianne Jenner, hockey\n\nKey accomplishments: Three-time Olympic medalist, two-time Olympic gold medalist, women's hockey MVP in 2022 Olympics, 2 IIHF World Championships.\n\nJenner has been clutch for Team Canada over the past decade. The nine goals she scored during the 2022 Olympics tied the record for most in a women's tournament, as she helped lead Canada to a win over its long-time rival, the United States. In her first Olympic appearance in 2014, she scored the first goal in the gold-medal game, paving the way for another Canadian victory. And at the 2021 world championships, Jenner was key once again in the final, with both the first goal and a key assist in overtime, for Canada's first world title in nine years. -- Amy Van Deusen\n\nCanada top U.S., claims second straight Rivalry Series title\n\n25. Jason Kenny, cycling\n\nKey accomplishments: Nine-time Olympic medalist, seven-time Olympic gold medalist, 10-time World Championship medalist.\n\nKenny is the most decorated British Olympian in history with seven gold medals -- and perhaps his most dramatic win of all was his very last race. Kenny was the two-time defending sprint champion in Tokyo in 2021 but finished a disappointing eighth in that event in the early days of competition. The stage was set for keirin, his final race, but few considered him a favorite despite his status as defending champ in that event as well. When a small gap opened up during the final, Kenny went on the attack, surging ahead by almost a quarter lap and winning gold by 0.763 seconds, an enormous margin. (In 2016, he won gold in the same event by 0.040.) Kenny is married to Britain's greatest female Olympian, cycling star Laura Kenny, and the couple was awarded knighthood and damehood in 2022. -- Amy Van Deusen",

    "raw_text": "With 30 of 32 NFL teams eliminated from the playoffs, the 2025 offseason is quickly approaching. New coaching hires are just settling in and free agency is still six weeks away, but we're getting closer to a ton of player movement that will happen around the league via signings, cuts, trades and draft picks.\n\nWith that in mind, I took a look at the 2025 quarterback market. Who are the biggest movers and shakers of this offseason? What is the potential fallout from their decisions? Could a passer signing with one team drastically change things for multiple other franchises? And what are the QB-needy franchises' backup plans?\n\nUnlike in past offseasons, when myriad shoes could have been the first to drop, it seems clear the biggest domino is Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold. He approaches one of the most interesting free agency decisions of the past few years. Once his intentions are clear, the remaining teams looking for QB help will turn to secondary and tertiary options in a thin free agent market, a largely option-less trade pool and a rather poor draft class.\n\nTo examine all the quarterbacking dominoes for the next few months, I began with riddling out the Darnold dilemma and saw how things fell from there. Once I sorted out Darnold's options, I mapped out four potential scenarios for the rest of the QB landscape, with dominoes falling across the league based on where he might end up:\n\nJump to a section:\n\nDarnold's situation | Darnold's suitors\n\nThe other QBs potentially available\n\nDarnold to LV | Darnold to PIT\n\nDarnold to NYG | Darnold back to MIN\n\nThe Darnold dilemma: What is his market?\n\nIf every quarterback who could become available in this cycle does become available, the one most likely to command big free agent money is Darnold. He's still relatively young, having just turned 27 last summer. His 2024 season with the Vikings was also tremendous, as he threw for 4,319 yards with 35 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. A conservative estimate places him on a three-year deal worth about $30 million annually -- just below Baker Mayfield's yearly figure and just above that of Geno Smith.\n\nIt's easy to bristle at hearing that number, given the way Darnold ended the season. His two worst games came in a Week 18 loss to the Lions that kicked Minnesota to the NFC's 5-seed and then a wild-card loss to the Rams. It's all too easy to say that the most recent version of Darnold is the true version of Darnold, and that he should be paid accordingly.\n\nBut the league is absolutely desperate for quarterbacks -- both generally speaking and specifically in this moment. There just won't be many desirable free agent or trade options. And if there is a clear slam dunk, run-the-card-to-the-podium No. 1 pick at QB in this draft class, I haven't seen him yet. Yes, Darnold's two most recent games were worrisome wilts under bright lights. But of the quarterbacks who are about to become available, only one had a good overall season in 2024, and that player is Darnold.\n\nA three-year, $90 million contract would fall in line with deals signed recently by veteran free agents given an opportunity to hold down a starting job. In 2023, a 31-year-old Jimmy Garoppolo signed a three-year, $72.75 million deal with the Raiders to be their bridge starter, with midround rookie Aidan O'Connell behind him. Garoppolo's yearly contract value of $24.25 million represented 10.8% of the total salary cap the year it was signed. Remember: At the time, Garoppolo's value was far from its peak. He had been benched for second-year pro Trey Lance in San Francisco, started 10 games after Lance got hurt and played pretty well before his own injury paved the way for Brock Purdy. He was a player the 49ers were actively looking to replace.\n\nIn 2019, a 26-year-old Teddy Bridgewater had a similar season to Garoppolo's 2022. He stepped in for an injured Drew Brees in New Orleans, started exactly five games and played well enough to get a three-year, $63 million deal out of the Panthers. Again, that yearly contract value of $21 million represented about 10.6% of the 2020 total salary cap when it was signed.\n\nIf we call Darnold -- who stepped in for the injured J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota's No. 10 pick last April -- analogous to Bridgewater and Garoppolo, then a three-year deal at $30 million annually would represent 11.1% of the 2025 cap (assuming a $270 million cap). Now compare what Darnold did in his season before free agency to what Bridgewater and Garoppolo did in theirs. Statistically, Darnold was about as successful a passer as Bridgewater and Garoppolo were before they hit the market.\n\nStill, $30 million for three years is a conservative estimate. Bridgewater was a late-first-round pick, and Garoppolo was a second-rounder. NFL teams weren't sprinting to invest in them in 2014, when they were both drafted. Do not underestimate how tethered teams remain to their initial draft grades. The fact that Darnold was the third pick in 2018 -- and continues to throw the ball with the sort of spectacular arm talent only ex-No. 3 picks can -- makes him a more interesting commodity on the open market. Garoppolo was also older and far more experienced when he hit the market; his ceiling was well discovered at that point. Bridgewater had a substantial injury history. But Darnold still has some mystery (and upside) left to his game.\n\nSo a bigger contract is within reason. Derek Carr signed a four-year, $150 million deal with the Saints at 31 years old -- after a 2022 season in which he was benched for poor play with the Raiders. Last offseason, a 35-year-old Kirk Cousins signed a four-year, $180 million deal coming off an Achilles injury. Both quarterbacks were good for far longer than Darnold has been, but both were also much older than Darnold. And it isn't hard to argue that Darnold's next four years will be equal to that of Carr or Cousins when they signed their respective deals.\n\nIt is important to note the structure of these deals, too. Cousins' contract was functionally a two-year, $100 million deal with nearly no guaranteed money in the final two years. And before the Saints started restructuring his contract, Carr had only $60 million guaranteed at signing. Like Cousins' deal, Carr's contract had almost no guaranteed money after the first two years. While the idea of signing Darnold to a four-year, $140 million deal seems preposterous, I wouldn't be surprised to see those figures at all. Functionally that ends up playing out more like a two-year, $70 million contract with a couple of team options attached behind it if Darnold plays well.\n\nWith this range of Darnold's free agent market in mind -- a three-, maybe four-year deal worth $30 million to $40 million per year -- the next question becomes which team will give it to him.\n\nDarnold's potential suitors\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\n\nWith $73.2 million in projected cap space for 2025, the Raiders will have the cash on hand to sign Darnold to a front-loaded deal -- perhaps one reported as a four-year contract but really built more like a two-year trial. Las Vegas just tried its hand at the free agent quarterback market, having signed Gardner Minshew to a two-year, $25 million deal last offseason. That was a swing and a miss, but the decision-makers from that team -- Antonio Pierce and Tom Telesco -- have been replaced by new brass. John Spytek is in as general manager, and Pete Carroll is the new head coach.\n\nCarroll participated in the reclamation of perceived bust Geno Smith in Seattle. Of course, he also developed midround rookie Russell Wilson into a franchise quarterback -- but remember, the Seahawks had signed Matt Flynn in free agency that year, too. Spytek comes from Tampa Bay, where Darnold's fellow 2018 draftee Baker Mayfield launched a successful career recovery and signed a three-year, $100 million extension (that was functionally a one-year deal with a couple of team options).\n\nThe Raiders seem like the right sort of team to kick the tires on Darnold's 2024 season as a sign of things to come, trusting in Carroll to help the young and easily flustered passer learn how to play in postseason conditions.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nWhile I would usually dismiss the idea of Mike Tomlin signing a free agent quarterback to a significant contract, desperate times might elicit desperate measures. Once again, Pittsburgh is out of range to draft a franchise passer in April, having made the playoffs and precluded itself from a top-10 pick. Will the Steelers look to execute a big trade up in this draft class? I highly doubt it. What about hanging tight at No. 21 and selecting someone the rest of the league passed on? Well, that didn't work well with Kenny Pickett the last time around.\n\nPittsburgh has two free agent signal-callers scheduled to leave the building (Russell Wilson and Justin Fields), so Pittsburgh's participation in the Darnold market will be dictated by whether they have an open job. Steelers owner and president Art Rooney II said Monday, \"My preference would be to sign one of them,\" referring to Wilson and Fields. But I wouldn't rule anything out for Pittsburgh anymore.\n\nNew York Giants\n\nWhile New York fans will permit nothing but Shedeur Sanders jersey swaps for the next two months, it must be said: The Giants pick No. 3 in the draft, not first. If the Titans (No. 1) or Browns (No. 2) -- both of whom have tenable quarterback situations at best -- decide to take the prospect(s) the Giants prefer, New York will be painted into a corner. By most estimations, this is charitably a two-QB race at the top of the class between Colorado's Sanders and Miami's Cam Ward, and even then, I'm not convinced either is a shoo-in for a top-five pick.\n\nSo the Giants must have some viable free agent starter before the draft comes around in April. That isn't Drew Lock, who is a free agent this offseason. Will coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen -- who have been informed by ownership that their jobs are in jeopardy -- place their eggs in a Jarrett Stidham basket? Throw their lot in with Andy Dalton? Desperation should drive the Giants to the Darnold market. Darnold plus a highly drafted rookie passer would give Daboll and Schoen the most routes to a job-saving performance in 2025.\n\nMinnesota Vikings\n\nThe final (but also the first) team that must be considered significant in the Darnold sweepstakes is the home team. The Vikings are clearly gung-ho about McCarthy. They drafted him with the 10th pick to become their franchise quarterback. He suffered a torn meniscus in training camp, which is dreadful luck, but they're enthusiastic about his recovery and prognosis. They believe he can be their guy.\n\nBut smart teams don't let quarterbacks who just performed well over a 14-win season leave the building easily. General manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah, who comes from an analytics background, primed coach Kevin O'Connell on the very possibility of Darnold playing his way into a multiyear contract before the 2024 season even began.\n\n\"I always ask Kevin before the season starts, 'Hey, what information would you need to kind of change your mind?'\" Adofo-Mensah said recently. \"And to say it beforehand so that you're not kind of whipped around with what potentially could happen. And we had those conversations beforehand. We thought there was a chance Sam Darnold could play at a high level.\"\n\nIf the Vikings had gotten the season they just got from Darnold -- 14 wins, a few clutch performances and a collapse under postseason pressure -- instead out of McCarthy, they'd be over the moon right now with their rookie quarterback. That's the sort of information that can change a staff's mind: Minnesota can be in contention for the No. 1 seed in the conference with this guy at quarterback.\n\nAdofo-Mensah, who clearly always believes in having dart throws at QB (see the midseason signing of Daniel Jones), could choose to enter 2025 with all of his chips on the McCarthy bet. That means McCarthy will fully recover from his meniscus injury and also play well at the NFL level -- something that is never certain with any rookie. But Adofo-Mensah could also enter the 2025 season with a second dice roll at the position, re-signing Darnold on a multiyear deal.\n\nIf Darnold's market indeed comes in near $40 million per year, the Vikings will likely get priced out as they address other positions. But if Darnold wants to stay in the O'Connell offense and Minnesota can get him at a lower figure, don't be surprised to see it happen. Plus, Darnold's contract would become a valuable trade asset if McCarthy is great -- and a valuable escape hatch if McCarthy is shaky. This approach is far more preferable than the franchise tag, which would hit the Vikings for $41 million against the 2025 cap and be far more difficult to trade.\n\nWhich QB move comes next?\n\nDarnold is the cream of this free agency crop in both name and relative value. Besides Darnold, the only upcoming free agents who started multiple games this season are Wilson, Fields, Jones, Lock, Dalton, Mason Rudolph, Jacoby Brissett and Cooper Rush. Not exactly a group you're running to pay. There are three veteran names who might join the (semi) open market, though.\n\nThe first is Kirk Cousins, who was ousted from the Falcons' starting job in December. The 36-year-old clearly never returned to form following an Achilles injury. Will another year removed from the injury bring him back to fighting shape? The Falcons reportedly plan to release Cousins before the start of the 2025 league year to avoid a $10 million roster bonus that would kick in for 2026. That would make Cousins' contract a failed two-year, $90 million endeavor instead of a two-year, $100 million one -- a small consolation. Someone will sign Cousins -- perhaps behind a young passer -- on the off chance his body bounces back after another offseason.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of aging passers with bad Achilles, Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers is in an interesting contractual quagmire. The old Jets regime structured Rodgers' deal to push as much money into future years as possible. As such, Rodgers had a signing bonus of $35 million (paid out in 2023 but prorated against the cap from 2023 to 2027), an additional option bonus of $35 million (prorated from 2024 to 2028) and a third option bonus for another $35 million (prorated from 2025 to 2029).\n\nThat last option bonus is due if and only if Rodgers is back for the 2025 season. While Rodgers' 2025 cap hit might look small at $23.5 million, a whopping $63 million in dead cap money accelerates onto the 2026 balance sheet when Rodgers' deal expires after 2025. It would cost the Jets over $90 million to keep Rodgers next season, whereas cutting him before the 2025 season would cost them only $49 million overall.\n\nIt's very unlikely Rodgers remains a Jet on his current deal. The contract would have to be totally reimagined. Otherwise, Rodgers would need to be released and/or traded -- at which point he would become a 43-year-old free agent who did not play well at his last stop despite the entire team catering to his needs.\n\nThe final potential addition to the 2025 free agent pool is Saints quarterback Derek Carr. Because the Saints do not yet have a head coach, it's not easy to figure out the approach for Carr, who represents an astonishing $51.5 million cap hit in the 2025 season -- fourth highest in the league. If the Saints desperately need cap relief, they can cut (or trade) Carr and designate him a post-June 1 transaction, borrowing from the 2026 cap to create 2025 relief.\n\nThis is unlikely, as the Saints will probably stop borrowing to detox their cap and begin recreating a financially healthy team. (They are projected to have minus-$70.6 million in cap space in 2025, per Roster Management System.) But it is not impossible and bears mention here.\n\nNow let's map out some dominoes for all of these QBs based on what happens with Darnold.\n\nScenario No. 1: If Darnold goes to the Raiders\n\n... then Cousins goes to the Steelers ...\n\nDon't sleep on the Steelers as a good landing spot for Cousins, who can follow the Arthur Smith/Ryan Tannehill plan of never, ever leaving the pocket. Cousins would be better than Wilson (I think?) and good for receiver George Pickens, who is a much better middle-of-the-field receiver than most people think.\n\n... and Rodgers goes to the Titans ...\n\nI like Rodgers to the Titans. Coach Brian Callahan, who cut his teeth with Peyton Manning before coaching Joe Burrow, seems like the sort of guy to fall for Rodgers' mental ability, even if the physical ability no longer matches it. Rodgers could be the 1A to Will Levis' 1B entering camp as Tennessee looks to trade the top overall selection. (To be clear, I do not think this would work well for the Titans.)\n\n... and Wilson goes to the Jets ...\n\nNew Jets general manager Darren Mougey was with the Broncos when they executed the big trade for Wilson. Either Mougey is completely out on Wilson after that stint in Denver and this isn't happening, or he still harbors some belief in him -- meaning Wilson could really be an option. We'll learn more as the offseason rumor mill starts up, but this is a connection to watch as the Jets search for stopgap solutions while they recover from Rodgers' cap devastation.\n\n... and the Browns draft Ward.\n\nGiven what I've seen from the top two passers in the draft class, I very much expect Ward to be drafted before Sanders. The Browns will draft a quarterback as their first legitimate escape attempt from the Deshaun Watson contract -- an escape that might be easier now because of the non-football nature of Watson's Achilles reinjury.\n\nScenario No. 2: If Darnold goes to the Steelers\n\n... then Rodgers and Wilson both go to the Raiders ...\n\nI'm not totally sure I buy the idea that Wilson and Pete Carroll would welcome a reunion in Las Vegas, but it would be great for content, so I'll allow it here. Wilson was not enough of a bridge QB for the Steelers this season, and given his below-average caliber of play, he should not be enough for the Raiders either. With Rodgers and Wilson on one-year deals, though, the likelihood for functional quarterbacking doubles (and the potential for preposterous locker room hijinks increases by a factor of 10).\n\n... and Fields goes to the Giants ...\n\nFields' free agency won't be eventful, though he's still a young player and I'd be kicking the tires on him. Is there a Darnold-esque ascension in him as he gets another year removed from Chicago? The Giants, who loved the QB run game with Jones, seem like a good spot for Fields to spend some time as QB2. And hey, if that rookie the Giants draft isn't ready to start the season ... you never know!\n\n... and the Titans actually stay at No. 1 and draft a quarterback.\n\nWhile new Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi made it clear his team is willing to trade the top selection or pass on a quarterback outright, it remains true that the Titans very much need a quarterback. Teams that have the first pick and need a QB end up drafting one nine out of 10 times. Again, to me that player is Ward. (But this class isn't nearly good enough to lock any passer into the top pick in late January.)\n\nScenario No. 3: If Darnold goes to the Giants\n\n... then Rodgers goes to the Colts ...\n\nIf there's a sleeper team to become suddenly desperate for immediate quarterback help, it's the Colts. General manager Chris Ballard and coach Shane Steichen held on to their jobs, but without a big season in 2025, they could find themselves in hot water again. Rodgers is the splashiest name on the market and completely different stylistically from incumbent Anthony Richardson, which seems to be what the Colts want in their QB2. I'd bet good money that Steichen can design a solid offense around Rodgers -- if Rodgers is willing to fit into the system.\n\n... and the Jets trade up to the No. 1 pick ...\n\nIf the Titans are really willing to do business with the top selection, then their best suitors are likely the Jets (No. 7) and Raiders (No. 6). The Steelers (No. 21) are too far back and would have to trade up into the low teens before they could even start calling the Titans.\n\nOf those two teams, I'd expect the Jets to be more aggressive than the Raiders, because Las Vegas has far more cap space to solve its problems in free agency than the Jets. A trade from No. 7 to No. 1 might go pretty cheap in a draft like this, too. Could the Jets include one of their young stars (Breece Hall, I'm looking at you) like the Panthers did when they sent DJ Moore to the Bears to move from No. 9 to No. 1 a few years ago?\n\n... and the Steelers re-sign both Wilson and Fields ...\n\nTell me you can't see this coming. Pittsburgh, clearly in need of some team-building magic, just calmly runs it back with the same options it had in 2024. Maybe the Steelers play Fields a little more. Maybe they add a wide receiver. Who knows? They'll start the season 9-1, finish 12-5 and get ousted in the wild-card round again.\n\n... and Dalton goes to the Titans.\n\nDoes Brian Callahan pursue a reunion with Dalton? The two spent a season together in Cincinnati before Burrow was drafted, and while that season was far from Dalton's best, I imagine Callahan appreciates the way Dalton sees the game. In the worlds in which the Titans trade out of the top pick, they are likely passing on the rookie quarterback class altogether. So Dalton would compete in a camp battle with Levis while the Titans tread water and wait for the 2026 quarterback class to offer salvation.\n\nScenario No. 4: If Darnold stays with the Vikings\n\n... then the Steelers trade for Carr ...\n\nWhile the most likely outcome is that Darnold gets a big deal from someone else in free agency, I remain far less confident than public perception that he gets out of Minnesota. And if he stays, things could get wonky, fast. In Darnold's absence, I could see the trade market getting hot for a player like Carr, the next-best option for two to three years of acceptable play. The Steelers and coach Mike Tomlin need that plug-and-play fix at quarterback to finally find some postseason wins before seats start to get too hot. Could they work with the Saints to get New Orleans some cap relief in return for Carr's services? I think it's doable.\n\n... and Levis goes to the Raiders ...\n\nIf the Raiders elect to take a patient, multiyear approach to their rebuild, then I'd imagine Spytek would take a Mayfield-ian gamble at the position by finding a quarterback who was drafted with an early-round pick but never developed, just to see if his coaching staff can get more out of him. Levis doesn't entirely fit the bill, as he was taken 32 picks later than Mayfield and is much younger now than Mayfield was when the Bucs signed him. But Levis is a physical competitor whose development is stuck in neutral.\n\nIf the Titans intend to draft a quarterback with the top pick, why not try to snag an early Day 3 selection for Levis while his value is still decent?\n\n... and Jameis Winston goes to the Jets ...\n\nIf and when the Jets move on from Rodgers, their quarterback options are pretty bare. They are not in a great position to draft one and lack enough cap space to sign one. A good stopgap is Winston, the haphazard but always entertaining veteran who most recently was losing shootouts for the Browns. Winston was in New Orleans in 2020 with Aaron Glenn -- now the Jets' coach -- so there's some familiarity there.\n\n... and Cousins goes to the Browns ...\n\nSpeaking of familiarity, if Cousins ends up the odd man out in a rather active trade market, then I could see him running to Cleveland to reunite with Kevin Stefanski, who coached him for two seasons in Minnesota. Watson is unlikely to be ready for the 2025 season, and the Browns obviously do not want to play him even if he is physically ready. Cousins could hold the job while the Browns recover financially, play in an offense familiar to him and maybe look good enough to get one final payday somewhere.\n\n... and Jones goes to the Colts\n\nThe biggest domino of them all! Jones, currently squirreled away on the Vikings' roster as QB3, is presumed to be the Vikings' new veteran bridge when Darnold leaves in free agency. But what if Darnold stays?\n\nJones would hit the market and likely have decent interest. I like him best for the Colts, and the Colts best for him, as he matches well with Richardson. They have very similar play styles, and Jones actually had a season of NFL success (2022) when he was a run-heavy quarterback who also dinked and dunked in a spread, run-pass option passing game. Jones can help Richardson develop and even take his job, which is exactly what you want in a veteran QB2 behind a shaky, young QB1.",

    "raw_text": "Premier League clubs spent almost \u00a32 billion during the summer transfer window, and there were some really interesting deals. But January 2024 marked the league's lowest total in winter spending in three years (\u00a396.2m), so what does 2025 hold?\n\nHere are grades for all the major confirmed transfers in the men's game, with each listed by date and then by highest fee.\n\nAll fees are reported unless confirmed with an asterisk.\n\nJan. 31\n\nMario Hermoso\n\nLoan\n\nRoma: B\n\nBayer Leverkusen: A\n\nHermoso was one of last summer's prized free agents, so to see him move on from Roma so quickly will surprise some, but clearly things haven't worked out so far (the Giallorossi being on their third manager of the season already may have something to do with that).\n\nLeverkusen found themselves in need of some defensive depth following Jean\u00fcel Belocian's ACL tear earlier this month, so Xabi Alonso will likely be delighted to add such an experienced, hardened -- and in the right circumstances, talented -- player to the fold. He's a great fit to cover the left-centre-back role in the back three, as he played plenty of that during his time at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\n\nJan. 30\n\nXavi Simons\n\n\u20ac50m ($52.1m)\n\nPSG: A\n\nRB Leipzig: C+\n\nAt face value, this looks like a fine deal for RB Leipzig: \u20ac50m to sign an excellent young player who has spent the last 18 months with them on loan feels like a fair risk/reward balance. But there's a couple of extra reported details that intrigue: First, add-ons of \u20ac30m could take this up to a whopping \u20ac80m; and second, he's only signed a contract until 2027. That's not normal for such a transfer, where such a big fee is involved. It suggests that Simons may well be on the move again in the not-too-distant future-especially if Leipzig fail to make the Champions League for 2025-26.\n\nPSG, meanwhile, receive a huge sum for a player they've barely ever considered for the first team.\n\nJan. 29\n\nEmiliano Buend\u00eda\n\nLoan\n\nAston Villa: B\n\nBayer Leverkusen: B\n\nBuend\u00eda is yet to start a Premier League game since tearing his ACL roughly 18 months ago. He's been given a few starts here and there in cup games, but he's largely been reduced to a substitute's role, meaning he can't gain any fitness or rhythm.\n\nPerhaps a change of scenery is just what he needs, and the Bundesliga looks a good fit for him: At he's best he's a talented, creative player, but regardless of form or fitness, he's always the hardest worker on the pitch, happy to press high and willing to track back. Leverkusen will have a \u20ac20m option to sign him permanently if they want.\n\nJan. 27\n\nRenato Veiga\n\nLoan\n\nChelsea: A-\n\nJuventus: B\n\nJuventus have been sailing very close to the wind on centre-back numbers these last few months; with Danilo gone and Bremer out for the season injured, they're using the same partnership - Federico Gatti and Pierre Kalulu - in basically every game they play. Depth was clearly needed, and while it's taken them most of the month to sort it, a loan for Veiga at least gives them the insurance they were looking for (and he can deputise at left-back too).\n\nChelsea are receiving a \u20ac5m loan fee for a player they don't need, so that will no doubt help them regarding Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).\n\nJan. 25\n\nAntony\n\nLoan\n\nManchester United: A\n\nReal Betis: B+\n\nThere's shades of the Randal Kolo Muani deal here, with Manchester United realising the same thing PSG did: The only way to stand any chance of one day recouping a decent fee for an unwanted player is to get him out on loan and playing first, in order to rebuild his confidence. But it's quite a turnaround from his \u20ac95m arrival.\n\nThere are plenty of games to go around at Real Betis, including UEFA Conference League knockouts, so Antony stands a good chance of playing in southern Spain. He also feels like the exact type of mercurial, inconsistent forward the club are known for signing, so there's every chance the fans take to him.\n\nJan. 24\n\nKYLE WALKER\n\nLoan\n\nManchester City: A\n\nAC Milan: D\n\nFor many transfers, it's about how much you paid and how much you recouped; but in Walker's case, it's about ensuring a player whose incredible 7\u00bd years of service is rewarded with a manner of exit of his choosing.\n\nWalker's form this season has dropped off a cliff and both parties have recognised that in parting ways. Perhaps a change of scenery rejuvenates him, but this seems like an odd deal from Milan's perspective -- especially when you consider they're reportedly covering his entire \u20ac200,000-per-week wage packet and have a \u20ac5m option to sign him permanently.\n\nMICHAEL KAYODE\n\nLoan\n\nFiorentina: C+\n\nBrentford: B+\n\nRight-back has proven a problem position for Brentford this season; three different players have played there in the absence of the injured Aaron Hickey, two of them being giant centre-backs, as manager Thomas Frank searches for answers.\n\nKayode is an intriguing solution. He's extremely energetic and positive, always playing forward and always looking for an overlap. There's work to be done on the technical side of his game, but he should suit a reactive team like Brentford. Securing a loan with a \u20ac16m option to sign permanently is great work from the Bees, but somewhat questionable from Fiorentina's end -- even if he has been demoted to a squad role of late.\n\nJan. 23\n\nOMAR MARMOUSH\n\n\u20ac70m (\u00a359m; $71.9m)\n\nEintracht Frankfurt: A+\n\nManchester City: B\n\nNo one has had a more transformative 18 months than Marmoush, who joined Eintracht Frankfurt on a free transfer in 2023, but has now made a blockbuster move to the reigning English champions.\n\nMarmoush scored and assisted at will last season and has continued in the same vein this term, attracting interest from most of Europe, so Eintracht set a huge asking price. City, who are desperate for confidence and creativity, coughed up \u20ac70m, plus another \u20ac5m-\u20ac10m in add-ons, which is no small sum for a player who spent years in the wilderness before only recently hitting his stride.\n\nWhile the signing does carry some risk, it's clear why City took the plunge: He's fast, strong, creative and an expert set-piece taker. He might be the shot in the arm they need.\n\nRANDAL KOLO MUANI\n\nLoan\n\nParis Saint-Germain: A\n\nJuventus: A\n\nThings went wrong for Kolo Muani at PSG as he fell out of favour with manager Luis Enrique, despite the fact he's an established France international and the club spent \u20ac80m to sign him from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2023. But just because he doesn't appear to suit Luis Enrique doesn't change the fact that, when fit and firing, he's an excellent striker. He just needs a bit of rhythm.\n\nKolo Muani could well prove a great, opportunistic pickup for a Juventus side that struggles to turn draws into wins. Meanwhile, from PSG's perspective, this straight loan is a chance for Kolo Muani to regain some market value ahead of a potential permanent (and more expensive) exit in the summer.\n\nJan. 21\n\nVITOR REIS\n\n\u20ac35m (\u00a329.5m; $36m)\n\nPalmeiras: A-\n\nManchester City: A\n\nAccording to ESPN's Tim Vickery, Vitor Reis is a classy defender with huge potential. Strong defensively, assured on the ball and comfortable in a back three or four, he has all the ingredients to become a top centre-back; he just needs to fill out physically.\n\nA \u20ac35m fee represents a Brazilian league record received for a defender, vastly eclipsing the \u20ac20m PSG paid to sign Lucas Beraldo in 2024. With that, Palmeiras should be happy enough -- although they did want him to stick around for the Club World Cup this summer, so losing him six months early might sting.\n\nJan. 20\n\nABDUKODIR KHUSANOV\n\n\u20ac40m (\u00a333.6m; $40.8m)\n\nLens: B\n\nManchester City: A-\n\nCity are in dire need of defensive reinforcements, so signing one of the best young centre-backs in the world is certainly a good start on that front. Khusanov is extremely fast and reads defensive situations well so, despite being just 20 years of age, could positively impact this team from the get-go. He'll need to improve his passing, but that can come with time.\n\nLens could eventually receive up to \u20ac48m for this deal, which is a lot for a French club not named PSG. But they know deep down he could have gone for even more had they been able to hang onto him for another few months.\n\nJan. 17\n\nKHVICHA KVARATSKHELIA\n\n\u20ac60m (\u00a350.7m, $61m)\n\nNapoli: D\n\nParis Saint-Germain: B+\n\nThis is undoubtedly the January transfer window's top storyline so far: Kvaratskhelia, a hero in Naples for his part in the 2023 title win, effectively walking out on the club halfway through another title tilt and joining PSG.\n\nIt's a disaster for Napoli, who have lost a sensational, talismanic player for what is a fairly modest fee. Manager Antonio Conte has effectively revealed that in not letting him go last summer, it has cost the club money.\n\nPSG will be delighted to get an exceptional winger on the (relative) cheap, but it must be pointed out that this was hardly a position of concern for the club given they already have Bradley Barcola, an in-form Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9, and several others on their squad.\n\nJan. 15\n\nJADEN PHILOGENE\n\n\u00a320m ($24.7m)\n\nAston Villa: A\n\nIpswich Town: B\n\nIpswich wanted to sign Philogene in the summer but were beaten to the deal by Villa, who reacquired him from Hull City with big expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations haven't been met (aside from one superb performance in the Champions League against Bayern Munich) and he has moved on just six months later.\n\nFor Villa, banking \u00a320m for a player who very quickly lost his way at the Premier League level will undoubtedly be very satisfactory. That loss of form and confidence means Ipswich are taking a slight gamble, but he'd no doubt be a star for them in the Championship next season if the worst were to happen.\n\nJan. 14\n\nDONYELL MALEN\n\n\u20ac25m (\u00a321m; $25.5m)\n\nBorussia Dortmund: B+\n\nAston Villa: C+\n\nMalen has felt destined to depart Dortmund for some time now; for one reason or another, he has never quite fit there, with injuries playing a part in that, as well as the general disruption at the club. BVB will be happy enough with the fee received.\n\nVilla is a slightly surprising destination, but perhaps Unai Emery sees him as a replacement for Moussa Diaby -- someone who can play wide or behind the striker and score goals -- who they were forced to move on last summer to meet UEFA's Squad Cost Ratio rules. Malen will need to up his game to prove worth the outlay of \u20ac25m, which could rise to \u20ac30m with add-ons.\n\nJan. 9\n\nEMMANUEL AGBADOU\n\n\u20ac18m (\u00a314.9m; $18.8m)\n\nStade de Reims: B+\n\nWolves: B+\n\nCentre backs come in vastly different forms, and it's safe to say Agbadou is of the more active type. He racks up tackles, interceptions, duels won and clearances willingly, showcasing good strength and an ability to do a bit of everything. Stylistically, think similar to Chelsea's Axel Disasi.\n\nWolves are badly in need of central defensive help, so Agbadou looks like a plug-and-play signing who immediately lifts them. The fact that he has spent 2\u00bd years in Ligue 1 is a bonus there, as players tend to translate very effectively from France to England. Both teams should come away happy enough with the fee exchanged.\n\nJan. 7\n\nJULIO SOLER\n\n\u00a36.6m ($8.2m)\n\nLan\u00fas: B+\n\nBournemouth: A\n\nIt should come as no surprise to see Bournemouth hit the market for a left back, given their current incumbent, Milos Kerkez, is so highly thought of by the world's top teams. This looks a lot like the Cherries are planning ahead, which is undoubtedly smart.\n\nLan\u00fas have a reputation for developing stellar fullback talent, and Soler will now be managed by a very good former fullback in Andoni Iraola. The 19-year-old's game is packed with energy and aggression, and he's already on the cusp of the Argentina national team. This feels like a match made in heaven. The initial fee looks a little low for such an established prospect, but the deal could rise to \u00a311.5m if targets are hit -- that would be a Lan\u00fas club-record fee.\n\nJan. 5\n\nANTONIN KINSKY\n\n\u20ac14.5m (\u00a312.5m; $14.9m)\n\nSlavia Prague: A\n\nSpurs: B+\n\nGuglielmo Vicario's injury this season made clear how short Spurs had left themselves in the goalkeeper department. As a backup, Fraser Forster ticks the veteran box, but doesn't actually suit Ange Postecoglou's ball-playing system.\n\nThat makes 21-year-old Kinsky one for the future, but also one for the now, too. He has been praised for his long distribution and ability to use both feet, which will lead to some early opportunities to stake his claim. His first game in the Carabao Cup vs. Liverpool worked out pretty well.\n\nJan. 1\n\nYANG MIN-HYEOK\n\n\u00a33.3m ($4.1m)\n\nGangwon FC: B\n\nSpurs: A\n\nTottenham beat a host of competition to sign Yang, the freshly crowned Korean League Young Player of the Year. He joins the club that South Korean compatriot and idol Son Heung-Min has made so famous in his nation -- something that perhaps made Spurs the most likely destination all along.\n\nThe fee isn't an awful lot for a Premier League side to stake on potential, so from Tottenham's perspective, this is low-risk, high-reward business. His 12 goals and six assists last season suggest there's plenty of upside. It may seem to be a paltry fee for Gangwon, but the perception in South Korea is that this is a strong return.\n\nDIEGO G\u00d3MEZ\n\n\u00a311m ($13.8m)\n\nInter Miami: C+\n\nBrighton: B+\n\nG\u00f3mez has moved from Paraguay to MLS to the Premier League in the space of just 18 months, with Brighton happy to strike early for the potential he has quickly shown. There has always been a rough rule of thumb in football that any player Lionel Messi clearly enjoys playing with is likely a quality one -- so G\u00f3mez's on-pitch connection with the Argentina legend at Inter Miami speaks volumes.\n\nMiami have described the fee received as \"among the most expensive outbound transfers in MLS history,\" but when compared to previous deals, it's tough to shake the feeling that it's a little on the low side.",

    "raw_text": "The payoff was worth it, right? When the UEFA Champions League's first-ever league phase began this season -- with an expanded field, no groups and just one giant, 36-team table -- it was a little bit difficult to work our way into the tournament. It was hard to tell what early wins and losses actually meant and the consequences of a slump felt pretty low, even for Europe's powerhouse clubs.\n\nBut then Paris Saint-Germain entered the penultimate matchday outside the bubble, needing a pair of good results to actually qualify for the knockout rounds. Then Manchester City waited until the last 30 minutes to actually secure a spot during an absolutely chaotic, 64-goal, 18-matches-all-at-once final matchday.\n\nIn the end, almost nothing was decided until the final day, and of Wednesday's 18 matches, only about six had no real stakes.\n\nHow decisive was that final day? Of the top 16 teams in the final league phase table, 12 won on Wednesday, and one of only two losses was suffered by a Liverpool team that had already clinched a spot in the top two. The team that finished in sixth place (Bayer Leverkusen) finished with only six more points than the team that finished 26th (Stuttgart). This thing was an absolute what-if machine, and it almost snagged a couple of the sport's heavyweights.\n\nThe new format drew plenty of skepticism early on, and that's somewhat justifiable -- if only because at first glance it just seemed like a way for UEFA to coax more matches and more money out of its signature club event (and because, at first, two of the four extra bids were intended to go to big, successful clubs that hadn't otherwise qualified for the Champions League). But once the extra bids were made a bit more democratic -- in the end, the final two bids went to the highest-placed teams in the countries that had the most success in UEFA tournaments the year before -- there was a lot to like here.\n\nTeams were exposed to more opponents and got a bit more time to find their footing. Dinamo Zagreb nearly advanced despite losing 9-2 to Bayern Munich on Matchday 1. (In fact, if they'd only lost 6-2, they'd have made it.) Celtic fans got to celebrate three home wins as the tournament's more middleweight clubs actually got to duke it out with other middleweights. Only two of 36 teams went winless, and only two had clinched a top-eight spot heading into the final matchday.\n\nThere were more fun moments for home crowds, and there was more limbo at the end. It's hard to ask for much more than that, right?\n\nSo, as we prepare for Friday's round-of-24 draw, let's take a quick look back at Matchday 8, the best players of the league phase overall and the teams most well-positioned for a title run.\n\nMost impactful games of Matchday 8\n\nThere weren't many genuinely meaningless matches in the final matchday, but a few still stood out from the pack.\n\nMANCHESTER CITY 3, CLUB BRUGGE 1\n\nOn Nov. 6, after a 4-1 loss to Sporting CP, Manchester City's odds of advancing to the knockout rounds, per Opta's power ratings, were still 99.4%. Three weeks later, after an equally disappointing 3-3 draw with Feyenoord (they led 3-0 in the 75th minute), their odds held at 97.2%. Hell, after a 2-0 loss to Juventus in December, they were still at 90.8%.\n\nThey had so many opportunities to right the ship in peaceful fashion but refused, collapsing late against PSG last week and finding themselves down 1-0 at halftime against Club Brugge on Wednesday. Then, in the 62nd minute, with an unfortunate own goal off of Joel Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, City finally saved themselves.\n\nSavinho put the match away in the 77th minute, and City were officially safe.\n\nAfter each of City's first two goals, Brugge took control of the pitch for a moment, and City looked wobbly. This is, after all, still a flawed squad that, in its most important match of the season, started a center back at left back (Josko Gvardiol, who has put in a lot of time on the left this season) and a one-time attacking midfielder at right back (Matheus Nunes, who is not a right back).\n\nIt worked well enough to fend off Belgium's second-best club at home, but Pep Guardiola has only a couple of weeks to work a few new signings into the mix and establish a level well enough to test either Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in what will be the headline pairing of the knockout playoff round.\n\nVFB STUTTGART 1, PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN 4\n\nThe biggest do-or-die match of the day became one-sided in a hurry. PSG, who trailed Manchester City 2-0 last week before ripping off four second-half goals, scored another three in the first 35 minutes at VfB Stuttgart. Speedy Bradley Barcola scored once, then assisted the first of three Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 goals, and PSG, 25th heading into Matchday 7, rolled all the way up to 15th.\n\nThis was obviously a pretty disappointing way for Stuttgart's campaign to end. Sebastian Hoeness' squad was all over the map in this competition, fighting well but losing 3-1 to Real Madrid in Matchday 1, stumbling onto their back foot for much of a 1-1 draw with Sparta Prague and getting absolutely stomped 5-1 at Red Star Belgrade in Matchday 5, but showing well against Real Madrid in an eventual loss at the Bernabeu and scoring a memorable 1-0 win at Juventus. They would have advanced with a draw, but that possibility vanished within about 20 minutes.\n\nDINAMO ZAGREB 2, AC MILAN 1\n\nSPORTING CP 1, BOLOGNA 1\n\nAC Milan entered the final matchday sitting sixth in the giant Champions League table, while Dinamo Zagreb were 26th. A lovely early counterattacking display produced a goal for Dinamo's 21-year old Martin Baturina, and when Christian Pulisic tied the match for 10-man Milan early in the second half, Dinamo quickly responded via Marko Pjaca.\n\nThe loss was enough to drop Milan all the way to 13th in the table -- they'll face either Feyenoord or Juventus in the knockout playoff round -- and it sure seemed like it would be enough to push Dinamo into the knockouts as well. All they needed was for an inspired (and eliminated) Bologna to hold onto a late 1-0 lead in Lisbon against Sporting. Alas, 19-year-old Conrad Harder's 77th minute tap-in salvaged a draw and allowed Sporting to steal Dinamo's spot.\n\nLILLE 6, FEYENOORD 1\n\nASTON VILLA 4, CELTIC 2\n\nThe battle for the final spots in the top eight were absolutely fierce. Here are the teams that finished sixth through 12th.\n\nBorussia Dortmund, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich all won comfortably and were positioning themselves to take advantage of a slip from either Lille or Aston Villa. (Bayer Leverkusen was comfortably favored against Sparta Prague and won comfortably.) But after watching a 2-0 lead disappear in three minutes thanks to a pair of Adam Idah goals for Celtic, Villa responded with methodical domination. Celtic managed only two shot attempts in the final 50 minutes, while Villa attempted 13 second-half shots, went ahead in the 60th minute thanks to Ollie Watkins, and then put the match away with Morgan Rogers' third goal of the evening.\n\nThere was no slip-up in Birmingham, and there was really no stumble in Lille. After Lille and Feyenoord traded goals in the opening 15 minutes, Lille laid the hammer down with a combination of brilliant finishes and Feyenoord miscues. Four different Lille players scored, including Jonathan David, and they got a pair of own goals from Gernot Trauner as well.\n\nThe final score was rather misleading -- Lille attempted 14 shots worth 1.2 xG, and pulling six goals from that was highly improbable. But they have ruthlessly exploited opponents' mistakes this whole tournament. They earned their bye, and they landed in what might be the friendliest portion of the draw.\n\nBARCELONA 2, ATALANTA 2\n\nThis one was almost impactful. A Barca win would have clinched the top spot in the table -- it wouldn't have benefited them in any way as far as the draw is concerned, but would have felt like a pretty symbolic victory after recent seasons' struggles in the Champions League. Meanwhile, an Atalanta win would have salvaged a top-eight spot for a team with absolute top-eight upside.\n\nIn the end, we got one of the only draws of the day.\n\nBarca seized control twice, Atalanta responded twice with vigor, and Barca couldn't find a late winner despite creating some decent chances. Fun match.\n\nBest XI of the league phase\n\nWith new January registrations on the way following the end of the winter transfer window, some of the teams in the knockout playoff round could look pretty different moving forward (hello, Manchester City), but let's quickly commemorate the best players of this strange league phase journey.\n\nBayern and PSG were each a bit disappointing, but both had multiple starters on the league phase XI. Liverpool was comfortably the best team, but really only had one player for the list. (Oh, and because history belongs to the victors, we'll list only players from teams that made the knockout playoff round.)\n\nGK: EMI MARTINEZ, ASTON VILLA. The ever-quirky 32-year-old was second among goalkeepers with 4.4 goals prevented (calculated by comparing the postshot xG value of opponents' shots on goal to actual goals allowed), and he was one of the better ball progressors among Champions League goalkeepers too, leading the field with 58 progressive carries and ranking second with 380 overall touches.\n\nBackup: Lucas Chevalier, Lille\n\nRB: ACHRAF HAKIMI, PSG. He's just the best right back in the world, and he proves it pretty frequently. There were more successful right backs than left backs in this competition, and it didn't matter -- name the statistical category, and Hakimi probably ranked first in it: assists (3), chances created (21), shots on goal (8), pass attempts (578) and completions (510), touches (836), progressive carries (91), progressive passes (57), even successful 1v1s in the box (4). He's basically a full-fledged right winger in possession ... but he also ranked second among right backs in defensive interventions (91). A fire starter and fire fighter.\n\nBackup: Marcos Llorente, Atletico Madrid\n\nCB: OLIVIER BOSCAGLI, PSV EINDHOVEN; STEFAN DE VRIJ, INTER. Considering PSV allowed at least two goals in four of their eight matches, we're not really putting Boscagli on here for his defensive work. We're putting him on here because defenders are also the first prong of the attack, and no center back was better in that role: He created seven chances (first among CBs), attempted seven shots (third), and completed 111 progressive passes (third) and 96 progressive carries (fourth). The plus-1.4 expected point value added (xPVA) from his on-ball actions was first as well.\n\nDe Vrij? He's on here because of his defensive work -- more specifically, his team's defensive work. Inter allowed one goal -- one goal! -- in eight matches, easily leading the league phase in both that category and xG allowed per shot. Goalkeeper Yann Sommer did excellent work between the posts, but Inter were also collectively brilliant at preventing good opportunities.\n\n(Red denotes no goal, green denotes goal)\n\nEven when opponents worked the ball into the box, there was almost always a body between the ball and the goal, and xG figures (represented by the size of the circles above) remained low. Each of the trio of De Vrij, Alessandro Bastoni and Benjamin Pavard were sound, but we'll give De Vrij the nod because he also ranked first on the team in defensive interventions and second in combined progressive carries and passes (behind only Bastoni).\n\nBackups: Brendan Chardonnet, Brest; Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, Benfica\n\nLB: NUNO MENDES, PSG. There haven't been many genuine standout leftbacks in this competition -- even stalwarts like Bayern's Alphonso Davies and AC Milan's Theo Hern\u00e1ndez didn't really light the world afire. But Mendes was steady and strong on both ends, scoring once and ranking fifth among left backs with 82 defensive interventions, and no left back in the world progresses the ball better: He was first in progressive carries (79 -- only Davies also had more than 62) and first in progressive passes (158 -- only Davies and City's Josko Gvardiol also had more than 100).\n\nBackups: Alphonso Davies, Bayern Munich\n\nDM: JOSHUA KIMMICH, BAYERN MUNICH. His future at Bayern appears uncertain at the moment, but the 29-year-old remains one hell of a metronome. No one in the league phase had the ball at his feet more than Kimmich, who led the competition in touches (895), pass attempts (748) and pass completions (689), and he was also fifth in progressive passes (109) and, for good measure, second in ball recoveries (48). Pitching in three assists (seventh) from 22 chances created (third) was just showing off.\n\nBackup: Youri Tielemans, Aston Villa\n\nHas the new Champions League format been a success?\n\nGab Marcotti and Julien Laurens debate whether the new Champions League format has improved the competition.\n\nCM: MALIK TILLMAN, PSV EINDHOVEN. The 22-year-old American has been one of the breakout stars of the competition. He combined three goals -- including two during a mad, late (and vital) comeback against Shakhtar Donetsk -- with two assists from 21 chances created, and he would have also been on a Try Stuff XI list. He won 64% of his one-on-ones, while drawing five fouls in the attacking third. After a slow start, PSV advanced with four wins from their past five matches, and Tillman was a major catalyst in that.\n\nBackup: Davide Zappacosta, Atalanta (more of a left midfielder, but still)\n\nAM: JAMAL MUSIALA, BAYERN MUNICH. As I was putting this list together, I started to think American Christian Pulisic (AC Milan) might also make the team alongside Tillman. Then I compared his stats to Musiala. Both had five combined goals and assists -- Pulisic had four and one respectively, while Musiala had two and three -- but like Hakimi, Musiala is almost too statistically dominant to have any competition at this position. He matched Pulisic's goal creation prowess while playing a far greater role in buildup play: He had 66 progressive carries to Pulisic's 45, 16 successful one-on-ones to Pulisic's seven and even 50 defensive interventions to Pulisic's 24. Musiala is just incredible. And he hasn't turned 22 yet.\n\nBackup: Christian Pulisic, AC Milan\n\nRW: MOHAMED SALAH, LIVERPOOL. Liverpool's league phase story was one of controlled brilliance. They were clearly the best team in this phase, outscoring opponents 15-2 with seven wins in their first seven matches before giving backups a run on Wednesday (and damn near taking a point against PSV while doing so). Fourteen different Reds contributed at least one goal or assist over eight matches, but no one does controlled brilliance like Salah, who, even while sitting during the last match and playing only 602 of 720 minutes, led all Champions League right wingers with seven combined goals and assists. Among all positions, only Atalanta's Charles De Ketelaere topped Salah's four assists, and he could have done even more had his teammates not been contributing so dang much, too!\n\nBackup: Michael Olise, Bayern Munich\n\nCF: SERHOU GUIRASSY, BORUSSIA DORTMUND. So much of being a great striker boils down to (A) finding good opportunities and (B) putting those opportunities in the net. We overvalue (B) as compared to (A) at times, but both are vitally important, and no one has done a better job of both (A) and (B) than Guirassy thus far. Including four penalty attempts, he created (or had created for him) eight shots worth more than 0.3 xG during BVB's run to 10th place. He put seven of them in the net, including all four pens, and of his 23 total shot attempts in the league phase, he put 15 of them on goal and six in the net.\n\nBarca's Robert Lewandowski was equally lethal in this department, but I'm giving the edge to Guirassy both because he also contributed a bit more in the ball progression department and because he didn't have Raphinha and Yamal on either side of him.\n\nBackup: Robert Lewandowski, Barcelona\n\nLeft winger: Raphinha, Barcelona. He honestly might be the MVP of the competition thus far. Raphinha led the league phase with 12 combined goals and assists; he had eight of the former (including a hat trick in a huge 4-1 win over Bayern) and four of the latter (including two against Atalanta on Wednesday). He was the best left winger of the league phase -- despite pretty stiff competition from Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Florian Wirtz -- and against Young Boys, he switched to more of a central role and came up with a goal and assist from there.\n\nBar\u00e7a's overall form has teetered a bit in all competitions as the patented Hansi Flick high defensive line has grown a bit more easy to exploit, but even if a game turns into an all-attack track meet, Barca can still win quite a few more matches in this competition thanks to the exploits of Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski.\n\nBackup: Vinicius Junior, Real Madrid or Florian Wirtz, Bayer Leverkusen\n\nSo who wins this thing?\n\nThis year's knockout rounds are an interesting combination of American-style seeding with European-style random draws. In a strictly-seeded 24-team, for instance, the No. 1 seed would play the winner of No. 16 vs. No. 17 in the round of 16, while No. 8 plays the winner of No. 9 vs. No. 24.\n\nTo blur the picture a bit, soccer-style, Nos. 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, et cetera, are interchangeable. The bracket will clear itself up a bit after Friday's knockout playoff round draw, but at this exact moment, all we know is the batches of potential opponents.\n\nRegardless, this is already a potentially fascinating draw. We know that Manchester City will play either Bayern or Real Madrid in the first round -- put another way, one of Real Madrid or Bayern will play City while the other plays Celtic -- and at most, only two of those three royal teams will advance to the round of 16. Meanwhile, we also know that two teams from a fun batch of Atalanta, Aston Villa, Borussia Dortmund, Club Brugge, Lille and Sporting CP will make the quarterfinals.\n\nObviously, City vs. Bayern/Real Madrid will be the headliner of the first knockout round, but there are some potentially fun intraleague matchups such as Milan vs. Juventus, Feyenoord vs. PSV and PSG vs. either Monaco or Brest on the board.\n\nPSG's recent knockout round history suggests it would be rather apt if they were upset early on, but a win and a round-of-16 matchup against Liverpool or (especially) Barcelona would be dynamite as well. And I'm going to lap up nearly any combination of matchups from the Lille/Villa sections of the draw: the home crowds will be absolutely rocking for any of Villa, BVB, Lille, Sporting or Atalanta, especially with their clubs facing major opportunities for a big run.\n\nThat's enough chit chat, though. Who's actually going to win this thing?\n\nAccording to ESPN BET, we basically have five primary favorites: Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal and whoever doesn't draw Manchester City in the knockout playoff round.\n\nThe odds for Real Madrid and Bayern should shift a bit after Friday's draw tells us which will face City, though Real Madrid's current torrid form should make them a solid favorite regardless. If they avoid an upset, PSG loom as a potential bracket landmine for either Liverpool or Barca, too, though we won't know which until the draw before the round of 16.\n\nThe main story at this stage is, even with Liverpool's incredible current form, no one is really a favorite just yet. But just for grins, here's how I predict things would play out if I were given complete control over who draws who in the bracket.\n\nKNOCKOUT PLAYOFF ROUND PICKS\n\n\u2022 Benfica over Brest\n\n\u2022 Borussia Dortmund over Club Brugge\n\n\u2022 Bayern Munich over Celtic\n\n\u2022 PSV Eindhoven over Feyenoord\n\n\u2022 AC Milan over Juventus\n\n\u2022 Real Madrid over Manchester City\n\n\u2022 Atalanta over Sporting CP\n\n\u2022 PSG over Monaco\n\nROUND OF 16 PICKS\n\n\u2022 Liverpool over Benfica\n\n\u2022 Aston Villa over Borussia Dortmund\n\n\u2022 Bayer Leverkusen over Bayern Munich\n\n\u2022 Inter Milan over PSV Eindhoven\n\n\u2022 Arsenal over AC Milan\n\n\u2022 Real Madrid over Atletico Madrid\n\n\u2022 Atalanta over Lille\n\n\u2022 PSG over Barcelona\n\nQUARTERFINAL PICKS\n\n\u2022 Liverpool over Aston Villa\n\n\u2022 Bayer Leverkusen over Inter Milan\n\n\u2022 Real Madrid over Arsenal\n\n\u2022 Atalanta over PSG\n\nSEMIFINAL PICKS\n\n\u2022 Liverpool over Bayer Leverkusen\n\n\u2022 Real Madrid over Atalanta\n\nFINAL PICK\n\n\u2022 Liverpool over Real Madrid\n\nBask in these perfect predictions until Friday's draw messes up all the matchups.",

    "raw_text": "There are four games on tap tonight, with six of the eight teams having been in the playoffs last season.\n\nThings are a bit different so far this campaign, particularly for the Philadelphia 76ers. They come into this game in 11th place in the Eastern Conference, but with the same number of losses as Chicago and only 1.5 games behind the Bulls for the last play-in spot. They'll be facing a Los Angeles Lakers team that's right in the thick of the Western Conference playoffs race as the fifth seed, a game ahead of the sixth-place LA Clippers and a game behind the fourth-place Denver Nuggets.\n\nHouston comes in on a high note, a day after overcoming a double-digit fourth quarter deficit to defeat the defending champion Boston Celtics. They go to Atlanta to face a Hawks team also on the second half of a back-to-back, after losing a competitive game to Minnesota despite missing both Trae Young and Jalen Johnson.\n\nThe other two games also feature one team on the second half of a double dip, with the Milwauee Bucks returning to Damian Lillard's old stomping grounds to face the Portland Trail Blazers. Meanwhile, Utah lost to the Bucks last night, and heads further west to challenge the struggling Golden State Warriors.\n\nTuesday's Stream Team\n\nToumani Camara, Portland Trail Blazers (available in 77.7 of ESPN leagues): Camara can be up and down, but for the most part has played strong since the end of 2024. Since Dec. 30, he has averaged 2.4 combined steals and blocks and 1.6 3-pointers over 14 games. In his last outing, he dropped 24 points with nine boards and four assists.\n\nOnyeka Okongwu, Atlanta Hawks (52.7% available): Okongwu has started five straight games for the Hawks, and in his last eight has averaged a solid 15.4 PPG and 11.6 RPG. He has also averaged 1.0 blocks, 1.5 steals and 1.5 3-pointers during that stretch.\n\nKeyonte George, Utah Jazz (62.9% available): George has come off the bench in his last two games, but is still playing 30+ minutes and producing starting-caliber numbers. In eight games since the calendar turned to 2025, George has averaged a strong 17.4 PPG and 6.1 APG with almost three 3-pointers and a steal in 32 MPG.\n\nDre's bets for Tuesday\n\nAmen Thompson (HOU) to record 35+ total points, rebounds and assists (+105) In the wake of his monster effort on Monday, in which he dropped 33 points including the game-winning shot, Thompson said \"I feel like Kobe\". Thompson is playing the best basketball of his young career, and is contributing across the board. He has started his last 10 games, averaging 19.2 PPG, 11.6 RPG and 4.4 APG during that stretch. In those 10 games, he has produced 35+ PRA seven times, including in each of his last three games.\n\nAnthony Davis (LAL) over 26.5 points (-125) Davis is on the second half of a back-to-back, but he is also right in the middle of a heater. He dropped a season-high 42 points (as well as a season-high 23 rebounds) on Monday, and has averaged 32.8 PPG in his last four outings. He'll be facing a 76ers squad missing Joel Embiid for the second time this season; in the first meeting he scored 31 points.\n\nDamian Lillard (MIL) over 27.5 points (-120) Lillard is in the midst of one of his most consistent scoring sprees since joining the Bucks. He has scored at least 22 points in 11 straight games, averaging 27.3 PPG during that span, but his scoring is accelerating. He has put up 29.0 PPG in his last six games, and 31.0 PPG in his last three. He will be facing his former squad, the Trail Blazers, which struggle on defense and are allowing the fourth-most fantasy points to opposing point guards.\n\nJazz (+10.5 points) over Warriors (-105) The Warriors have lost 20 of their last 30 games. During that 30-game span, they have won only two games by more than 10 points. The Jazz have one of the worst records and scoring margins in the NBA, but on average they are outscored by only 7.3 PPG. And the Warriors, for most of the season, have been a below average team that would be expected to outscore the Jazz by even less than those 7.3 points.\n\nProjections and Injury Reports\n\nBasketball Power Index by ESPN Analytics.

    "raw_text": "The NBA has five games on the schedule Thursday night, highlighted by a battle between the No. 2 and 3 seeds in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Houston Rockets have been arguably the hottest team in the NBA since the calendar turned to 2025, and are winners of 11 of their past 14 games. The Memphis Grizzlies, meanwhile, just had a six-game winning streak snapped in their last outing and host Houston after winning four straight games at home.\n\nLet's get into the fantasy options to stream and bets to make on Thursday.\n\nThursday's Stream Team\n\nToumani Camara, Portland Trail Blazers (Available in 76.4% of ESPN leagues)\n\nCamara missed a game last week due to illness but has been stellar since his return. He has averaged 14.8 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 1.8 3PG and 1.0 SPG in 35.8 MPG in his past four games.\n\nZach Edey, Memphis Grizzlies (55.1% available)\n\nEdey is having one of the best weeks of his rookie campaign. He has almost averaged a double-double with excellent defensive numbers in his past three games: 13.7 PPG, 9.7 RPG, 3.0 BPG and 1.0 SPG in 23.7 MPG.\n\nJaden McDaniels, Minnesota Timberwolves (57.6% available)\n\nMcDaniels has been filling the stat sheet across the board in his past 10 outings: 14.1 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 1.9 SPG, 1.5 3PG and 1.3 BPG in 35.2 MPG. Those are all plus stats, and particularly valuable in category leagues where defensive stats and 3-pointers are scarcer commodities.\n\nDre's bets for Thursday\n\nRockets +5.5 over Grizzlies (-115)\n\nThis is the fourth meeting of the season between these two teams. The Rockets have won all three of the previous matchups, including both games earlier this month. The Grizzlies are playing well, winners of six of their past seven, but the Rockets are on a four-game winning streak of their own and match up well against the Grizzlies. Keep an eye on the availability of Alperen Sengun (calf), but whether he plays or not, I'll take the Rockets with the points.\n\nDe'Andre Hunter over 17.5 points (-115)\n\nHunter has averaged 19.1 PPG on the season, and after a slower start to 2025 he is back up to 18.2 PPG in his past five outings. Atlanta needs more from Hunter with Jalen Johnson done for the season, and he has played well against Cleveland this season. Hunter has averaged 24.5 points on 57.1 FG% in two matchups vs. the Cavaliers.\n\nToumani Camara over 10.5 points (-115)\n\nCamara has been steadily improving over the course of the season, particularly since the end of 2024 and into the new year. He has scored at least 11 points in 11 of his past 15 games going back to Dec. 30, including in three of his past four outings this week, and has averaged 14.6 PPG during that span.\n\nProjections and injury reports\n\nBasketball Power Index by ESPN Analytics.

    "raw_text": "The offseason has arrived for 30 NFL teams while the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs are preparing for Super Bowl LIX, so we're taking a look at what lies ahead over the next two months, with free agency set to begin on March 12.\n\nWe asked our NFL Nation reporters to pick the one free agent from the team they cover whose contract status will shape that franchise's offseason the most. The list includes a couple of quarterbacks returning to free agency, veteran receivers who figure to be in high demand and one of the league's best offensive linemen.\n\nWhich players could define the offseason? We'll start in the AFC East:\n\nJump to:\n\nARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN\n\nCLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND\n\nJAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN\n\nNE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF\n\nSEA | TB | TEN | WSH\n\nAFC EAST\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\nCB Rasul Douglas\n\nThe Bills acquired Douglas at the trade deadline in 2023, and since then, he has been a consistent starter for the defense opposite outside cornerback Christian Benford. Douglas will be 30 when the 2025 season begins, and the Bills will have to decide whether they want to get younger at the position or keep the veteran, who has built a great relationship with Benford. If the Bills do move on, they will have to invest (including through the draft) because there isn't significant depth at the position. -- Alaina Getzenberg\n\nMiami Dolphins\n\nS Jevon Holland\n\nHolland and the Dolphins attempted to negotiate an extension last offseason but were unable to reach an agreement. Holland's production dipped in 2024; he failed to record an interception and had a career-low 62 tackles. Part of this could be attributed to playing for three coordinators in as many seasons. But if Holland is looking for top-of-the-market money, it probably won't come from Miami, which let two other homegrown players leave in free agency last offseason. If they are unable to re-sign Holland, the Dolphins would face an urgent need at safety, where they were already thin last season. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nCB/S Jonathan Jones\n\nJones, 31, has been with the Patriots since 2016, when he entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent. He is one of the last players remaining on the roster who won multiple Super Bowl championships; the Patriots don't have a long list of free agents (DL Deatrich Wise Jr., QB Jacoby Brissett, etc.), and Jones' status as a pillar from a culture standpoint makes him arguably the headliner of the group. Jones fits in best at slot or safety, but injuries piled up on him in 2024, and a new regime under coach Mike Vrabel might not value him the same. -- Mike Reiss\n\nNew York Jets\n\nCB D.J. Reed\n\nReed, coming off three solid seasons as the Jets' CB2, says he's looking forward to exploring the market. The Jets don't have an obvious replacement on the roster. But Reed's asking price probably will exceed what they can afford to pay. He made $33 million over three years on his last contract. At only 28 years old, he's looking to top that. -- Rich Cimini\n\nOrlvosky: Jets should draft a QB, even if Rodgers returns\n\nDan Orlovsky joins \"The Pat McAfee Show\" to discuss how Aaron Glenn and the Jets should move forward with Aaron Rodgers.\n\nAFC NORTH\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nOT Ronnie Stanley\n\nThere's no question the Ravens would like to retain Stanley, who had a solid bounce-back season in blocking on Lamar Jackson's blind side. He ranked 12th in pass block win rate among tackles (92.5%), played in every game for the first time in his nine-year career and continued to be a respected leader. The issue will be cost for Stanley, who is expected to be one of the top left tackles available in free agency. Baltimore, which is projected to have limited salary cap space, probably won't overspend on an offensive lineman who will turn 31 around the start of free agency. -- Jamison Hensley\n\nCincinnati Bengals\n\nWR Tee Higgins\n\nHiggins' franchise tag has expired, making him a free agent this offseason. Both publicly and privately, quarterback Joe Burrow has made it clear he does not want Higgins to leave the building. The Bengals could put the franchise tag on Higgins for a second straight year and extend the timeframe for the two sides to work something out. If the price is right, a long-term deal could be in the best interest for both Higgins and a Bengals team trying to max out the current window. -- Ben Baby\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nRB Nick Chubb\n\nIn Chubb's return from the knee injury he sustained in September 2023, he didn't resemble his previous Pro Bowl form and posted a career low in yards per carry (3.3). He should become more explosive with another year removed from the injury, but he turns 30 in December, and general manager Andrew Berry was noncommittal on Chubb's return. Chubb had said he wanted to finish his career in Cleveland. He could return on an incentive-laden deal that allows the Browns to search for additional options to bolster the running game. -- Daniel Oyefusi\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nQBs Russell Wilson and Justin Fields\n\nWith neither Wilson nor Fields under contract when the new league year tolls, the Steelers' biggest free agent decision is two-fold. It's unlikely the Steelers will bring back both quarterbacks for another year, leaving the team to choose between a 36-year-old Wilson, who went 6-5 as the starter with 16 passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns and five interceptions, or Fields, who turns 26 in March and posted a 4-2 record with five passing touchdowns, five rushing touchdowns and an interception. They could also opt to move on from both and take a swing on another free agent or draft a rookie signal-caller. -- Brooke Pryor\n\nShould Russell Wilson, Justin Fields or someone else start at QB for Steelers?\n\nStephen A. Smith and Shannon Sharpe discuss the Steelers options at quarterback for 2025.\n\nAFC SOUTH\n\nHouston Texans\n\nWR Stefon Diggs\n\nDiggs sustained an ACL tear in his right knee this season, and the Texans sorely missed him as quarterback C.J. Stroud was left with only one consistent target in Nico Collins. Receiver Tank Dell is likely to miss most of 2025 after sustaining a dislocated left kneecap and torn ACL on Dec. 21. The Texans will have two voids at receiver if they don't re-sign Diggs. Will the Texans try to get him on a team-friendly deal or find a different option elsewhere? -- DJ Bien-Aime\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nDE Dayo Odeyingbo\n\nThe Colts didn't put enough consistent pressure on quarterbacks this season, but Odeyingbo led Indianapolis in pressures with a career-best 33. His sack numbers declined from eight in 2023 to three this season, but it's hard to imagine a proven 25-year-old pass rusher not landing a deal worth eight figures per year. The Colts have to decide whether promising rookie Laiatu Latu and the return of Samson Ebukam from injury (9.5 sacks in 2023) is enough to let Odeyingbo walk in free agency. -- Stephen Holder\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n\nS Andre Cisco\n\nOf the 11 players who are scheduled to become unrestricted free agents, only two -- Cisco and RG Brandon Scherff -- are starters. Cisco had eight interceptions over the past three years but had issues in coverage. The secondary as a whole gave up eight pass plays of 50 or more yards in 2024. Whomever new coach Liam Coen appoints as defensive coordinator will have input on whether to try to re-sign Cisco, but it's hard to see the Jaguars being willing to spend much to bring him back. -- Michael DiRocco\n\nTennessee Titans\n\nWR Nick Westbrook-Ikhine\n\nWestbrook-Ikhine went from an afterthought on the roster who didn't have any targets through the first four games of the season to leading the team with nine touchdown receptions. The receiver group is thin aside from Calvin Ridley, so bringing back one of the most reliable targets from last season is a move the front office should make. Westbrook-Ikhine's contract probably won't break the bank, and the Titans have the cap space. -- Turron Davenport\n\nAFC WEST\n\nDenver Broncos\n\nQB Zach Wilson\n\nThe Broncos have defensive starters such as DT D.J. Jones and LB Cody Barton, as well as RB Javonte Williams, who are scheduled to be unrestricted free agents. But the intriguing question is with backup QBs Wilson and Jarett Stidham. Everyone on the Broncos has said Wilson and Stidham were key in Bo Nix's development during a rookie season in which he threw 29 touchdown passes. Both Wilson and Stidham are free agents and, depending on the market, might be able to do better elsewhere. Wilson, a former No. 2 pick, is just 25 years old with 33 career starts and could be a good option to keep as backup QB. -- Jeff Legwold\n\nKansas City Chiefs\n\nG Trey Smith\n\nThe Chiefs would like to retain Smith, but it's far more likely that he will leave. In tackle Jawaan Taylor, guard Joe Thuney and center Creed Humphrey, the Chiefs already have invested in their offensive line. They have groomed Mike Caliendo, once an undrafted rookie free agent, and Hunter Nourzad, a fifth-round pick in 2024, and would attempt to have one of them ready to become a starter if Smith departs. -- Adam Teicher\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\n\nMLB Robert Spillane\n\nSpillane signed a two-year, $7 million contract in 2023 to become a full-time starter for the first time in his career. He became not only the green dot at middle linebacker but also the spiritual leader of the defense. So he is in line for a raise. Consider: 306 of his 497 career tackles came in the past two seasons, as did 5.5 of his 8.5 career sacks and five of his six career interceptions. Spillane, who will be entering his eighth season, did not sit out a game in his two years with the Raiders. But will new Raiders coach Pete Carrol and GM John Spytek hold the same feelings? -- Paul Gutierrez\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\n\nOLB Khalil Mack\n\nMack is perhaps the Chargers' most respected player and earned his ninth Pro Bowl selection this season. In the Chargers' playoff loss to the Texans, Mack led the team with two sacks. Still, he will be 34 next season, and he had six sacks this season, tied for the second lowest in his career. Regardless, Chargers GM Joe Hortiz and coach Jim Harbaugh said re-signing Mack is a top priority for the team. -- Kris Rhim\n\nNFC EAST\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nCB Jourdan Lewis\n\nSince Micah Parsons is under contract with his fifth-year option, he doesn't count -- but the biggest decision is on the defensive side of the ball. Lewis is more than just a slot cornerback, though he is one of the better slot corners in the NFL. He can defend receivers. He can set the edge. He can blitz off the edge. He has a nose for the ball. But he is also a core part of the locker room and a big reason why things remained stable despite all of the injuries. It might cost the Cowboys a little more than they would want to spend, but Lewis' value goes beyond the field. -- Todd Archer\n\nBrian Schottenheimer confident Cowboys can win a Super Bowl quickly\n\nNew Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer tells Todd Archer that the team can compete for a Super Bowl right away.\n\nNew York Giants\n\nWR Darius Slayton\n\nIt's easy to say Slayton and the Giants should move on, but the Giants need more receiving threats. Who replaces him if he walks? Slayton is going to be considered one of the top free agent wide receivers, and the team's Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee is a good influence on the younger receivers. One can only imagine what he can produce in a better offense, with four 700-yard seasons under his belt and 15 yards per reception throughout his career. -- Jordan Raanan\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n\nLB Zack Baun\n\nThe Eagles thought they were getting a rotational edge rusher and special teams contributor when they signed Baun to a one-year deal last offseason. Instead, he developed into one of the best off-ball linebackers in football, earning first-team All-Pro honors after posting 151 tackles, 3.5 sacks and 5 forced fumbles for the league's No. 1 defense. Philadelphia doesn't typically invest a ton in the linebacker position, but with Nakobe Dean facing a long recovery from a torn patellar tendon, there should be even more urgency to sign its breakout star to a long-term deal. -- Tim McManus\n\nWashington Commanders\n\nLB Bobby Wagner\n\nWagner signed a one-year deal to join Washington last offseason, but there were questions about what he had left entering his 13th season. It turns out, he had quite a bit. Wagner recorded his 13th consecutive 100-plus-tackle season and earned second-team All-Pro honors (the 11th time he has been either first or second team). In addition, his leadership set a major tone in the locker room and would be hard for the Commanders to replace. -- John Keim\n\nNFC NORTH\n\nChicago Bears\n\nWR Keenan Allen\n\nThe Bears were wise to acquire Allen as a trusted option for Caleb Williams' rookie season; he had a team-high seven touchdowns and ranked second in receiving yards (744), targets (121) and catches (70). That's strong production for any receiver, but bringing the 32-year-old back would need to come at a discount. New Bears coach Ben Johnson might have plans to go younger and add more speed at the position. It could mean Allen would need to find a different team with which to finish his career. -- Courtney Cronin\n\nDetroit Lions\n\nG Kevin Zeitler\n\nZeitler signed a one-year deal with the Lions last offseason after a Pro Bowl year in Baltimore, and he didn't miss a beat. He started 16 games on an offensive line that served a pivotal role in the Lions' franchise-best 15-win season. Although GM Brad Holmes was impressed with his production, at 34 years old, it's hard to tell whether Detroit is willing to offer him anything other than another short-term deal. \"A player of that age, you've just got to have conversations with him,\" Holmes said. \"We had conversations on exit day and then we'll just continue to have dialogue and just kind of see where it goes.\" -- Eric Woodyard\n\nOrlovsky trusts Dan Campbell's offense after new OC hire\n\nDan Orlovsky joins \"The Pat McAfee Show\" to react to news of John Morton joining the Lions as their new offensive coordinator.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nC Josh Myers\n\nThe Packers haven't always paid interior offensive linemen; last year they let guard Jon Runyan leave in free agency. They drafted a potential backup center last year in Jacob Monk (fifth round) and could even move right tackle Zach Tom there. It was hard to read Packers GM Brian Gutekunst, who in one answer talked about how much QB Jordan Love \"trusts [Myers] very much as center,\" but also offered a hint of finality when he said he was \"really glad we've had him for the last four years.\" -- Rob Demovsky\n\nMinnesota Vikings\n\nQB Sam Darnold\n\nThe Vikings face a difficult decision at quarterback considering Darnold's productive season and the presence of J.J. McCarthy, who has resumed on-field training after sitting out his rookie season because of a right knee injury. Darnold played at a Pro Bowl level for most of the season, but his performance cratered in the Vikings' final two games. He'll still probably earn more than the $10 million he earned in 2024. Do the Vikings need him back to cover for McCarthy's uncertain short-term future? Or will they decide to hand the keys to McCarthy and pair him with another veteran on a cheaper contract? -- Kevin Seifert\n\nNFC SOUTH\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nOLB Matthew Judon\n\nThe Falcons traded a 2024 third-round pick to the Patriots for Judon on the eve of the season, and at age 32 and coming off a biceps surgery, he didn't perform at the level he had previously. Judon had 15.5 sacks in 2022, his last healthy season, and 5.5 in 2024. Judon had four sacks in his final seven games and flashed some of that vintage pass-rushing ability, so for the right price, sack-starved Atlanta could bring him back for another go. -- Marc Raimondi\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\nLB Shaq Thompson\n\nFixing a defense that ranked last in the NFL is the top priority, and a healthy Thompson would go a long way toward doing that. The problem is he has played six games in two seasons because of injuries, and he'll be 31 before the 2025 season. Thompson wants to retire in Carolina, and he's a leader in the locker room, so finding a team-friendly deal makes him a priority. -- David Newton\n\nNew Orleans Saints\n\nCB Paulson Adebo\n\nAdebo is coming off a broken right femur but should be good to go for training camp. The question is how much the Saints are willing to pay him with Alontae Taylor and Kool-Aid McKinstry potentially the outside starters in 2025. Adebo's injury certainly complicates things and raises questions as to how much other teams would value him on the open market. -- Katherine Terrell\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nWR Chris Godwin\n\nThe Bucs have been here before, with Godwin facing a significant injury while set to become an unrestricted free agent. He sustained a torn ACL and MCL in 2021 and then signed a three-year deal worth $60 million in 2022. Godwin sustained a dislocated left ankle in October and was leading the NFL in catches and tied for the league lead in touchdowns at the time. \"He's an outstanding player. If we can sign him back at all, I'd love to have him back here,\" coach Todd Bowles said at the end of the season. It will come down to how much it would take to re-sign him. -- Jenna Laine\n\nNFC WEST\n\nArizona Cardinals\n\nRG Will Hernandez\n\nThe Cardinals probably will rebuild a chunk of their offensive line, and Hernandez will be part of that conversation. He started five games before sustaining a season-ending left knee injury in October but is expected to be ready for training camp, if not earlier. He has established himself as a reliable, consistent presence on the line, so if Arizona brings him back, it wouldn't be a surprise to anyone. -- Josh Weinfuss\n\nLos Angeles Rams\n\nLT Alaric Jackson\n\nThe Rams have a few decisions to make on their offensive line, and tackle could be a position they address early in the draft. Los Angeles doesn't have a left tackle in waiting, and right tackle Rob Havenstein has only one year left on his deal. According to ESPN Analytics, Jackson had the best season of his four-year NFL career, posting career highs in pass block win rate (90.3%) and run block win rate (78.1%). Jackson could return after testing the market but isn't likely the long-term solution at left tackle. -- Sarah Barshop\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\n\nLB Dre Greenlaw\n\nBased on talent, personality and production, keeping Greenlaw will be a priority, but also a difficult decision because of the cost. Greenlaw's extensive injury history complicates matters further. Since entering the league in 2019, Greenlaw has sat out 36 games because of quad, groin, calf, hamstring and Achilles injuries. He played in two games in 2024, which makes it difficult to peg a contract value. Assuming another team doesn't want to roll the dice on an expensive, long-term deal, the 49ers will have a chance to keep him, but that's far from a certainty. -- Nick Wagoner\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nLB Ernest Jones IV",

    "raw_text": "Tracking the offseason MLB trades and signings with fantasy baseball implications for the upcoming season, Eric Karabell and Tristan H. Cockcroft will analyze and provide an outlook for all of the key players involved.\n\nThe MLB offseason is in full swing. Juan Soto has signed with the New York Mets, Kyle Tucker has been traded to the Chicago Cubs and Cody Bellinger moves to the New York Yankees. Still, other big bats are still looking for a place to land, including Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso.\n\nMeanwhile, those Yankees addressed their rotation needs by adding Max Fried, Garrett Crochet traded in his White Sox for Boston's red variety, and Corbin Burnes has joined the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nNote: Not every transaction warrants the attention of fantasy managers, but for those signings and trades that do merit analysis, you'll find them listed below. Players will be separated by position and then listed in chronological order of the move within each positional grouping, with the latest news coming first. Also included are links to any standalone analysis stories and/or videos regarding major free agent signings and trades. Players who end up re-signing with their previous team will not always be included.\n\nJump to: Catcher | First base | Second base | Shortstop | Third base | Outfield | DH | Starting pitcher | Relief pitcher\n\nCatcher\n\nKyle Teel traded from Red Sox to White Sox: Teel, one of the better prospects in the sport, regardless of position (he ranked No. 34 overall in Kylie McDaniel's most recent top-100 MLB prospects) comes to Chicago in the Garrett Crochet trade, and he may make immediate impact with his new club. The No. 14 pick in the 2023 amateur draft offers modest power, but he hits for average, draws walks and possesses excellent on-base ability, which we all covet in points formats. Teel may need more Triple-A time in 2025, but he and fellow top prospect Edgar Quero could form a top tandem soon (or Quero may move to first base). Fantasy managers must pay attention to both of them. -- Karabell (12/11)\n\nGary Sanchez signs with Orioles: Sanchez is the rare backup catcher we can count on for double-digit home runs, since he has reached that mark in nine consecutive seasons. Adley Rutschman is the starter, and Sanchez will likely fill in behind the plate occasionally versus lefties. Still, it's enough to consider him in deeper, multi-catcher formats. -- Karabell (12/8)\n\nDanny Jansen signs with Rays: Jansen, 29, is hardly coming off his best offensive season, and he's certainly not the most durable catcher, but there is fantasy relevance as he remains in the AL East. Jansen hit 32 homers over a mere 549 PA in 2022-23 for Toronto. Even with roughly half a season of playing time, do not be surprised if he returns to top-20 catcher production with Tampa Bay. -- Karabell (12/6)\n\nKyle Higashioka signs with Rangers: Higashioka's only season with the Padres produced 17 homers and 134 ESPN fantasy points -- a top-30 figure for catchers. It might have been a career year, but Higashioka reached double-digit home runs for the fourth consecutive season, and he should split time in Texas with Jonah Heim, who struggled in 2024. Take Heim earlier in drafts, but Higashioka warrants deep-league attention. -- Karabell (12/3)\n\nTravis d'Arnaud signs with Angels: This is a bit of an odd one since the Angels boast much younger C Logan O'Hoppe, who has hit 34 homers over his past 721 PA (over two seasons). Perhaps they wish to corner the market on apostrophe-themed players? The Braves enjoyed d'Arnaud as he hit 44 homers over the past three seasons, mainly in a timeshare role, but he turns 36 in February and figures to see less playing time as a member of the Angels. That isn't ideal in fantasy. -- Karabell (11/12)\n\nOther selected free agents: James McCann\n\nFirst base\n\nJosh Bell signs with Nationals: This one seems a bit odd, since the Nationals recently traded for Nathaniel Lowe (see below), but Bell is a poor first baseman and should handle DH duties for this team. The switch-hitter posted arguably his best season for the 2021 Nationals, when he hit .261 with 27 homers, slugging .476 with a healthy walk rate. However, he hasn't slugged better than .422 for four franchises since then. Still, despite his travels over the last three seasons, he is durable, draws walks and should see enough volume to make him a potential top-20 first baseman in points formats. He's a worthy late-round selection there. -- Karabell (12/30)\n\nNathaniel Lowe traded from Rangers to Nationals: Similar to the Josh Naylor trade dump, the Rangers wanted to unload money, and Washington desired a competent first baseman. Lowe is merely OK, a durable walker who has hit more than 20 home runs in a season only once, so the comparison with Naylor ends there. Lowe makes more sense in points formats, but few enter a draft coveting him. Make him a late pick in standard formats and hope that he ends up being more than an OBP fellow. -- Karabell (12/23)\n\nJosh Naylor traded from Guardians to Diamondbacks: The productive Naylor reached career highs with 31 home runs, 108 RBI, 84 runs and 58 walks this past season, but his future contract situation directed the Guardians to move on. The No. 19 hitter in points formats (just ahead of Bryce Harper and Manny Machado), Naylor may deliver better numbers in Arizona, thanks to the positive change in home ballparks and getting nine fun road games in Denver, but he already was a worthy top-50 selection in points formats. This trade certainly does not hurt his value. -- Karabell (12/22)\n\nCarlos Santana signs with Guardians: A points-league bargain for the steady power and high walk rates for quite a long time, Santana returns to Cleveland, site of the best season of his lengthy career (34 HR and 108 walks in 2019). Santana, who turns 39 in April, won't help anyone's batting average, but his 23 homers and 65 walks for the 2024 Twins made him a top-60 hitter in points formats, despite being mostly ignored in drafts -- as per usual. Don't you dare ignore him in the latter rounds this season. -- Karabell (12/22)\n\nPaul Goldschmidt signs with Yankees: Goldschmidt, 37, comes off the worst season of his long career, posting merely a .716 OPS, but he did aid fantasy managers in roto/categories formats with 22 home runs and 11 stolen bases. He was the No. 25 first baseman in points formats, 17th in roto/categories formats, and well outside the top-150 overall in both.\n\nHowever, Goldschmidt enters a positive situation, on a one-year \"prove it\" deal, where he will not have to carry an offense, and he should have ample RBI opportunities following Aaron Judge in the lineup. Perhaps he can recover some lost bat speed and catch up to fastballs. Don't expect a return to his NL MVP performance from 2022, but rather something closer to his reasonable 2023 numbers, which makes him a worthy mid-to-late pick in standard formats. -- Karabell (12/21)\n\nChristian Walker signs with Astros: Walker has averaged 32 homers over his last three consistent seasons with the Diamondbacks, establishing himself as a top-10 first baseman. Moving to the Astros may even aid his production, with their unique left field porch. Walker isn't Pete Alonso or Matt Olson statistically, but he comes at a far greater draft day discount, making him an annual fantasy value. -- Karabell (12/20)\n\nSpencer Horwitz traded to Pirates: Horwitz was traded from the Blue Jays to the Guardians, then immediately flipped to the Pirates in a pretty good haul of speculative young pitching by the Guardians. Horwitz, who split his time for the Blue Jays almost evenly between first and second base, should man the former for his new team. He has a patience-and-contact approach that might make him a mixed-league sleeper in a better offense or venue, but the Pirates are neither (pending other offseason moves), with PNC Park being notoriously poor for power. -- Cockcroft (12/11)\n\nSelected free agents: Pete Alonso, Anthony Rizzo\n\nSecond base\n\nGavin Lux traded from Dodgers to Reds: Lux was expendable following the signing of Kim (see below). The Reds were the team who swooped in to acquire him. Fantasy owners might normally be thrilled with the destination, as the Reds play in one of the most hitter-friendly home environments in baseball, but it's a curious move on their part due to their infield depth. Will Lux be more of a part-time player than a true regular? Might Matt McLain, who dabbled at third base and in center field during his Arizona Fall League stint, be on the move to another position? We'll see once spring training begins, but Lux should be a useful fantasy \"matchups type\" against righties in his Great American Ball Park games regardless of how it all settles. -- Cockcroft (1/7)\n\nHyeseong Kim signs with Dodgers: Kim is a left-handed hitting base stealer from Korea who makes contact and hits for average (rather than for power) and drawing walks. While there is always a transition period for players coming over to MLB, this may be a valuable player. In fact, Kim, 25, figures to be more valuable for the Dodgers than to fantasy managers. While Kim played primarily second base in Korea, his versatility at all positions is a plus. Be more cautious of players like Kim (those lacking pop) for points formats, but we must be intrigued later in drafts. -- Karabell (1/4)\n\nGleyber Torres signs with Tigers: Torres comes off a disappointing season, as he hit 10 fewer home runs and stole nine fewer bases than in 2023, losing nearly 100 OPS points in the process. While he seems unlikely to ever recapture his 2019 numbers (38 HR), he remains capable of his relevant 2023-24 production -- and that is valuable at second base. It's enough to make Torres a top-150 option in both points and roto formats. The Tigers are far from loaded offensively, which won't help Torres accumulate RBI or runs as compared to his Yankees days. Expect Colt Keith to slide to first base. -- Karabell (12/27)\n\nCaleb Durbin traded from Yankees to Brewers: Durbin, 24, is a compelling infield prospect who recently set the stolen base mark in the Arizona Fall League, showing off his contact-oriented approach, speed and excellent plate discipline. The Brewers may present him with an opportunity to start right away, perhaps at third base, with Joey Ortiz moving to shortstop to replace the departed Willy Adames. Durbin, 2B-eligible in ESPN leagues, bats right-handed and may earn a coveted spot near the top of the Milwaukee lineup. Depending on how he performs in the spring, fantasy managers may consider him in the mid-to-late rounds of 2025 drafts. -- Karabell (12/13)\n\nAndres Gimenez traded from Guardians to Blue Jays: A defensive whiz whose best fantasy contribution to his new team might be the benefit he provides their pitchers, Gimenez has the kind of contact-and-speed game that can be nevertheless handy in fantasy baseball. He's much more of a rotisserie than points-based asset, with a high-water seasonal finish of 46th overall on the 2022 Player Rater, but he has never finished higher than 88th in fantasy points (his 2024 ranking).\n\nGimenez can be a high-floor player in points leagues, however, and he'll probably bat high in the Blue Jays order, boosting his runs scored total. He's a clear top-10 second baseman in roto play, but is more of a \"round out your lineup\" type in ESPN's standard points leagues. -- Cockcroft (12/10)\n\nThairo Estrada signs with Rockies: Estrada was a relevant fantasy option in 2022 and 2023, hitting 28 homers and stealing 44 bases for the Giants, but injuries set him back this past season, as he played in only 96 games. Heading to Colorado for half of his home games intrigues for sure. Estrada is a contact-inclined player who runs, and he should outperform the departed Brendan Rodgers, mainly for roto formats. -- Karabell (12/10)\n\nKyle Farmer signs with Rockies: Farmer comes off a rough season, but it wasn't too long ago he hit 30 homers over a two-season span for the Reds. The Rockies should utilize him as a reserve infielder versus left-handed pitching, but these are the Rockies, so who really knows? Fantasy managers should utilize Farmer in daily formats when facing a lefty. -- Karabell (11/22)\n\nJonathan India traded from Reds to Royals: India, the 2021 NL Rookie of the Year, played in a career-high 151 games last season, reaching double digits in both home runs and stolen bases for the third time. India isn't known for a high batting average, but he is particularly valuable in points leagues for his ability to reach base. Only four players drew more than his 80 walks last season. Playing half of his home games in Kansas City rather than Cincinnati might affect his power stats, but India's discipline should travel, and a spot atop his new lineup is likely. His value shouldn't change much. -- Karabell (11/22)\n\nOther selected free agents: Brandon Drury, Jorge Polanco, Adam Frazier\n\nShortstop\n\nHa-Seong Kim signs with Rays: Seeking to add some depth to an offense that averaged only 3.73 runs per game last season -- the franchise's worst single-season rate -- the Rays signed Kim, capable of handling second base, third base and shortstop. October shoulder surgery is expected to cost him at least the first month of the season, meaning he might initially be worked in via a utility or part-time role, but in quick time he should prove their best option at shortstop, ahead of Taylor Walls and Jose Caballero.\n\nFantasy managers can only hope that Kim's arrival won't take away any at-bats from blossoming power source Junior Caminero. Still, there should be plenty of opportunity up the middle -- remember that second baseman Brandon Lowe has an extensive injury history -- for Kim to be a solid, top-10 capable fantasy shortstop across the season's final 4-5 months. He's more of an in-season addition in standard ESPN leagues as his return date approaches, but he should be considered in the later rounds of any league that utilizes a larger portion of the player pool. -- Cockcroft (1/29)\n\nAmed Rosario signs with Nationals: Rosario played for the Reds, Dodgers and Rays in 2024, delivering a mediocre season that included only three home runs and 13 stolen bases over 103 games. He drew just nine walks, for a 2.6% rate. Rosario, a right-handed hitter with a .769 OPS versus left-handed pitching the past three seasons, figures to handle a utility role for his sixth team in six seasons, filling in against lefties but offering little fantasy value. -- Karabell (1/9)\n\nWilly Adames signs with Giants: The Giants, desperate for a shortstop, get the top available option. Adames slugged 32 homers for the Brewers while also delivering career bests with 112 RBI, 21 steals and 93 runs. Switching his home park to pitcher-friendly San Francisco may bring his numbers down a bit, but Adames, who hits right-handed, has hit considerably better versus right-handed pitching over the last three seasons -- so perhaps his home park is not a big deal. A 2024 top-20 hitter in both points and roto/category (where he is more valuable) formats, Adames should remain a relevant run-producer and a top-100 pick for 2025. -- Karabell (12/7)\n\nOther selected free agents: Enrique Hernandez, Paul DeJong, Garrett Hampson, Jose Iglesias\n\nThird base\n\nGio Urshela signs with Athletics: The well-traveled Urshela joins his eighth team (seventh in the AL), though he has never recaptured the glory from his 2019 season, when he hit .314 with 21 home runs. Urshela hit .250 with 9 homers for the Braves and Tigers last season. A solid defender at third base, Urshela may start regularly for a team playing half of its games in a minor league ballpark, so while we cannot call him intriguing for standard fantasy formats, he may be a worthy deep-league pick for power and volume stats. -- Karabell (12/20)\n\nIsaac Paredes traded from Cubs to Astros: After enduring two trades in the past five months alone, Paredes' fantasy value is fair to question, especially in light of his historically modest contact quality metrics and his ghastly .223/.325/.307 rates following his deadline deal to Chicago. He has averaged 23 homers and 74 RBI over the past three seasons, but hasn't registered Barrel or hard-hit rates above the 43rd percentile in any of those years, making those averages fair, if not slightly generous, baselines.\n\nThe Astros are surely banking upon his extreme-pull approach at the plate, as he had a MLB-leading 58 total HRs and 37% of batted balls going to \"far left field\" (within 18 degrees of the left-field foul pole) from 2022-24. That's why he should be a good fit for the soon-to-be Daikin Park (changing names from Minute Maid Park on Jan. 1) and its Crawford Boxes in left. Tuck that away as a matchup angle worth exploiting in daily formats. -- Cockcroft (12/13)\n\nSelected free agents: Alex Bregman, Yoan Moncada\n\nOutfield\n\nJurickson Profar signs with Braves: Profar, 31, comes off the best season of his mostly underachieving career, as the former top prospect hit .280 with 24 home runs, 10 steals and 94 runs playing left field for the Padres. Naturally, fantasy managers will be skeptical about him finishing among the top-15 hitters in fantasy points again, but heading to Atlanta is a solid result for Profar's value.\n\nProfar could hit leadoff until Ronald Acuna Jr. (knee) returns from injury and, if he thrives again while continuing this new version of himself that shined in exit velocity, he may maintain a strong spot in a deep lineup for months. Profar combines modest power with solid plate discipline and contact skills. Sometimes it takes longer for top prospects. No, we shouldn't expect him to be a top-15 fantasy hitter again, but don't let him slide outside the top 100 in points formats. -- Karabell (1/23)\n\nAnthony Santander signs with Blue Jays: The switch-hitting Santander turned his best MLB season into a long-term contract with Toronto, as he ripped 44 home runs for the Orioles, finishing sixth among outfielders in ESPN fantasy points and 14th among all hitters. Santander may not hit 44 blasts again, but he has established himself after a three-year run of consistent power, walk rate and durability, suiting up for 152-plus games each season. Expect him to provide top-50 fantasy performance in his new home. -- Karabell (1/20)\n\nMax Kepler signs with Phillies: This move shows the Phillies intend to play Brandon Marsh in center field. Kepler has never played left field in the majors, but here's his shot, at 32. Forget about the fellow who whacked 36 home runs in 2019. He's long gone. Still, the Phillies would take his 2023 campaign, when he hit .260 with 24 blasts, most of it versus right-handed pitching. Last season, Kepler slugged .380 (8 HR) in 398 PA, battling knee woes. Expect a platoon role in Philadelphia, and perhaps 20-plus homers. -- Karabell (12/20)\n\nCody Bellinger traded from Cubs to Yankees: One of the game's most statistically enigmatic players, Bellinger has experienced extreme peaks (see: 2019 MVP campaign, 2023 rebound) and valleys (see: 2021-22) in his stat lines, as well as sometimes head-scratching underlying metrics. Once an elite power hitter, he has now had sub-50th-percentile hard hit rates in four straight seasons and sub-50th Barrel rates in three of the last four. Even so, the trade-off has been a spike in contact, as he has set career bests in strikeout rate now in back-to-back seasons.\n\nBellinger is one of those players great at squaring up the ball, capable of carrying both real-life and fantasy teams during his hot spells, but at constant risk of regressing to .260, 20 HR,15 SB baselines. Fortunately, his penchant for pull power means that Yankee Stadium's short right field porch should help boost his home run production, so a 30/15 season is again within his reach.\n\nWhere he hits in the lineup -- he could slot as high as second or as low as sixth -- will have a bearing on his fantasy appeal, as batting ahead of Aaron Judge would give him his best chance at once again approaching his No. 11 Player Rater (and 28th-best in fantasy points) level of success from 2023. -- Cockcroft (12/17)\n\nKyle Tucker traded from Astros to Cubs: After managing at least 29 homers and 25 steals in both 2022 and 2023, Tucker was limited to just 73 games in 2024 after fracturing his right shin fouling a ball off his leg. It was a fluky injury unlikely to have long-term ramifications, and both his .365/.453/.587 rates in 18 games following his late-season return, as well as his continually top-shelf metrics over the course of the full year, suggest that he should be able to rebound to his former self in 2025.\n\nThe move to Wrigley Field, with its often unpredictable year-over-year park factors, could deflate some of his power potential, but not enough to have a noticeable impact on his fantasy production. As for the change in lineup support, bear in mind that the Astros scored only four more runs than the Cubs in 2024 (granted, in one fewer game), and Tucker seems much more likely to lock into a No. 2 or 3 spot in the lineup. That should help boost both his plate appearances and runs scored.\n\nHe's a first-round pick regardless of format, and one plenty capable of a 30/30 season as well as a 500-point fantasy total -- Cockcroft (12/13)\n\nJuan Soto signs with Mets: It's true, Citi Field is a much more pitching-friendly environment than Soto's single-year home, Yankee Stadium -- and particularly so for left-handed hitters ... (however) it's a fair assumption to think that Soto will be surrounded with a robust supporting cast that will only enhance his number of RBI and run-scoring opportunities. -- Cockcroft (12/9)\n\nWant more? Read the full story on the fantasy impact of Soto signing with the Mets.\n\nMichael Conforto signs with Dodgers: Last season, Conforto hit 20 home runs for the Giants, his first time reaching that number since 2019, though it was not enough to make him a top-50 outfielder for ESPN points formats. The Dodgers figure to utilize him in a similar platoon role, and fantasy managers should consider getting him into the lineup when he faces right-handed pitching. -- Karabell (12/8)\n\nTyler O'Neill signs with Orioles: O'Neill rebounded well enough in his lone Red Sox season to earn a lucrative free-agent contract, smashing 31 home runs after several injury-plagued campaigns. He also struck out a bloated 33.6% of his at-bats, posted a sub-.700 OPS versus right-handed pitching, and missed 49 games due to various maladies. When healthy, O'Neill should enjoy batting in Baltimore, with the left field fence being adjusted to be friendlier for hitters, but he remains a risky fantasy option for his plate approach and inconsistency. Be cautious in assuming that another top-100 fantasy campaign is on the way here. --Karabell (12/7)\n\nJose Siri traded from Rays to Mets: Siri is an excellent defensive center fielder, and a reasonable replacement to fill the Harrison Bader/Tyrone Taylor role in New York. As a hitter, Siri boasts modest power and speed, having amassed 43 homers and 26 steals over the past two seasons, but still he lacks much fantasy value after hitting just .187 with a 38% strikeout rate in 2024. Until Siri becomes more disciplined and makes more contact (which seems unlikely at this stage), avoid the lure of the counting numbers. -- Karabell (11/19)\n\nOther selected free agents: Mark Canha, Harrison Bader, Manuel Margot, Alex Verdugo\n\nDesignated hitter\n\nJoc Pederson signs with Rangers: Pederson's acquisition comes shortly after longtime 1B Nathaniel Lowe was abruptly/surprisingly traded to the Nationals, and better fills the team's need for left-handed power. The well-traveled Pederson posted the highest OPS of his career in 2024 -- a .908 mark for the Diamondbacks, nearly all of it coming versus right-handed pitching -- and he played nary an inning in the field. The Rangers figure to continue platooning him and, even with the stark change of home ballparks from hitter friendly Arizona to Texas, Pederson should surpass 20 homers for the seventh time and draw enough walks for late-round, points-league interest. -- Karabell (12/23)\n\nJake Burger traded from Marlins to Rangers: Burger has been a forgotten man the past year-plus while he played in an extreme pitchers' park and for a 62-100 Marlins team in 2024. He should immediately benefit by joining a much more potent lineup and moving to a noticeably better power environment at Globe Life Field. Burger will serve as the Rangers' designated hitter -- don't panic, Josh Jung managers! -- allowing Josh Smith to return to his traditional utilityman role, and should offer fantasy managers 30-plus homers (but 150-plus K's) on the cheap. -- Cockcroft (12/11)\n\nJorge Soler traded from Braves to Angels: We know what the well-traveled Soler is at this point, and he is more valuable than most realize. Soler, 32, has hit 57 home runs over the past two seasons for three clubs, and now he heads back to the AL, where he boasts a HR title for the 2019 Royals. Soler will never win a batting title or a Gold Glove, but consistent power and a double-digit walk rate every season cannot be ignored. He was the OF31 in ESPN points leagues in 2024, a bit underrated as he remained available in many leagues, and there is little reason to expect diminished performance in 2025. The acquisition works well for this power-starved lineup, although adding Soler likely means Mike Trout remains a regular outfielder. -- Karabell (10/31)\n\nOther selected free agents: Justin Turner, J.D. Martinez\n\nStarting pitcher\n\nMax Scherzer signs with Blue Jays: An eight-time All Star, three-time Cy Young Award winner and surefire future Hall of Famer, Scherzer remains fantasy-relevant even as he enters his age-40 season. Injuries have been his biggest recent hindrance, as he has made seven trips to the IL over the past four seasons alone (for a barrage of different ailments) but Scherzer's 22.6% strikeout rate and 92.5-mph average fastball velocity in 2024 -- both easily his worst in over a decade -- only serve to heighten concerns.\n\nScherzer's performance during spring training should tell us a lot about how much he can contribute in 2025. In Toronto, where the ballpark currently leans more pitcher-friendly than it once did, he will probably still be a late-round pick in 12-team mixed leagues of all formats, but a standout March could elevate his stock to that of a near-top-50 SP pick. -- Cockcroft (1/30)\n\nRoki Sasaki signs with Dodgers: Most ESPN fantasy managers will roster four or five starting pitchers they plan to have active for most, if not all of the season. The other spots are for relievers or streaming starters, to be used in a favorable matchup and then replaced. At SP46, Sasaki is on the borderline between being worthy of a season-long roster spot and being no more than a weekly streaming candidate. -- Todd Zola (1/17)\n\nWant more? Read the full story (E+) on what to expect from Sasaki signing with the Dodgers.\n\nJustin Verlander signs with Giants: San Francisco is one of the better landing spots for Verlander as he aims to chip away at the 38 more wins he needs to reach 300 for his career. Oracle Park was the fifth-most pitcher-friendly venue over the last three seasons, and the toughest in which to hit a home run. However, if you're hoping for a return of Verlander's glory years based upon the Giants' recent history of pitcher bounce-back success stories (Kevin Gausman, Anthony DeSclafani, Alex Wood, etc.), remember that Verlander's velocity is no longer what it once was. A modest rebound to back-of-the-staff mixed-league relevance -- or more likely becoming a streaks/streaming contributor -- is probably what lies ahead. -- Cockcroft (1/8)\n\nCharlie Morton signs with Orioles: The reliable, durable Morton returns to the AL East after four seasons with Atlanta, where he averaged 171 IP and 193 strikeouts, winning 45 total games with a 9.9 WAR. Morton, 41, certainly is not an ace anymore, but he is worth rostering in standard leagues -- even in Baltimore, which may play as more of a hitter's park this coming season. -- Karabell (1/4)\n\nCorbin Burnes signs with Diamondbacks: Fantasy baseball's No. 1 pitcher over the past five seasons -- his 2,083 points scored are 39 more than Zack Wheeler, and he's the only qualifier to place in the top 10 in wins, ERA, WHIP and strikeouts during that span -- Burnes heads to the desert with the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of consistent performance and now the new, high-profile contract to back it up. His arrival is not without concerns, however, as the right-hander has exhibited a steep decline in strikeouts going from a 35.6% rate during his 2021 Cy Young season to 30.5%, then to 25.5% and 23.1% last year -- that last number placing in the mere 51st percentile across MLB qualifiers.\n\nFantasy managers might see the Diamondbacks' six-year, $210 million commitment as a signal that all is OK with Burnes, and that the K's are certain to return. That's not necessarily so. Chase Field is a more hitting-friendly environment from an overall perspective than either Milwaukee's American Family Field or Baltimore's Camden Yards (Burnes' previous two homes), and especially so when its roof is open (generally during the earlier stages of season when temperatures in Phoenix aren't as extreme).\n\nBurnes finished SP10 in 2023 and SP8 in 2024, and a performance along those lines remains within reach. He remains my SP7 with the move, but make no mistake, he's a step beneath the top six that constitutes its own tier above him in the overall rankings. -- Cockcroft (12/28)\n\nWalker Buehler signs with Red Sox: Buehler earns a lucrative one-year deal as he attempts to reshape his value for a potential long-term contract after 2025. Will it happen? Buehler returned from Tommy John surgery and struggled for much of the 2024 regular season, posting a 5.38 ERA and a 1.55 WHIP, winning just one of his 16 Dodgers starts. He shined in the playoffs, though, and Boston takes a chance on intact stuff and past performance. Fantasy managers should not shut the door on Buehler returning to top-50 SP form, but don't pay up for that optimism on Draft Day, either. -- Karabell (12/23)\n\nJesus Luzardo traded from Marlins to Phillies: Luzardo fanned 208 hitters during a solid 2023, with a 3.58 ERA and a 1.21 WHIP. Fantasy managers loved the breakout. Things hardly went as well for him in 2024, as back and elbow injuries held the left-hander to 12 mostly ineffective starts. The Phillies, eyeing him for their No. 5 rotation spot, assume a healthy Luzardo will get his excellent stuff back (fastball, slider, changeup). However, the veteran of Oakland and Miami may find the extreme change in home ballparks striking. Fantasy managers should definitely take a chance on him in the late rounds, for we have seen what the top-20 version of Luzardo looks like. Hope for a top-50 version. -- Karabell (12/22)\n\nPatrick Sandoval signs with Red Sox: Sandoval signed a two-year deal with Boston, but he remains on the mend from internal brace surgery and may not pitch in a game until the All-Star break, at least. The lefty with the big changeup had times of relevance with the Angels, posting a 2.91 ERA in 2022, but his walk rate has risen too much since, making him tough to rely upon. If the Red Sox can help him find control, perhaps fantasy managers could have a late-season sleeper. -- Karabell (12/20)\n\nGriffin Canning signs with Mets (after being traded from Angels to Braves and then released): Canning pitched terribly in 2024, his 5.19 ERA being third worst among 59 qualifiers (ahead of only Patrick Corbin and Miles Mikolas) and only one pitcher (Kutter Crawford) permitted more than his 31 home runs. Canning, who has one year left on his contract, showed promise in 2023, earning a 25.9% strikeout rate with his pitch mix heavy in sliders and four-seamers. Mets starters overachieved this past season, so perhaps we should be a little intrigued as far as late-round picks go. -- Karabell (12/18)\n\nTomoyuki Sugano signs with Orioles: One of the older Japanese pitchers to make the move to the U.S., Sugano (who turned 35 in October) is no less accomplished than many of his predecessors. He's coming off a sparkling 2024 that saw him capture his third career Central League MVP award, posting a 15-3 record, a 1.67 ERA and 111 strikeouts in 156 2/3 innings for Yomiuri. He has a six-pitch mix (four-seam fastball, sinker, slider, cutter, curveball and forkball) that should help him make an immediate impact with the Orioles.\n\nSugano's control is his ticket to success. His 2.6% walk rate in 2024 was better than any MLB pitcher with at least 100 IP and his 4.7% career walk rate is better than any active pitcher with more than 400 innings. Even if his fastball no longer carries the velocity it once had during his prime, he should be one of the higher-floor, matchups-capable starters you'll find in the later rounds. Consider Sugano to be, on the high end, a top-50 SP option that you'll probably be able to acquire at a far cheaper rate. -- Cockcroft (12/17)\n\nJeffrey Springs traded from Rays to Athletics: Leaving Tampa Bay and its pitching-friendly Tropicana Field is a negative for Springs' fantasy value, as is his moving to the Athletics' rebuilding environment with much less bullpen support. To be fair, however, with the Rays slated to play at Tampa's George M. Steinbrenner Field for 2024, Springs was facing a park factor change anyway. He had a 2.08 ERA in his 18 career starts at The Trop, compared to 3.14 in his 17 Rays road starts, and concerns about the extreme temperatures at Sacramento's Sutter Health Park heighten the worry that the latter should be closer to his 2025 expectation.\n\nSprings' health history -- he had Tommy John surgery in April 2023 and missed the final three weeks of 2024 with further elbow fatigue -- adds worry that he'd be better off left to the free agent pool, freely streamed in mixed leagues, or someone to closely monitor for a promising spring training before investing. -- Cockcroft (12/16)\n\nNestor Cortes traded from Yankees to Brewers: Cortes was solid for much of 2024 before a flexor strain cost him the final weeks, but he still finished with a 3.77 ERA and a 1.15 WHIP. Fantasy managers may have noticed the diminished strikeout rate from prior seasons. The Brewers figure to give him as many starts as he can handle as he eats innings. It may not make for a top-50 fantasy starting pitcher, but there is value to be found here in deeper formats. -- Karabell (12/13)\n\nGarrett Crochet traded from White Sox to Red Sox: The Red Sox sure like trading with the White Sox for tall left-handers with major strikeout rates. Eight years after acquiring Chris Sale from Chicago, Boston sends several top prospects for Crochet, who posted a 35% strikeout rate over 32 starts in 2024, earning an AL All-Star berth. Crochet is currently nowhere near as accomplished as Sale was at the time, though. Sale had been earning Cy Young votes for five seasons. Crochet has yet to reach 150 innings in any season. Still, it's easy to project Crochet, 25, to be a legitimate ace with a contending team -- and a potential top-10 fantasy starter. For now, volume concerns leave him outside that range, but he's certainly a top-20 starter with upside lurks. -- Karabell (12/11)\n\nMax Fried signs with New York Yankees: As the Yankees forged ahead without Juan Soto, addressing their rotation was their first step. Adding Fried gives them a solid No. 2/3 starter (which depends upon where they slot Carlos Rodon), albeit one with a bit of injury risk.\n\nThough not a top-shelf fantasy starting pitcher, Fried has been consistently good across the past six seasons, finishing 38th among starting pitchers in 2019, 21st in 2020, 24th in 2021, 15th in 2022 and 31st most recently in 2024. Forearm issues cost him nearly three months of 2023 and three-plus weeks around the midpoint of last season, but one would think that his agreeing to an eight-year, $218 million deal means the Yankees were confident enough in his ability to stay healthy.\n\nFried should deliver about 30 of the highest-floor starts you'll find in fantasy drafts, though his ERA might increase a tick with the move to homer-friendly Yankee Stadium. Consider him a top-30 pick at his position. -- Cockcroft (12/10)\n\nAlex Cobb signs with Detroit Tigers: A plenty productive pitcher during his 2022-23 run with the Giants, placing 61st and 63rd among starting pitchers in fantasy points in those years, Cobb simply couldn't stay healthy in 2024. Between hip, hand, shoulder, finger and back issues, he was held to three regular-season and two postseason starts, albeit with similar performance to the two years that preceded it. The Tigers are surely banking on him staying healthier in 2025, though fantasy managers can freely \"pick and choose\" from his matchups rather than taking the plunge on draft day. -- Cockcroft (12/9)\n\nLuis Severino signs with Athletics: Few saw this one coming, but the Athletics are spending money -- and a lot of it -- for Severino, who resurrected his career with the 2024 Mets. He posted a reasonable 3.91 ERA over 31 starts, his most since 2018. Severino's strikeout rate looks little like the old Yankees days (though it improved over the final two months) as he wisely utilized a sinker to induce more soft contact and ground balls. The Athletics are scheduled to play half their games in Sacramento's minor league park, so keeping this ground ball strategy seems relevant.\n\nGive Severino credit. Few expected him to end up among the top-50 pitching scorers in ESPN standard points leagues this past season. His track record for health and his new, unfamiliar surroundings likely leaves him on the outside of that range for draft day -- but not by much. -- Karabell (12/5)\n\nFrankie Montas signs with Mets: Montas' return last season from shoulder issues went respectably, including 150\u2154 IP and 148 strikeouts, both his second-best numbers. Plus, an uptick in strikeouts following his deadline trade to the Brewers (28.7%, compared to 23.9% for his career) offers promise. Citi Field's more pitcher-friendly confines could boost his number of stream-worthy starts in mixed leagues. The ceiling for Montas isn't quite at 2021's peak level, however, so don't get too carried away with thoughts that the Mets' coaching staff -- which squeezed a lot out of Sean Manaea and Luis Severino in 2024 -- are bound to do it again. -- Cockcroft (12/2)\n\nMatthew Boyd signs with Cubs: Boyd's return from Tommy John surgery went about as well as anyone could have possibly expected. Check out his 2.28 ERA and 28.2% strikeout rate (including his postseason work), though also note that his average of 4.7 innings across 11 starts left a lot to be desired in fantasy terms. If he continues to show the heightened velocity and changeup effectiveness he had during his short spring training stint, he could be a sleeper/top-50 ceiling starting pitcher. Still, a pitcher with Boyd's recent track record in terms of health is a poor bet to reach the 150-IP threshold. -- Cockcroft (12/2)\n\nBlake Snell signs with Dodgers: The rich get richer and a fantasy ace only gets \"ace-ier.\" Snell's massive five-year, $182 million contract -- which includes a large signing bonus and deferrals, for those who fret about the salary cap -- reflects the elite level at which he can pitch, at least when he's healthy and in his midseason rhythm.\n\nTo illustrate, from the date of his July 9 return from a groin injury forward last season, Snell outscored every pitcher in fantasy baseball by 28 points (using ESPN's standard scoring), and every player except for the two league MVPs, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge. Additionally, Snell was the No. 6 SP during his 2018 AL Cy Young campaign, the No. 3 SP during his 2023 NL Cy Young campaign, the No. 2 SP over his final seven starts of 2021 and the No. 15 SP over the final three months of 2022.\n\nThe problem is that, outside of those specific time periods -- and all that above reflects plenty of \"great,\" to be sure -- Snell has a 15-22 record and 4.95 ERA over 67 starts, leaving him as an effectively unusable fantasy option during those times, outside of the fact that he still sported a 29.4% strikeout rate. This inconsistency is why landing with the Dodgers represents about the best possible spot for the left-hander, not only because of the maximized team support (read: lineup, bullpen), but also because the team is about the strongest proponent of the six-man rotation and rotational maintenance as there is.\n\nSnell might have chosen the best destination for lowering the risk involved in his fantasy investment, and he'll surely rank among the betting favorites for a third Cy Young Award for that reason. Now, that doesn't eliminate entirely the chance that, at age 32, Snell will miss additional time due to injury, but at least for 2025 he's lined up for a full spring training ramp-up -- a big contrast from his sluggish start to 2024 -- and a much-heightened floor. He now warrants consideration for a top-15 SP ranking in 2025 drafts. -- Cockcroft (11/27)\n\nYusei Kikuchi signs with Angels: The Japanese left-hander has always been a strikeout option (for the Mariners, Blue Jays, Astros and fantasy managers) and expectations figure to be higher in 2025 after he finished so strong for Houston. Kikuchi made 10 starts for the Astros after being acquired near the trade deadline, adjusting his pitch mix to rely heavily on sliders -- arguably his best pitch -- and he was far more effective versus right-handed batters. He averaged 11.3 ESPN fantasy points for the season, but 17.2 points for the Astros. One would think that Kikuchi will bring his new attacking style with him to the Angels, and fantasy managers might consider him as a potential top-40 starting pitcher. -- Karabell (11/25)\n\nBrady Singer traded from Royals to Reds: Singer bounced back in 2024 with modest numbers, though not as excellent as in his breakout 2022 campaign. He will have a rotation spot for the Reds, but switching home ballparks may be a problem. Singer has posted a 3.51 home ERA over the past three seasons but away from Kansas City's large park his ERA was 5.03. The Reds desired an innings-eater but fantasy managers may not enjoy the new results. -- Karabell (11/22)\n\nKyle Hendricks signs with Angels: Once upon a time, Hendricks was a reasonable fantasy option posting strong ERA and WHIP numbers for the Cubs. Now he's an Angel, but he won't be much of one for your fantasy team. Hendricks, 34, has been a below-average starter since 2020, and he was never much of a strikeout pitcher. Now he is even less of one. Hendricks is coming off his worst season and the Angels are desperate for innings. You shouldn't be. -- Karabell (11/6)\n\nOther selected free agents: Patrick Corbin, Jack Flaherty, Jose Quintana, Kyle Gibson, Andrew Heaney\n\nRelief pitcher\n\nCarlos Estevez signs with Royals: Although Kansas City already had an emerging closer in Lucas Erceg, who converted 14-of-16 save chances with a 3.46 ERA and 29.5% strikeout rate in his final 23 appearances (playoffs included), the addition of Estevez gives them another pitcher who could handle their ninth innings.\n\nAfter posting a career-high 27.8% strikeout rate in his first full season as a closer in 2023, Estevez improved his control to the point that his 5.7% walk rate last year was a personal-best. He gives the Royals a well above-average closing candidate, should the team want a committee arrangement or should Erceg, who has only 241 professional innings under his belt, not be up to the rigors of a 162-game schedule.\n\nMonitor this prospective closer battle during the spring, but for now consider Estevez to be a top-40 reliever. -- Cockcroft (1/30)\n\nRyan Pressly traded from Astros to Cubs Josh Hader's arrival in Houston last winter pushed Pressly into an eighth-inning role, from which his 35 years of age continued to show. He ended up recording his worst strikeout and whiff rates since 2016, and his fastball averaged a career-low 93.8 mph. Nevertheless, Pressly remained effective. His 25 holds placed 12th in the majors and his ground ball rate was again at 50%. He also posted a 2.63 ERA across the season's final three months. The move to Chicago is a boon to his fantasy value, as he'll almost assuredly be the Cubs' full-time closer in 2025, a role from which he'd have an outside chance at rebounding to top-10 positional numbers. -- Cockcroft (1/27)\n\nPaul Sewald signs with Guardians: Sewald saved 34 games between the Mariners and Diamondbacks in 2023, but he could not approach that number in 2024. Injuries both delayed and then ended his season prematurely, and in between he pitched inconsistently enough to lose the closer role. Cleveland boasts arguably the top closer in the sport, so unless Emmanuel Clase gets hurt or traded -- and even if he does, other Guardians, notably Cade Smith, are better suited to close -- fantasy managers should ignore Sewald, a 34-year-old journeyman who doesn't throw particularly hard. -- Karabell (1/23)\n\nKirby Yates signs with Dodgers: It didn't take long for the Dodgers to muddy recent saves projections by adding another potential closer to their bullpen. A few days earlier, LHP Tanner Scott joined the team, and we figured he would close, but certainly Yates may share the role with him.\n\nYates, 37, has thrown one career postseason inning (in 2023), so it makes sense for him to join a juggernaut and chase a World Series, even if he saves fewer games. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts probably opts for a combination of Yates and Scott to handle most save opportunities, especially with Michael Kopech injured.\n\nYates saved 33 games for the 2024 Rangers, posting a 1.17 ERA. Don't expect more than half that many saves this season, but he should provide excellent overall numbers nonetheless. -- Karabell (1/21)\n\nTanner Scott signs with Dodgers: Well, of course he did, right? Who doesn't end up with the Dodgers? Scott, 30, has been one of the top relief pitchers in the sport over the past two seasons, compiling a 2.04 ERA, a 2.53 FIP, a 1.05 WHIP, plus a 31% strikeout rate and a 7.6 bWAR. Now he joins the best team with a chance to finally pile on the saves.\n\nScott saved a career-best 22 saves last season for the Marlins and Padres. No Dodgers reliever has posted more than 25 saves since 2021 (Kenley Jansen), but a healthy Scott -- who was among the leaders in inducing weak contact and preventing high exit velocity -- should break that trend. RHPs Michael Kopech, Blake Treinen and Evan Phillips are all better suited for setup work.\n\nIn ESPN standard fantasy leagues, Scott should easily be selected among the top-15 closers and also among the top-100 players overall, depending on how many other pitchers the Dodgers end up signing. -- Karabell (1/19)\n\nJeff Hoffman signs with Blue Jays: Hoffman turned his career around with Philadelphia, posting a 2.28 ERA, 33% strikeout rate and 3.9 bWAR over 118 2/3 innings in two seasons, but now it may be time for him to really accumulate saves. He saved 11 games for the Phillies over two seasons. The Blue Jays went with RHP Chad Green in place of Jordan Romano last season, but Hoffman is an upgrade. It may also be relevant that Hoffman, drafted in 2014 in the first round by Toronto as a starter, may return to that role, and there are contract escalators in place in case his role adjusts. For now, a top-10 fantasy closer may lurk, though you will not need to invest him at that value. -- Karabell (1/11)\n\nDevin Williams traded from Brewers to Yankees: One of the preeminent relief pitchers in the sport, boasting a career 1.83 ERA, 1.02 WHIP and a 39% strikeout rate, Williams will pile on the saves closing for New York. He will be a free agent after the 2025 season, but the Yankees can worry about that later.\n\nWilliams missed the first four months of the 2024 season recovering from back problems, then used his devastating changeup and hard four-seamer to save 14 games with a 1.25 ERA during the final eight weeks. He should be one of the first relief pitchers selected in all fantasy leagues, while the Brewers figure to turn back to fastball-curveball specialist Trevor Megill, who saved 21 games in 2024. Megill is a big winner here, too. -- Karabell (12/13)\n\nJordan Romano signs with Phillies: Romano was among the top closers from 2021 through 2023 with the Blue Jays, saving 95 games with other solid numbers. The Phillies are banking on a return to that level of performance, if not necessarily that same role. Romano dealt with elbow issues and struggled in 2024. Don't even look at the statistics. They don't matter. A healthy Romano may close for the Phillies, but also be aware nobody has saved 30 games for Philadelphia since Jeanmar Gomez (remember him?!) back in 2016, as the franchise's long-standing committee approach bears watching. -- Karabell (12/9)\n\nClay Holmes signs with Mets: Holmes saved 74 games over the past three seasons for the other New York team and, while he lost the closing role during this past season -- 13 blown saves! -- he still brought fantasy value. The Mets, however, intend to utilize Holmes as a starter, which he last did (four times) in 2018. Edwin Diaz is safe as closer! Perhaps it all works out the way it did for standout Atlanta's Reynaldo Lopez, but fantasy managers should assume little. An extreme ground ball inducer who suppresses home runs, Holmes has the arsenal to start, but don't expect a high strikeout rate. He is more of a late-round sleeper pick than a sure thing . -- Karabell (12/6)\n\nAroldis Chapman signs with Red Sox: Chapman, third among active pitchers with 335 saves, might replace the fellow who leads the list, free agent Kenley Jansen, as the team's closer. The Red Sox also employ RHP Liam Hendriks (elbow), who did not pitch in 2024. The hard-throwing Chapman saved 14 games for last season's Pirates, with his most recent 30-save campaign coming for the 2021 Yankees. Chapman remains effective enough, as only six relief pitchers accrued more strikeouts last season, yet no reliever issued more walks. Neither Chapman nor Hendriks can be considered a top-10 RP in drafts until we have more clarity. This should be interesting. -- Karabell (12/3)",

    "raw_text": "Now that we have ranked the top 100 MLB prospects heading into the 2025 season (along with a look at the potential breakout players in the Nos. 101-200 range), let's look at how all 30 farm systems stack up -- and for the first time since 2021, someone other than the Baltimore Orioles is in the No. 1 spot.\n\nThese rankings were done, for the most part, the same way as my previous versions. While at FanGraphs, research by Craig Edwards (who now works for the MLB Players Association) revealed empirical surplus dollar values for each future value tier of prospect, so we can make an objective ranking of farm systems derived from my individual team lists, which will be published next week.\n\nA benefit of this approach is that you can use your own judgment to disagree with a ranking if, say, a team has $500,000 more talent, but the lower-ranked team has prospects of the sort you prefer. This gives you the tools to see exactly how close every team is and a more granular view of what their players are like, compared to the other 29 teams.\n\nSo just how bright does the future look for your favorite MLB team?\n\n2025 MLB prospect coverage: Top 100 prospects | Nos. 101-200\n\nJump to team's top-ranked prospect:\n\nAmerican League\n\nATH | BAL | BOS | CHW | CLE\n\nDET | HOU | KC | LAA | MIN\n\nNYY | SEA | TB | TEX | TOR\n\nNational League\n\nARI | ATL | CHC | CIN | COL\n\nLAD | MIA | MIL | NYM | PHI\n\nPIT | SD | SF | STL | WSH\n\n1. Los Angeles Dodgers ($420 million)\n\nLast year: 8th, $247 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 8\n\nYeah, nobody who isn't a Dodgers fan is excited to see this: The defending champs with the biggest payroll in baseball also have the best farm system. If it makes you feel any better, this isn't a record-breaking farm system value and the Dodgers' lead here is by a few million dollars less than Roki Sasaki's value. That means that approximately two months into the season, when Sasaki is expected to graduate from prospect eligibility, the Dodgers will likely lose the top spot. But two months is a lot of time when it comes to projecting prospect rankings so that could change.\n\nLos Angeles got here via a number of scouting and development avenues to maximize their system. Among their prospects on the top 100 list: Dalton Rushing was a top-50 overall pick, Alex Freeland was a third-round pick, Emil Morales got a top international bonus, Josue De Paula got a lower-to-midrange international bonus, and Jackson Ferris and Zyhir Hope were non-top 100 prospects a year ago when both were acquired from the Cubs for infielder Michael Busch. The Dodgers are so good because they are one of the most efficient franchises in baseball from top to bottom (you could argue for the Rays, Brewers or Guardians, too) and they also have a ton of money.\n\n2. Chicago White Sox ($313 million)\n\nLast year: 20th, $172 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 6\n\nTwo years ago at this time, the White Sox had the 25th-ranked farm system in baseball, then last year they moved up to 20th and last summer, after the trade deadline and draft, they moved up to eighth. And now, they are a Roki Sasaki away from having the top farm system in the game. Things haven't gone perfectly over that time, of course -- last season at the big league level couldn't have gone much worse, on multiple fronts -- but the franchise's accumulation and development of prospects has been effective.\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Noah Schultz is a potential front-line starter, infielder Colson Montgomery is a starter and maybe a good one, catchers Kyle Teel and Edgar Quero are also solid projected starters, and Hagen Smith should slot in right behind Schultz. All of them are on the top 100 and have a real shot at being in the big leagues in 2025 (which also means Chicago's stay at the top of the farm rankings could be a relatively short one).\n\n3. Detroit Tigers ($298 million)\n\nLast year: third, $318 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 4\n\nThe AL Central is having a scouting and development moment right now. The Twins and Guardians are continuing to do a solid job of cycling through new talent, but the Tigers and White Sox are also doing it now. Meanwhile, the Royals are contenders until proven otherwise. Detroit should graduate Jackson Jobe, Jace Jung, Brant Hurter, Trey Sweeney and Dillon Dingler pretty quickly this season.. But five of their top seven prospects won't graduate to the majors this season, including the ninth and 10th prospects in baseball: Max Clark and Kevin McGonigle. I'd expect Detroit's farm system to stay in the top 10 of these rankings for a good run.\n\n4. Boston Red Sox ($278 million)\n\nLast year: 13th, $223 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 3\n\nThe Red Sox have also been on a bit of a heater in the player development space, but they should lose their top-five farm system status at some point in 2025 as this ranking is driven heavily by three players who are all in the upper minors. Outfielder Roman Anthony (who will be the top prospect in baseball when Sasaki graduates), shortstop Marcelo Mayer and infielder Kristian Campbell combine for $172 million of the $278 million of value in Boston's system. There's a real shot at least two of them, if not all three, graduate to the big leagues at some point during the season. There's a nice wave of talent behind them, though, with shortstop Franklin Arias and outfielder Miguel Bleis leading the position players and right-hander Luis Perales (who likely won't pitch in a regular-season game until 2026) leading a lighter group of pitching prospects.\n\n5. Tampa Bay Rays ($270 million)\n\nLast year: 7th, $249 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 5\n\nHo hum, the Rays, as per usual, have a strong farm system. Shortstop Carson Williams paces their group as the fifth-ranked prospect in the game, but the strength here is their depth, with 13 prospects ranking between 63rd and 189th. That group was acquired in a variety of ways -- via trade, drafted from high school or college and signed internationally -- and has a strong bias toward position players. Even better for the Rays: The prospects have generally been acquired before or during their breakout, rather than the team waiting for industry consensus to form before it acts. Tampa Bay tends to start trends rather than follow them. This is the formula for ballin' on a budget.\n\n6. Minnesota Twins ($257 million)\n\nLast year: ninth, $241 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 4\n\nI've long been a Walker Jenkins believer -- I was blown away watching him, Tigers outfield prospect Max Clark and Giants first base prospect Bryce Eldridge dominating the prep players who were a year older than them back in 2021 -- and Jenkins is now on a trajectory to be the top prospect in the sport at some point this summer or next offseason.\n\nThe Twins run their organization similarly to the Rays, so a steady group of a half-dozen prospects of varying quality need to show up every year, and the scouting and development groups in Minnesota do that pretty darn well. I believe I'm the high guy in the media on RHP Charlee Soto and SS Kaelen Culpepper, so those are two picks to watch to be more prominent in the system later this season.\n\n7. Seattle Mariners ($241 million)\n\nLast year: 17th, $200 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 5\n\nSeattle continues to be on a heater when it comes to finding prep position players and college pitchers in the draft. SS Colt Emerson, 2B Cole Young, C Harry Ford, CF Jonny Farmelo, OF AIdan Smith (now with the Rays), SS Edwin Arroyo (now with the Reds) and SS Tai Peete have all been arrow-up since being drafted by Seattle. On the college pitcher side, you don't need to know prospects to understand how well it is working because Logan Gilbert, George Kirby, Bryce Miller and Bryan Woo were all picks from this regime -- and the next wave is forming behind them: Jurrangelo Cijntje, Brody Hopkins (now with the Rays), Teddy McGraw, Logan Evans and Brandyn Garcia.\n\nWhen a team finds that caramel ribbon of value creation in the tub of ice cream that is the draft, you have to double down and keep digging in until the caramel is gone. That was just a random metaphor, not a personal experience, of course.\n\n8. Milwaukee Brewers ($225 million)\n\nLast year: 5th, $276 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 4\n\nThe Brewers are the envy of baseball in some ways: productive international operations, skill in valuing in all parts of the draft, and ability to develop middling prospects into contributors for a perennial contender despite a bottom-10 payroll.\n\nJesus Made was the top prospect in the Dominican Summer League, going from midtier international signee to the middle of the top 100 in 51 pro games. Current major leaguer Jackson Chourio is also pretty good as a representative of their past international classes.\n\nThe Brew Crew have found a draft strategy that works for them, and they don't have much competition pursuing it: Identify Upper Midwest prep prospects for under $1 million bonuses, largely after the 10th round. Top 100 prospect Cooper Pratt was the result of some good, old-fashioned outscouting of the competition, and 3B Luke Adams and RHP Bishop Letson are the best finds so far from the Upper Midwest strategy.\n\n9. New York Mets ($222 million)\n\nLast year: 11th, $235 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 4\n\nSome of the smart moves the franchise made to pivot under former GM Billy Eppler are now giving way to president of baseball operations David Stearns' moves. As a result, the Mets now have a strong group of prospects in the upper minors with a real chance to contribute to the 2025 big league team.\n\nRonny Mauricio and Luisangel Acuna should be factors in the first half, and CF Drew Gilbert, IF/CF Jett Williams, RHP Brandon Sproat, RHP Nolan McLean and OF/1B Ryan Clifford could all be factors later in the season -- and they all rank within the top 200 prospects in the game. Keep an eye on RHP Jonah Tong to see if his incredible miss rates continue in the upper minors.\n\n10. Chicago Cubs ($215 million)\n\nLast year: 2nd, $328 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 5\n\nLike the Mets, the Cubs also have a wealth of prospects, mostly position players, in the upper minors who could be a real factor in the 2025 season. 3B Matt Shaw is tracking like an Opening Day starter. C Moises Ballesteros, 2B James Triantos, CF Kevin Alcantara, RF Owen Caissie, RHP Cade Horton and RHP Brandon Birdsell all are likely to open the season in Triple-A.\n\nFive of those players made the top 100, one is ranked among the 101-200, and one just missed. If even half of those players are solid big leaguers in 2025, that changes the team-building posture of a franchise with Kyle Tucker and Ryan Pressly hitting free agency after this season followed by Ian Happ, Seiya Suzuki, Nico Hoerner and Jameson Taillon the next year. Replacing some of those players with graduated prospects making the league minimum frees up a lot of money with one fewer roster need.\n\n11. Cleveland Guardians ($213 million)\n\nLast year: 19th, $187 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 3\n\nThe Guardians have to stay in the top half of these rankings for their model to continue to work, and they have demonstrated they can do that consistently with Travis Bazzana and Chase DeLauter leading a deep group of position players at the top of the system.\n\nCleveland has a very productive international program, pumping out a few new versions of \"plus hitter with short arms who plays an important position\" every year. The Guardians' approach to the draft is somewhat predictable (targeting young-for-their-class high schoolers, long-famous summer circuit performers, midround college pitchers), but it keeps working.\n\n12. Washington Nationals ($212 million)\n\nLast year: 16th, $203 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 4\n\nThe rebuild is starting to turn the corner in D.C., with some clear keepers graduating to the big league club and another wave likely to show up in 2025.\n\nDylan Crews, Brady House and Cade Cavalli should join James Wood, C.J. Abrams, MacKenzie Gore, D.J. Herz, Mitchell Parker and Jake Irvin in the group of former prospects becoming core major league players. With a strong 2025 showing, the wave coming behind them -- led by RHP Jarlin Susana, RHP Travis Sykora, LHP Alex Clemmey and SS Seaver King -- could be what turns a solid rebuild into a young contending core. That next wave should be helped further by a 2025 draft haul that will be headlined by the top overall pick.\n\n13. Cincinnati Reds ($210 million)\n\nLast year: 10th, $237 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 4\n\nThe Reds' rebuild is being built around potential front-line power pitchers. Hunter Greene is already doing it in the majors, Nick Lodolo is showing flashes, and they're about to be joined by Chase Burns, Rhett Lowder and Chase Petty.\n\nI don't think any of Cincinnati's top position player prospects will spend much time in the big leagues in 2025, but infielders Sal Stewart, Edwin Arroyo and Cam Collier figure to be factors for the 2026 season. By then we'll likely know if catcher Alfredo Duno is a potential All-Star or more of a limited player with huge power.\n\n14. Baltimore Orioles ($207 million)\n\nLast year: 1st, $371 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 3\n\nThe Orioles had the top farm system in the game before the 2022, 2023 and 2024 seasons, keeping the spot through my post-deadline rankings last summer. But with Jackson Holliday and Cade Povich graduating from eligibility after those rankings -- coming on the heels of Heston Kjerstad, Jordan Westburg and Colton Cowser moving up and prospects dealt away in trades for major league starters Zach Eflin, Trevor Rogers and Corbin Burnes -- the Baltimore system has thinned out considerably. The O's still have two of the top 20 prospects in the game in 3B Coby Mayo and C Samuel Basallo leading the system, with big league inventory arms and lower-level position players supplying much of the value after them.\n\n15. Miami Marlins ($197 million)\n\nLast year: 29th, $82 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 3\n\nThe Marlins are right in the middle of their rebuild, having moved almost every arbitration-eligible player in the organization for prospect value and bottoming out in the standings. They've accumulated young talent effectively, with a number of potential lineup regulars and starting pitchers set for a 2025 debut, but none of the players close to the majors seem like true future stars.\n\nIn the lower minors, there is some star potential, with LHP Thomas White leading the way. Miami should be able to add some more of that type of talent in the next couple of drafts and international signing classes, and will continue to climb up this list over that time.\n\n16. Texas Rangers ($192 million)\n\nLast year: 12th, $228 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 3\n\nThe Rangers' system has been one of baseball's most volatile recently: RHP Kumar Rocker's and RHP Jack Leiter's past few seasons have been a roller coaster, SS Sebastian Walcott went from interesting international signee to a top-20 prospect in the game pretty quickly, RHP Alejandro Rosario and RHP Winston Santos rose almost out of nowhere, and RHP Brock Porter, RHP Owen White and 1B Abimelec Ortiz have varied wildly in value year-to-year.\n\nThe big league lineup looks strong and the pitching in the system -- led by Rocker, Rosario, Santos and Leiter -- is about to show up to fortify the major league staff behind Nathan Eovaldi, Jacob deGrom & Co.\n\n17. Philadelphia Phillies ($188 million)\n\nLast year: 23rd, $158 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 3\n\nFor the Phillies, prospects are more of a means to an end. It's great if homegrown young big leaguers turn into stars such as Aaron Nola, or strong contributors such as Alec Bohm and Bryson Stott, but this team is built by players coming from all different places. The price was high at the trade deadline for Philly to acquire a rental in right-handed reliever Carlos Estevez (the 88th and 111th prospects), but right-hander Andrew Painter and shortstop Aidan Miller are likely prospects the team wouldn't include in trade discussions -- so they might soon join Nola & Co. as the homegrown stars of the next phase of the Phils.\n\n18. Colorado Rockies ($185 million)\n\nLast year: 22nd, $161 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 2\n\nThe Rockies' scouting groups actually do a pretty good job. I was getting worried about right-handed pitcher Chase Dollander before the 2022 draft, but he has turned into the best version of himself. There's a yellow flag to monitor for third baseman Charlie Condon, but I think he'll be fine in the long term. Outfielder Robert Calaz has a shot to be a home run-hitting machine at Coors Field, but he's still a teenager, so it could take a while to get there. There's some solid depth in role player-types in Colorado's system, but it just doesn't seem like there's enough young talent to right the wrongs committed at the big league level.\n\n19. St. Louis Cardinals ($184 million)\n\nLast year: 18th, $193 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 3\n\nThe Cardinals have some strong upper-minors pitching depth in right-handers Tink Hence, Michael McGreevy and Tekoah Roby and left-handers Quinn Mathews and Cooper Hjerpe -- and I'd expect to see shortstops JJ Wetherholt and Thomas Saggese as well as catchers Leonardo Bernal and Jimmy Crooks in the upper minors in 2025. I'd bet there will be some All-Star appearances among that group, which is increasingly what the Cardinals need from their system. Their organizational payroll posture is effective at filling out a core with solid contributors, but they need to out-scout the competition to find stars since they haven't been interested in paying retail price in free agency.\n\nThere are only two players in the organization with contracts guaranteed after 2026. St. Louis is in the middle of trying to trade one of them (Nolan Arenado), which bodes well for flexibility, but the core needs to be bolstered by standout young players, whether that's prospects or recent graduates.\n\n20. Pittsburgh Pirates ($179 million)\n\nLast year: 14th, $222 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 4\n\nThe whole organization has a different feel after the emergence of Paul Skenes. Oneil Cruz might be the only other potential star on the big league roster, but that's two more than some teams have and Bubba Chandler could make it a trio by the middle of 2025. Konnor Griffin is arguably the prospect with the highest variance in the top 100, so he certainly could turn into a superstar; however, this system is in a brief downcycle as the big league team is full of the last couple years of graduates. Pittsburgh might have to now start to balance competing in the short term and long term, a welcome change after six straight losing seasons.\n\n21. New York Yankees ($166 million)\n\nLast year: 6th, $252 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 2\n\nThe Yankees' system took a bit of a tumble in these rankings since last year after graduating standout rookies, catcher Austin Wells and right-hander Luis Gil, and making trades for Jazz Chisholm Jr., Mark Leiter Jr. and Devin Williams. At the same time, it wasn't a great year for the prospects who stayed in the system: Spencer Jones didn't progress as expected, Chase Hampton was injured much of the year, a handful of others fit one or both of those descriptions and the draft/international capital was at the low end of the scale due to the big league team's success and payroll. I think that was more clustered bad luck than anything systemic, and only Jasson Dominguez is expected to graduate in the first half of 2025 -- so I'd expect the rest of the farm to appreciate this year.\n\n22. Kansas City Royals ($163 million)\n\nLast year: 26th, $89 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 2\n\nKansas City has transitioned quickly from the difficult final stages of a rebuild to competing, thanks in large part to a superstar turn from shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. (which was somewhat expected) but also left-hander Cole Ragans going from low-profile trade return to ace in less than a year. The Royals' past two first-round picks -- catcher Blake Mitchell and first baseman Jac Caglianone -- are in the top half of the top 100, and left-hander David Shields is already arrow-up due to a velocity spike before even throwing in a regular-season big league game. Beyond that, it's mostly role players and high variance types in this system.\n\n23. Athletics ($160 million)\n\nLast year: 25th, $112 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 2\n\nThe A's have a nice wave of upper minors talent that should show up in the big leagues soon (or, briefly, already has): shortstop Jacob Wilson, first baseman Nick Kurtz, shortstop Max Muncy, right-hander Mason Barnett, center fielder Denzel Clarke, left fielder Colby Thomas and right-hander Jack Perkins. That group is coming up on the heels of recent graduates Lawrence Butler and Mason Miller, along with the emergence of designated hitter Brent Rooker and the payroll increase. All of that combined gives some hope that the on-field personnel can be better than in recent years, despite the current situation in which ownership has created.\n\n24. Toronto Blue Jays ($151 million)\n\nLast year: 24th, $126 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 3\n\nToronto took some tough blows to its system last season, losing left-handers Ricky Tiedemann and Brandon Barriera as well as right-hander Landen Maroudis to elbow surgery and second baseman Orelvis Martinez to a PED suspension. Things aren't really looking up for that group either: Though Martinez returned late in 2024, Barriera won't return until late in 2025, Maroudis might throw in summer/fall of 2025 (or wait until 2026) and Tiedemann won't return until the 2026 season.\n\nOn the bright side, shortstop Arjun Nimmala caught fire late in the season after some early struggles, right-hander Jake Bloss was acquired in a great deadline deal for Yusei Kikuchi, left-hander Adam Macko got to Triple-A while posting a career high in innings and a late injury in college helped deliver right-hander Trey Yesavage to the Jays at No. 20 in last summer's draft. Bloss and Martinez should graduate this season, meaning Toronto will need some steps forward from others in its system to make up for the loss of those two.\n\n25. Arizona Diamondbacks ($139 million)\n\nLast year: 21st, $168 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 1\n\nJordan Lawlar is the lone potential All-Star in the system but there are multiple waves of solid role players throughout the minors. Arizona added a nice mix of prospects with its two extra Day 1 picks in the 2024 draft, a late pick 2B Demetrio Crisantes (a seventh-round pick in 2022) turned into a near-top 100 prospect in 2024 and the D-backs' international program continues to produce real prospects, in Jansel Luis, Yu-Min Lin, Yilber Diaz and Adriel Radney, among others.\n\n26. San Diego Padres ($135 million)\n\nLast year: 4th, $284 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 2\n\nThe Padres are an organization of extremes, stomping the pedal to the floor in whatever direction they're going at the moment. Right now, it's all-in for the big league team and at the top of the international market, while trying to make the most of lesser draft capital tied to their perennial contender status.\n\nLeodalis De Vries and Ethan Salas are both potential stars in the top quarter of the top 100, while their most recent first-round pick, LHP Kash Mayfield, snuck onto the end of the top 200. After that, it's almost entirely higher-variance players in the low minors and a handful of big league inventory types. I bet it won't take long to beef up the rest of the system enough to make another bold trade though.\n\n27. Atlanta Braves ($133 million)\n\nLast year: 28th, $87 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 2\n\nThe Braves have done a nice job adding to their system status in the past year, with RHP Spencer Schwellenbach a notable but lone graduate from the top of last year's list. Atlanta has now signed top-of-the-market prospects in consecutive international signing classes and had multiple midtier prospects take leaps forward last season. I was the high guy last winter on C Drake Baldwin and SS Nacho Alvarez Jr., and they both rewarded my belief. RHP Owen Murphy was in the middle of a top 100-looking breakout season before elbow surgery shelved him for the year. LHP Cam Caminiti, a 2024 first-rounder, and post-surgery former first-rounder RHP J.R. Ritchie will try to make up for Murphy's loss. RHP Garrett Baumann and RHP Lucas Braun took big steps forward in 2024, and CF Luis Guanipa is one of the more intriguing low minors position players I'll be monitoring early in 2025.\n\n28. Los Angeles Angels ($129 million)\n\nLast year: 30th, $66 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 3\n\nThe Angels did strong work in the minors last season, more than doubling their farm system value. RHP Caden Dana took a big step forward and looks like a real midrotation starter now. Second baseman Christian Moore immediately raked in the minors after going No. 8 overall in the draft. The biggest move the Angels made was a fantastic trade, netting RHP George Klassen and LHP Samuel Aldegheri for a rental of RHP Carlos Estevez. All four of those players could be in the upper minors in 2025 and we know GM Perry Minasian will promote them aggressively.\n\nKeep an eye on potential relievers RHP Chris Cortez and RHP Ryan Johnson, two more potential quick movers from the 2024 draft, if they're throwing in short stints -- but they could also end up being slower movers if they're developed as starters only.\n\n29. San Francisco Giants ($109 million)\n\nLast year: 15th, $207 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 1\n\nThere have been a lot of graduations from this system over the past two seasons: SS Tyler Fitzgerald, OF Heliot Ramos, C Patrick Bailey, OF Grant McCray, 3B Casey Schmitt, SS Marco Luciano, OF Luis Matos, LHP Kyle Harrison, RHP Ryan Walker, RHP Hayden Birdsong and half a dozen more pitchers from lower prospect tiers.\n\nThat leaves the last two to three draft and international signing classes to fill the farm system, and there are potential stars in 1B Bryce Eldridge and recently signed SS Josuar Gonzalez along with role-player types in LHP Carson Whisenhunt and RF James Tibbs III. There isn't a lot of high-end talent, but there's nice depth. This is a down cycle after graduating so many young players; I'd bet the Giants rank a good bit higher at this time next year.\n\n30. Houston Astros ($104 million)\n\nLast year: 27th, $88 million\n\nTop 100 prospects: 2\n\nThird baseman Cam Smith was one of the key players Houston received in the Kyle Tucker trade, and adding him helped rescue this system value from being lower than it was at this point last winter, as the other teams with lagging systems all improved. Outfielder Jacob Melton (Houston's other top-100 prospect) should graduate this season, as should 3B Zach Dezenzo, with Smith having an outside chance.",

    "raw_text": "All eyes might be on the upcoming Chiefs-Eagles matchup in Super Bowl LIX, but let's not forget that NFL free agency is only six weeks away. Teams can negotiate with players over the March 10-11 period before the free agency window officially opens at 4 p.m. ET on March 12. Who could land big new deals?\n\nWith the help of national reporter Jeremy Fowler, I looked at the group of players primed to hit unrestricted free agency -- because of either expiring contracts or deals in line to void -- and ranked the top 50 who might end up available, starting with an elite offensive playmaker. Factors in building the list include age, positional value, expected future production, scheme versatility and what we're hearing around the league. In fact, Fowler included his latest buzz for a bunch of the free agents listed below.\n\nThis ranking could change a lot before we actually reach free agency, with teams extending their stars or applying the franchise tag. We will have an updated top 100 in March to cover us there. But for now, here are the top 50 pending free agents -- including three quarterbacks. Let's stack the free agent class.\n\nJump to the top-ranked:\n\nQB | RB | WR | OL | DL | LB | DB\n\n1. Tee Higgins, WR\n\n2024 team: Cincinnati Bengals | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nHiggins is just entering his prime playing years and is our top free agent for the 2025 class. At 6-foot-4 and 219 pounds, he can win on the boundary or create matchups from inside alignments. And despite playing alongside Ja'Marr Chase in Cincinnati, Higgins is the closest thing to a No. 1 receiver in this year's group. Injuries limited him to 12 games in 2024, yet he still finished with 73 receptions for 911 yards. His 10 touchdown catches tied for sixth most in the league.\n\nFowler's latest: Some executives are skeptical that Cincinnati can pay both Higgins and Chase. \"It's possible, but would require some significant trade-offs,\" an AFC exec said. \"They will have close to $70 million a year tied up in receivers, plus the quarterback cost. I think it makes more sense to go the cheap route, especially given the improvements they need to make on defense.\"\n\n2. Trey Smith, G\n\n2024 team: Kansas City Chiefs | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nSmith is a powerful mover in the run game, as his run block win rate of 75.1% ranks sixth among guards. In pass protection, he has the foot speed to mirror interior defenders and the strength at 6-6, 321 pounds to anchor against bull rushes. Given his traits and age, Smith should reset the market at the position.\n\nFowler's latest: Some inside the league are watching Chicago here. General manager Ryan Poles, who needs to drastically improve his interior offensive line for new coach Ben Johnson, was in Kansas City when the Chiefs drafted Smith. Several teams have him as the top overall free agent.\n\n3. Ronnie Stanley, OT\n\n2024 team: Baltimore Ravens | Age entering 2025 season: 31\n\nAt 6-6 and 310 pounds, Stanley can use his long frame to build a wall on the edge. He played the entire regular season, answering some questions on his durability, and also has the high-end tape to get paid. Stanley tied for 11th among offensive tackles with a 92.5% pass block win rate in 2024.\n\n4. D.J. Reed, CB\n\n2024 team: New York Jets | Age entering 2025 season: 28\n\nReed is a highly competitive coverage corner with press-man traits and the transition speed to break on the throw. More of a ball disruptor than playmaker, over his career he has 40 pass breakups, compared with six interceptions. Reed should be viewed as a scheme-versatile corner who can fit in multiple NFL systems.\n\nFowler's latest: Several teams we've polled agree Reed is the top corner in free agency. Roughly 10 teams have a glaring need at the position.\n\n5. Chris Godwin, WR\n\n2024 team: Tampa Bay Buccaneers | Age entering 2025 season: 29\n\nGodwin suffered a season-ending left ankle injury in Week 7, but there's no denying his production level. His 50 receptions over the first seven games were the most in the NFL up to that point, and he caught 30 of them out of the slot. A savvy route runner with the toughness to work the heavy-traffic areas of the field, Godwin has the veteran traits to upgrade any wide receiver room.\n\nFowler's latest: Multiple execs expect the Bucs to try to re-sign Godwin, who has that Buc-for-life feel similar to Mike Evans.\n\n6. Sam Darnold, QB\n\n2024 team: Minnesota Vikings | Age entering 2025 season: 28\n\nDarnold had a bounce-back year under Kevin O'Connell in Minnesota, as his 4,319 passing yards and 35 touchdown throws both ranked fifth in the league. His decision-making late in the down is still questionable, and he had a 14.8 QBR over the Vikings' two losses to end the season. But with his arm strength and mobility, Darnold will have options on the market given the need for the position across the league.\n\nFowler's latest: Several execs have Darnold in that Baker Mayfield range of contracts, which is around three years and $100 million with strong guarantees. The Raiders and Giants -- both picking outside the top two spots in the draft -- might need to pay a quarterback.\n\n7. Khalil Mack, Edge\n\n2024 team: Los Angeles Chargers | Age entering 2025 season: 34\n\nMack's game has aged gracefully after 11 pro seasons. He had six sacks and 41 pressures this season, and he can heat up the pocket. With 107.5 career sacks and steady play speed, Mack is still a three-down force based on the tape.\n\nFowler's latest: The sense is Los Angeles will make efforts to re-sign Mack, who will play in 2025 after he said he needed to take time to mull his future following the season. The Chargers believe he embodies the spirit of the team's toughness. But many teams will be lurking for potential pass-rush help, including -- but not limited to -- Atlanta and Carolina.\n\n8. Charvarius Ward, CB\n\n2024 team: San Francisco 49ers | Age entering 2025 season: 29\n\nWard has the man coverage ability to press or pedal off the ball, along with the backfield vision to make plays in zone coverage. He posted career-best numbers in 2023, with five interceptions and 14 pass breakups. And while he didn't create the same on-the-ball production this season -- zero picks and five pass breakups in 12 games played -- Ward's experience and technique could upgrade any secondary.\n\n9. Josh Sweat, Edge\n\n2024 team: Philadelphia Eagles | Age entering 2025 season: 28\n\nA productive rusher in Vic Fangio's front in Philadelphia, Sweat had eight sacks and 33 pressures this season. He's a long, angular mover who can win with speed-to-power, and he has built-in counters to disengage from offensive tackles. Given his age, positional value and the ability to hit the quarterback, Sweat makes our top 10.\n\nFowler's latest: Sweat will enter free agency with the flexibility to play in a 3-4 or 4-3 defense. He has ties to Arizona, where his former defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon is running the show. Washington, New England, Tampa Bay and Tennessee could be on the radar, too.\n\n10. Osa Odighizuwa, DT\n\n2024 team: Dallas Cowboys | Age entering 2025 season: 27\n\nA disruptive defender who can bring energy and impact-play ability to the defensive front, Odighizuwa had 4.5 sacks this season. His 30 pressures were tied with the Jets' Quinnen Williams for the second most among defensive tackles. Odighizuwa fits best as a 3-technique and can be a pass-rushing threat in nickel fronts.\n\nFowler's latest: Teams we've talked to think Odighizuwa is the top defensive tackle because of his versatility, durability and pass-rush traits. Washington is a team to potentially watch -- coach Dan Quinn has been big fan of Odighizuwa from their Dallas days together.\n\n11. Jevon Holland, S\n\n2024 team: Miami Dolphins | Age entering 2025 season: 25\n\nHolland has the multidimensional traits that pro coaches look for at safety. He can play from depth, cover in the slot or mix it up as a box defender. The splash plays were missing from Holland's tape this season, as he failed to record an interception. But he does have 5 interceptions, 16 pass breakups, 5 forced fumbles and 5 sacks over his four years with Miami.\n\n12. Zack Baun, LB\n\n2024 team: Philadelphia Eagles | Age entering 2025 season: 28\n\nBaun had a breakout season in Philadelphia under Fangio, recording 150 tackles, 3.5 sacks, 5 forced fumbles and 1 interception. He is a versatile off-ball linebacker with three-down ability, and he can set an edge due to his physical style. Baun should cash in after signing a one-year deal with the Eagles last offseason.\n\n13. Tre'von Moehrig, S\n\n2024 team: Las Vegas Raiders | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nAn ascending player, Moehrig notched five interceptions and 12 pass breakups over the past two seasons. He had five tackles for loss in 2024. He has the range to play from depth, and he is a tone-setter on contact when he spins down into the front.\n\nFowler's latest: Multiple personnel evaluators we've spoken to believe Moehrig's 2024 film was the best of any free agent safety. The Raiders will have a hard time keeping him.\n\n14. Cam Robinson, OT\n\n2024 team: Minnesota Vikings | Age entering 2025 season: 29\n\nAt 6-6 and 335 pounds, Robinson has the ideal size, length and traits for the tackle position. Technical lapses have prevented him from playing at a consistent level, and his 88.2% pass block win rate was below average. But with the ability to engulf rushers at the point of attack and the foot speed to redirect, Robinson has the desired tools at the tackle position.\n\nFowler's latest: Robinson quite possibly played his way above the $20-million-per-year threshold, with the recent precedent of Garett Bolles' four-year, $82 million deal in Denver as a comp. The Rams and Chiefs are among teams that could be looking for left tackle help. And a return to Minnesota isn't totally off the table, after the Vikings traded for Robinson at midseason.\n\n15. Dre Greenlaw, LB\n\n2024 team: San Francisco 49ers | Age entering 2025 season: 28\n\nGreenlaw played in only two games this season (Weeks 15-16) after tearing an Achilles in Super Bowl LVIII. At full strength -- which he is expected to be in 2025 -- he has the traits to make an impact in any defensive scheme as an off-ball defender. Greenlaw is a rangy linebacker with the pursuit speed to track ball carriers and the coverage awareness to close throwing windows. He had back-to-back seasons of 120-plus tackles in 2022-23, and he added 1.5 sacks last year.\n\n16. Milton Williams, DT\n\n2024 team: Philadelphia Eagles | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nWilliams has the strength to displace blockers at the point of attack, with the light feet and short-area burst to slip interior offensive linemen as a pass rusher. He had five sacks and 18 pressures in 2024 with the Eagles. The arrow is pointing up.\n\n17. Haason Reddick, Edge\n\n2024 team: New York Jets | Age entering 2025 season: 30\n\nAt 6-1 and 240 pounds, Reddick is a scheme-specific pass rusher with a quick first step and the ability to bend on the edge. After being traded to the Jets and holding out to start the season, Reddick had one sack and 15 pressures in 10 games. However, he has a history of impact plays, with 59 sacks and 18 forced fumbles over his career. And before this season, he put together three straight campaigns with a pass rush win rate over 20%.\n\nFowler's latest: Jets sources swear that Reddick can still be a double-digit-sack guy, and that the turbulent offseason with the team contributed mightily to his uneven 2024 campaign.\n\n18. Amari Cooper, WR\n\n2024 team: Buffalo Bills | Age entering 2025 season: 31\n\nCooper's tape is beginning to show signs of decline, but he is still a detailed route runner who can uncover at multiple levels of the field. In 14 games with both the Browns and Bills this season, Cooper caught 44 passes for 547 yards and four touchdowns. In nine full seasons, Cooper has topped the 1,000-yard receiving mark seven times and has 64 career touchdown catches.\n\nFowler's latest: The Bills have been happy with Cooper, despite low production compared with past seasons. He has been a good team player in Buffalo, and the Bills are intrigued by getting him into a full offseason program with quarterback Josh Allen. Though his free agency future is uncertain, a return to Buffalo does not appear off the table.\n\n19. Will Fries, G\n\n2024 team: Indianapolis Colts | Age entering 2025 season: 27\n\nBefore a right tibia injury ended his season in Week 5, Fries had posted career bests in both pass block win rate (92.4%) and run block win rate (74.3%). He might lack high-end traits, but the tape tells us he can upgrade the interior of an offensive front. He has a fundamentally sound play style, the lower-body mobility to handle power rushers and an ability to sustain blocks on contact.\n\nFowler's latest: Fries expects to be fully cleared by the beginning of free agency, and he'll attract serious interest.\n\n20. Byron Murphy Jr., CB\n\n2024 team: Minnesota Vikings | Age entering 2025 season: 27\n\nMurphy's six interceptions tied for the third most in the league, and he has 14 over his six-year career. With the ability to play on the perimeter or in the slot (259 snaps in 2024), Murphy has the backfield vision and short-area speed to close on the ball.\n\nFowler's latest: Sources say Murphy will be looking for a rather large raise from the two-year, $17.5 million deal he just played out in Minnesota. He has played his way into bigger money.\n\n21. Zack Martin, G\n\n2024 team: Dallas Cowboys | Age entering 2025 season: 34\n\nIf Martin returns for a 12th season, he'll still bring the blend of size (6-4, 315 pounds) and mobility coaches want at the guard position. But he's not as springy as he used to be, and he can be attacked on his edges. This season, Martin played in only 10 games due to a right ankle injury, and his pass block win rate of 93.7% ranked 15th among guards.\n\n22. Talanoa Hufanga, S\n\n2024 team: San Francisco 49ers | Age entering 2025 season: 25\n\nInjuries have limited Hufanga to 17 games over the past two seasons. However, the former All-Pro is a natural disruptor when he's healthy. In 49 career games, Hufanga has 7 interceptions, 2 forced fumbles and 1 defensive touchdown. He is at his best in a defined coverage scheme that allows him to play in split-field alignments and spin down to roam the front.\n\n23. Carlton Davis III, CB\n\n2024 team: Detroit Lions | Age entering 2025 season: 28\n\nDavis started 13 games for the Lions before a broken jaw landed him on injured reserve. The veteran corner has man and zone traits, which will give him options on the market; plus, he is a willing tackler on the edges. In seven seasons, he has 11 interceptions and 68 pass breakups. He can create on-ball disruption.\n\nFowler's latest: Some teams have Davis as the No. 2 corner in the class. Watch for Jacksonville to potentially make a move here. The Jaguars likely won't be huge spenders in free agency, but they want to fortify their secondary.\n\n24. Nick Bolton, LB\n\n2024 team: Kansas City Chiefs | Age entering 2025 season: 25\n\nBolton's demeanor and quick play recognition fit well in Kansas City, where he has averaged eight tackles per game over four seasons. He's a downhill thumper against the run, with 11 tackles for loss this season. In coverage, Bolton lacks elite second-level range, but he can get to depth in zone looks or match up inside. He has four career interceptions.\n\nFowler's latest: The Chiefs and Bolton are expected to discuss a potential extension after the season, but the team has many players to pay and might not prioritize linebacker. Bolton is a Steve Spagnuolo favorite and one of the leaders of the defense.\n\n25. Rasul Douglas, CB\n\n2024 team: Buffalo Bills | Age entering 2025 season: 30\n\nDouglas is a physical corner with the length to disrupt the ball and the willingness to set an edge against the run (five tackles for loss this season). He's an easy fit in a zone system that allows him to reroute underneath and attack the ball from the outside third of the field. Douglas returned one of his five interceptions for a touchdown in 2023, and he had five pass breakups this past season.\n\nFowler's latest: Douglas is certainly open to staying in Buffalo, but the Bills, who have a penchant for paying in-house talent, could choose to prioritize young cornerback Christian Benford. Douglas will have a strong market among zone-heavy teams.\n\n26. Stefon Diggs, WR\n\n2024 team: Houston Texans | Age entering 2025 season: 31\n\nAn ACL injury limited Diggs to eight games this season, which is why he's lower on this list. His play speed is also starting to slip. However, Diggs is a quality route runner who, once heathy and cleared to play next season, can create separation and produce after the catch. Diggs had 47 receptions for 496 yards this season, and he has 70 touchdowns over his 10 years in the NFL.\n\n27. Drew Dalman, C\n\n2024 team: Atlanta Falcons | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nDalman, who had an ankle injury, played in nine games for Atlanta this season. He wins his assignments with movement and leverage to offset a smaller frame (6-3, 300 pounds). Dalman is a technician on the tape, best suited for the zone run game, and his pass block win rate of 95.1% ranked ninth among centers with at least 500 snaps.\n\nFowler's latest: As the main guy at the position in a soft market, Dalman has a chance to receive top-three money among centers, surpassing Lloyd Cushenberry III's four-year, $50 million deal with the Titans in 2024. Chicago needs to address its interior offensive line, and New England also could be among teams looking for center help.\n\n28. Malcolm Koonce, Edge\n\n2024 team: Las Vegas Raiders | Age entering 2025 season: 27\n\nA knee injury in early September erased Koonce's 2024 season before it even started. But he posted eight sacks and 29 pressures in 2023. If the knee checks out, Koonce should be viewed as a three-down defensive end with the pass-rush juice to disrupt the pocket.\n\n29. Camryn Bynum, S\n\n2024 team: Minnesota Vikings | Age entering 2025 season: 27\n\nHe's a glider over the top who can also fill alleys against the run. Bynum saw his value rise in Brian Flores' defensive system in Minnesota. Over the past two seasons, he has 233 tackles, 5 interceptions and 12 pass breakups. He's an interchangeable safety who can produce in multiple systems.\n\nFowler's latest: The Vikings and Bynum have had discussions about an extension. While nothing has materialized, both sides are open to it, and this could get done before mid-March.\n\n30. Mekhi Becton, G\n\n2024 team: Philadelphia Eagles | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nThe 2020 first-round offensive tackle bumped inside to guard this season after signing a one-year contract with the Eagles. He uses his massive 6-7, 363-pound frame to overwhelm and move defenders in the run game. He has the physical tools and footwork to also win as a pass protector, though. Just entering his prime years, Becton should see interest as a guard or tackle.\n\n31. Asante Samuel Jr., CB\n\n2024 team: Los Angeles Chargers | Age entering 2025 season: 25\n\nSamuel has a playmaking mentality at cornerback, with the foot quickness and sudden closing speed to break on the ball. A shoulder injury limited Samuel to four games this season, but he has six interceptions and 26 pass breakups in his four years with the Chargers.\n\n32. Justin Fields, QB\n\n2024 team: Pittsburgh Steelers | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nIn six starts with the Steelers, Fields displayed improved footwork and vision in the pocket, completing 66.3% of his throws with five touchdown passes and one interception. He also rushed for 289 yards and five more scores on 62 carries. If Fields lands in a system that maximizes his dual-threat traits, he could be viewed as a lower-level starter.\n\n33. Aaron Jones, RB\n\n2024 team: Minnesota Vikings | Age entering 2025 season: 30\n\nJones is a slasher in the run game and has the dual-threat traits to catch the ball out of the backfield, with 51 receptions and 1,546 total yards for the Vikings in 2024. He is at his best in a zone run scheme that will highlight his receiving skills.\n\nFowler's latest: Expect Denver to look for a versatile back to bolster Sean Payton's offense. Could Jones fit the mold despite his age? He's the kind of runner/pass catcher who just might.\n\n34. Mike Hilton, CB\n\n2024 team: Cincinnati Bengals | Age entering 2025 season: 31\n\nA slot corner who plays with a sense of urgency, Hilton had 12 tackles for loss and eight pressures this season. He has a natural feel for playing in space as a coverage defender with the aggressive mentality to tackle and blitz on the edges. In eight seasons, Hilton has 13 interceptions, 11.5 sacks and 34 pass breakups.\n\n35. Kevin Zeitler, G\n\n2024 team: Detroit Lions | Age entering 2025 season: 35\n\nZeitler is a physical inside presence with the power to displace defensive tackles and the movement ability to pull on gap schemes. He routinely wins in pass protection, using his strong base to hold off interior rushers. Zeitler had a pass block win rate of 94.4% with Detroit last season, his 13th year in the league.\n\n36. Darius Slayton, WR\n\n2024 team: New York Giants | Age entering 2025 season: 28\n\nSlayton caught 39 passes and averaged 14.2 yards per reception in 2024 despite subpar QB play. He's a vertical stretch target on the perimeter who can also work the in-breaking cuts in the route tree. And he has ability to make explosive plays, with 58 receptions of 20 or more yards over his six seasons with the Giants.\n\nFowler's latest: Don't sleep on a robust free agency for Slayton. Several teams will be looking for top-end speed on the outside, and Slayton has that. He paid his dues in a bad offense and will likely be looking for a Darnell Mooney-type contract (three years, $39 million). Carolina would make some sense here.\n\n37. Jamien Sherwood, LB\n\n2024 team: New York Jets | Age entering 2025 season: 25\n\nThe tape is trending up on Sherwood after he posted 154 tackles, 10 tackles for loss and 3 pass breakups with the Jets this season. Sherwood can play downhill with speed, cutting off the ball and pursuing the edges. And I see coverage upside here, too. Sherwood is a three-down player with special teams coverage ability, and his best football is ahead of him.\n\nFowler's latest: Three different personnel evaluators brought up Sherwood to me unprompted when discussing the free agency class. Watch for Atlanta, which features a lot of former Jets staffing, or San Francisco, where former Jets coach Robert Saleh now runs the defense.\n\n38. James Daniels, G\n\n2024 team: Pittsburgh Steelers | Age entering 2025 season: 27\n\nA torn Achilles suffered in Week 4 pushed Daniels down our ranks. But he provides run-blocking upside when healthy. From Weeks 1 to 4, Daniels' run block win rate of 82.7% ranked second among guards behind the Colts' Quenton Nelson. And over three seasons with the Steelers, Daniels had a pass block win rate of 93.1%.\n\n39. Chase Young, Edge\n\n2024 team: New Orleans Saints | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nYoung notched 5.5 sacks with the Saints, and his 46 pressures tied for the 11th most in the league. The No. 2 pick in the 2020 draft is still in his prime years and can add depth to a defensive line room.\n\nFowler's latest: Young is open to a return to New Orleans, where he just played out a one-year deal -- though a different defense could generate more sack opportunities for him. He might opt for stability over last year's prove-it-deal status coming off a serious neck injury.\n\n40. Alaric Jackson, OT\n\n2024 team: Los Angeles Rams | Age entering 2025 season: 27\n\nWith his 6-7, 345-pound frame, Jackson has the play strength to anchor against power off the edge, and he understands how to win with positioning. He isn't a natural displacer on contact, but with 35 career starts, he can upgrade a team in need of a left tackle.\n\nFowler's latest: Jackson might have priced himself out of Los Angeles, proving to be a reliable starting tackle with upside. He's known in the Rams building as a hard worker, and with more consistency he can become a top-15, top-20 left tackle. New England, which needs improvements along the line, is a potential fit.\n\n41. Teven Jenkins, G\n\n2024 team: Chicago Bears | Age entering 2025 season: 27\n\nJenkins' extensive injury history forced him down the rankings, as he has played in only 38 of a possible 68 career games. Drafted as a tackle, Jenkins has the tools to drive defenders off the ball in the run game. But he tends to be more segmented as a mover in pass protection.\n\n42. Russell Wilson, QB\n\n2024 team: Pittsburgh Steelers | Age entering 2025 season: 36\n\nIn 11 starts for the Steelers, Wilson completed 63.7% of his throws for 2,482 yards and 16 touchdowns, registering a QBR of 51.4 (22nd). He can still throw with pace and touch downfield, and he would benefit from a system that's heavy in play-action. But with his reduced mobility, Wilson isn't a creator outside of structure at this stage of his career.\n\nFowler's latest: Is a reunion with Pete Carroll, now Las Vegas' head coach, really viable? Two ex-Carroll assistants believe they can coexist, with one taking it as far as predicting that Wilson will sign there, adding that the two rekindled their relationship a little over a year ago after a rocky ending the Seattle.\n\n\"I think both would be open to it, especially with this QB class the way it is,\" another ex-Carroll coach said. The Raiders' plans are uncertain, but this at least seems like a possibility.\n\n43. Justin Reid, S\n\n2024 team: Kansas City Chiefs | Age entering 2025 season: 28\n\nA veteran presence in the secondary, Reid can drop the hammer as a downhill tackler. He fits in today's split-safety coverage schemes, too, due to his vision and field awareness. In three years with the Chiefs, Reid has 261 tackles, 4 sacks, 3 interceptions and 14 pass breakups.\n\n44. Paulson Adebo, CB\n\n2024 team: New Orleans Saints | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nAdebo would be in our top 20 if he hadn't suffered a broken femur in Week 7. He has the frame and traits to play press coverage, plus he can open and run when matching vertically on the perimeter. In four seasons with the Saints, Adebo has 10 interceptions and 23 pass breakups.\n\nFowler's latest: Multiple teams consider Adebo a top-three corner in the free agency class based on ability and upside. Adebo had no complications from his surgery, which included a rod being placed in the broken bone -- where there was a clean fracture -- to stabilize it.\n\n45. Ryan Kelly, C\n\n2024 team: Indianapolis Colts | Age entering 2025 season: 32\n\nInjuries limited Kelly to 10 games this season with the Colts. An on-the-field leader with excellent football awareness, Kelly had a pass block win rate of 95.9% (sixth best among centers) and didn't allow a sack. Plus, he plays with a physical demeanor to constantly win in the run game.\n\n46. Ernest Jones IV, LB\n\n2024 team: Seattle Seahawks | Age entering 2025 season: 25\n\nJones -- who landed in Seattle after a midseason trade from the Titans -- is quick to diagnose and stop the run game, as his 8.6 tackles per game ranked 12th in the NFL. Although Jones' tape is missing the impact plays, he's a steady second-level defender with the field awareness to track the ball and hit.\n\nFowler's latest: The Seahawks could follow the Leonard Williams blueprint from last spring, reaching a new deal around the start of free agency. The belief is both sides want to keep this relationship going.\n\n47. J.K. Dobbins, RB\n\n2024 team: Los Angeles Chargers | Age entering 2025 season: 26\n\nAfter tearing an Achilles in Week 1 of 2023, Dobbins looked explosive on the tape throughout this season, though he missed four games because of a knee sprain. Dobbins, who had 27 carries of 10 or more yards, finished 2024 with 907 rushing yards and seven touchdowns. He can run between the tackles, and he has the juice to create big plays.\n\n48. Juwan Johnson, TE\n\n2024 team: New Orleans Saints | Age entering 2025 season: 28\n\nJohnson posted the best numbers of his career in 2024, catching 50 of 65 targets for 548 yards and three touchdowns. He can work the interior seams with his 6-4 frame, and he gets loose on underneath throws (38.7% of his total yardage this season came after the catch).\n\n49. Keenan Allen, WR\n\n2024 team: Chicago Bears | Age entering 2025 season: 33\n\nAllen caught 70 passes in Chicago, leading to seven touchdown receptions. He isn't as dynamic of a mover at this late stage of his career, but the veteran receiver is a crafty route runner who can make himself available to the quarterback. He fits as a chain-moving No. 3 receiver, which is the role he played for the Bears this season.\n\n50. Najee Harris, RB\n\n2024 team: Pittsburgh Steelers | Age entering 2025 season: 27\n\nA volume grinder, Harris averaged 15.5 carries per game for Pittsburgh in 2024, and he topped the 1,000-yard rushing mark for the fourth straight year. While Harris isn't a sudden mover with perimeter speed, he can handle downhill volume as an early-down runner and catch the ball out of the backfield on underneath throws.\n\nJust missed",

    "raw_text": "While two NFL teams are thinking about the biggest stage in sports next weekend, the other 30 are preparing for next season. Every team is likely to attempt what the Eagles and general manager Howie Roseman did last offseason, when the Birds shored up the weak spots on their roster by adding two All-Pros and a handful of other valuable contributors.\n\nOne way to do that? Acquire players off the league's best rosters. A year ago, Sam Darnold was preparing for Super Bowl LVIII as the backup to Brock Purdy in San Francisco. He ended up winning 14 games for the Vikings this season. On the other side of the ball, Nick Allegretti quietly put together a solid game for the Chiefs as Joe Thuney's replacement at guard, showing enough to become one of the many free agents who joined the Commanders in free agency. Allegretti shockingly came within one game of making it back to the title game with his new team.\n\nSubscribe: 'The Bill Barnwell Show'\n\nLet's run through the intriguing free agency and cut decisions for the Chiefs, Eagles and the other 12 playoff teams (in order of seeding in both conferences) and try to figure out which players might be joining other organizations this offseason. I'll touch on the top priority for each team and the potential veterans who could be released or otherwise moved on for cap reasons. It seems natural to start with the Eagles, who did an incredible job of retooling after they fell apart in the second half of last season. Saquon Barkley isn't going anywhere, but can Roseman keep his other All-Pro addition?\n\nJump to a team:\n\nBills | Bucs | Broncos\n\nChargers | Chiefs | Commanders\n\nEagles | Lions | Packers | Rams\n\nRavens | Steelers | Texans | Vikings\n\nAFC playoff teams\n\nKansas City Chiefs (1)\n\nProjected cap space: $16.3 million (23rd in the league)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: LB Nick Bolton, WR Marquise Brown, WR Mecole Hardman, RB Kareem Hunt, WR DeAndre Hopkins, OT D.J. Humphries, DT Derrick Nnadi, DE Charles Omenihu, RB Samaje Perine, S Justin Reid, G Trey Smith, WR JuJu Smith-Schuster, WR Justin Watson, QB Carson Wentz, DL Tershawn Wharton\n\nTop priority: Smith. The 2021 sixth-round pick is a great run blocker who made his first Pro Bowl this season, but the Chiefs have a tough decision to make about how much they want to invest in positions they might not classify as essential. General manager Brett Veach handed center Creed Humphrey a four-year, $72 million deal last August, a market resetting contract at a position where the prior high-water mark was $13.5 million per year. Star guard Joe Thuney is entering the final year of his five-year, $80 million contract, and right tackle Jawaan Taylor has one year of guaranteed money left on his four-year, $80 million pact.\n\nWith left tackle a clear point of weakness for the Chiefs among Humphries, Wanya Morris and rookie Kingsley Suamataia this season, would Veach commit significant money to three interior linemen? Thuney is currently playing left tackle out of necessity, but I would be surprised if they shifted him there as the full-time starter in 2025. Offensive line coach Andy Heck has an excellent track record of developing interior linemen, and the organization has been comfortable letting talented players leave in previous years (Mitch Morse and Rodney Hudson, for example). It's always easy to justify retaining linemen to protect Patrick Mahomes, but I wonder if Kansas City might find a better use of that money elsewhere with the idea it will develop a replacement for Smith in the draft.\n\nThat money could instead go to Bolton, whose range as a tackler has helped the Chiefs' run defense take a step forward. He has missed more tackles than usual this season, but he has also been valuable as a green dog rusher, and his speed and quickness play up in Kansas City's blitz-heavy packages. As a player who doesn't turn 25 until March, Bolton will be one of the youngest free agents on the market, which will attract analytically inclined teams that prioritize youth when they pursue veterans. He's also likely to come in on a smaller deal than Smith given the spike at the top of the guard market a year ago, which could make him a more palatable re-signing option.\n\nJustin Reid has essentially been a replacement for Tyrann Mathieu since joining from the Texans in 2022, and his versatility as a deep zone defender, tackler and potential blitzer have made his deal a success. While the exploding guard market might make it harder for the Chiefs to retain Smith, the collapse of the safety market during that same offseason could help them retain Reid. As a player who turns 28 in February, Reid should still be productive on a third contract.\n\nThe Chiefs' wide receivers potentially hitting the market have more in the way of names than production at this point of their respective careers. Hopkins felt like a potential postseason stash when the Chiefs traded for him at midseason, but he has played just 28 snaps and has one catch during the playoffs. As a contested catch/physicality wideout who doesn't play special teams, has injury issues in his recent past and turns 33 in June, he isn't going to have a huge market. He's probably at the same place in his career Julio Jones was when the future Hall of Famer finished up with the Bucs and Eagles.\n\nAndy Reid has found roles for Smith-Schuster and Watson as bigger wide receivers in multi-TE sets, but the most interesting wideout of the bunch is Brown, who spent most of the season on injured reserve (shoulder) before returning in December. He was targeted on a whopping 45.5% of the routes he ran in a limited role during the regular season, suggesting Reid had some concepts specifically dialed up for him, but that has cooled to 18.4% during the playoffs. With Rashee Rice returning from a torn ACL, another one-year deal for Brown in the $7 million range would make sense, although Kansas City might want to shop for a bigger wideout in the same price range.\n\nPotential candidates for release: None. The Chiefs don't have anyone who would generate significant cap savings by being released. Taylor and linebacker Drue Tranquill have guaranteed base salaries in 2025, which would make them plausible trade candidates as opposed to players likely to be released.\n\nThe Chiefs will create cap space by restructuring Mahomes' deal, which should free up about $39 million. They could use some of that money to retain Bolton and Reid, but they also have an expensive class of young talent becoming eligible for extensions this offseason, including edge rusher George Karlaftis and cornerback Trent McDuffie.\n\nBuffalo Bills (2)\n\nProjected cap space: Minus-$2.5 million (27th)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: WR Amari Cooper, CB Rasul Douglas, FB Reggie Gilliam, S Damar Hamlin, WR Mack Hollins, DT Quinton Jefferson, RB Ty Johnson, DT Jordan Phillips, DL Dawuane Smoot\n\nTop priority: Douglas. That negative cap space number is scary, but I'll address it in a moment. The Bills will bring most of their core back; the only players on this list who played more than 20 snaps per game on offense and defense are Douglas, Hamlin and Hollins, none of whom has the sort of prohibitive market in free agency that would keep Buffalo from competing. Douglas has been a solid starter since the team acquired him from the Packers in October 2023, but 30-year-old cornerbacks are usually looking at short-term deals for modest money.\n\nCooper's situation will be interesting. The Bills traded a third-round pick as the focal point of their package to acquire him from the Browns, which is a lot for a player in the final year of his deal. The former Raiders and Cowboys wideout never caught on in Buffalo, though, with injuries limiting him to 297 receiving yards over eight games in the regular season and just 41 more yards across three postseason games.\n\nWhile Cooper is one year removed from a 1,250-yard season, the market for veteran wideouts on the wrong side of 30 is often disappointing. Mike Evans, the picture of consistency in Tampa Bay, landed only a two-year, $41 million deal with $29 million guaranteed as a 30-year-old last offseason, and he was coming off a 1,255-yard, 13-touchdown campaign. Cooper's deal should come in closer to Adam Thielen's three-year, $25 million contract with the Panthers, which guaranteed only $14 million.\n\nThere's uncertainty there. The Bills probably traded for Cooper hoping they would get a productive year out of him and either re-sign him or recoup a meaningful compensatory pick. The latter doesn't seem likely after his injury-marred campaign, but if he doesn't have a huge market, they might actually find themselves in position to re-sign him at a reasonable price.\n\nPotential candidates for release: Edge Von Miller. It would be shocking if the 35-year-old returned to the Bills, given that he has been limited to a part-time role since tearing his ACL in 2022 and was suspended for four games for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy. The Broncos legend had six sacks and 25 pressures on 186 pass-rush opportunities in 2024, with his 13.4% pressure rate ranking fifth in the league in a small sample, so it wouldn't be a surprise if there would be a market for his services.\n\nThat market won't get to $17.4 million, though, which is what the Bills would pay him if he was on the active roster next season. Designating Miller as a post-June 1 release would free up that same $17.4 million in cap space. Buffalo could also look at a new deal for Josh Allen as a potential source for cap flexibility, although that's more likely to come a year from now given the structure of the quarterback's contract.\n\nBaltimore Ravens (3)\n\nProjected cap space: $9.3 million (24th)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: WR Nelson Agholor, LB Chris Board, LB Malik Harrison, OL Patrick Mekari, FB Patrick Ricard, CB Brandon Stephens, OT Ronnie Stanley, DL Brent Urban\n\nTop priority: Stanley. After taking a pay cut to stay with the team in 2024, he had his best season since suffering a career-altering ankle injury in 2020. NFL Next Gen Stats data credited him with 3.5 sacks allowed all season, and crucially, he stayed healthy and played a full 17-game schedule. The Ravens rotated Stanley at times last season, but outside of a few moments when he sat out in garbage time, the 2019 All-Pro was an every-down left tackle.\n\nStanley's market will be tough to gauge. There will be teams with serious reservations about his health, and there are organizations that likely don't want to make a serious commitment to a soon-to-be 31-year-old player who has struggled to stay on the field. Tyron Smith landed only a one-year, $6.5 million deal in free agency a year ago, and that turned out to be a disappointment for the Jets.\n\nOn the other hand, there are more teams that need left tackles than viable options out there. Terron Armstead had a track record of struggling to stay healthy and landed a five-year, $75 million deal from the Dolphins just before his age-31 season. The Ravens just replaced three starters on their line a year ago, and while they have Roger Rosengarten locked in at right tackle, there's no clear left tackle of the future on their roster.\n\nGeneral manager Eric DeCosta has hinted at the possibility of moving Rosengarten to the blind side, but given that all of the second-round pick's starts in college came at right tackle, I would suspect that comment is more negotiating leverage with Stanley than anything else. The Ravens could also choose to let Stanley leave, bring back Mekari to solidify the interior and find a left tackle in April's draft.\n\nPotential candidates for release: TE Mark Andrews, S Marcus Williams. Williams is a lock to be released after losing his spot in the lineup. He already had agreed to reduce his 2025 base salary to $2.1 million, which is a tactic teams usually use before designating players as a post-June 1 release. (The only exception I know of is wideout Michael Thomas with the Saints.) Doing so would free up $2.6 million in cap space for the Ravens, although that move would leave $9.4 million in dead cap on the books for Williams in 2026.\n\nAndrews is entering the final year of his four-year, $56 million extension, and while I don't think the drop that ended their playoff loss to the Bills will matter much in Baltimore's thinking, he hasn't come close to matching the 1,361 yards he posted in his breakout 2021 campaign. He finished the season with 11 touchdowns but only 673 receiving yards across 17 games.\n\nThe three-time Pro Bowler averaged 2.2 yards per route run last season, which ranked third among tight ends, behind George Kittle and Trey McBride. I think it's more likely the Ravens choose to let Andrews play out the final year of his deal, which would amount to $11 million. Given Isaiah Likely's production (477 yards, six scores), though, they could consider moving on and using that money elsewhere.\n\nHouston Texans (4)\n\nProjected cap space: $2.6 million (25th) before Stefon Diggs's contract voids, adding $16.6 million in space\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: Edge Derek Barnett, WR Stefon Diggs, DL Foley Fatukasi, G Kendrick Green, LB Neville Hewitt, Edge Jerry Hughes, WR Diontae Johnson, S Eric Murray, CB Jeff Okudah, RB Dare Ogunbowale, LB Devin White, WR Robert Woods\n\nTop priority: Diggs. When the Texans traded a second-round pick for Diggs and voided the final four years of his deal as a motivational tactic, it seemed like they were going to either end up landing a big win or a big loss. In the end, it fell something closer to incomplete. Diggs averaged 62 receiving yards per game and 1.91 yards per route run this season, figures close to what the four-time Pro Bowler posted in his final season with the Bills.\n\nUnfortunately for all parties involved, Diggs tore his ACL in Week 8 and missed the remainder of the season. It's unclear whether he will be able to return in time for the start of the 2025 season, and as a 31-year-old with numbers down comfortably from his peak, my initial suspicion was that he probably isn't looking at a significant deal in free agency. Then again, Odell Beckham Jr. got a one-year, $15 million deal from the Ravens in 2023, and that was after missing an entire season with a torn ACL.\n\nThe Texans need to reenvision their offense after a disappointing performance on that side of the ball led to the firing of coordinator Bobby Slowik. They also have a hole at wide receiver behind Nico Collins after Tank Dell suffered a multiligament knee injury in December. A reunion with Diggs on a one-year deal in the Beckham range would make sense, but if he is able to land a multiyear guarantee elsewhere, Houston would probably need to bow out.\n\nPotential candidates for release: DT Denico Autry, OL Tytus Howard, G Shaq Mason. After the disaster that was their offensive line, the Texans have to give serious thought to making major changes up front. Howard wants to play right tackle, but the Texans have moved him to left guard each of the past two seasons, and they're likely to start 2024 second-round pick Blake Fisher at his natural position on the right side next season. Just $1.8 million of Howard's $16 million in compensation is guaranteed, so the 2019 first-rounder is a candidate to take a pay cut or get traded.\n\nAutry has been one of the league's most underrated players over the past few seasons, but he was suspended for the first six games of the season after violating the league's policy against performance-enhancing drugs. In an abbreviated debut season with the Texans, the 34-year-old had three sacks and six knockdowns in 10 games. None of the $9 million he's owed in 2025 is guaranteed, and Houston might regret its decision to sign him given what has happened since.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (5)\n\nProjected cap space: $64.9 million (sixth)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: C Bradley Bozeman, RB J.K. Dobbins, DT Poona Ford, DL Morgan Fox, CB Kristian Fulton, TE Hayden Hurst, Edge Khalil Mack, S Marcus Maye, S Elijah Molden, C Sam Mustipher, WR Joshua Palmer, LB Denzel Perryman, CB Asante Samuel Jr., P JK Scott, DT Teair Tart\n\nTop priority: Molden. There's not an obvious priority here, but there are several players the Chargers will want to bring back after turning over their roster and winning a playoff spot in Jim Harbaugh's first season with the team.\n\nMolden might be the best representative of that turnover. Acquired for a seventh-round pick from the Titans at the end of training camp, he was forced into the starting lineup early because of injuries, and he excelled. He spent time at cornerback and safety during his time in Tennessee, but the Chargers kept him out of the box and used him as one of their two deep safeties for most of the season, which freed up Derwin James to play closer to the line of scrimmage. Molden allowed a 62.6 passer rating in coverage before suffering a fractured fibula in December, which ended his season.\n\nThis could just as easily be Bozeman, who went from being cast off by the Panthers to serving as a valuable run-blocking center for L.A. Elsewhere, there's an entire valuable Chargers defensive tackle rotation hitting the market, as Ford and Tart made their presence known on a weekly basis for defensive coordinator Jesse Minter.\n\nThe biggest name is Mack, who confirmed last week he intends to continue his career. After a 17-sack season in 2023, the 33-year-old took a pay cut to stay with the Chargers, then racked up six sacks and 15 knockdowns over 616 snaps. Minter reduced Mack's role in the lineup, and while the former Defensive Player of the Year earned a Pro Bowl nod, second-year defender Tuli Tuipulotu had a case for playing better than the veteran. Mack is going to have suitors, and those teams might be able to offer more playing time.\n\nPotential candidates for release: Edge Joey Bosa. The situation with Mack could change if the Chargers decided to move on from the 2016 No. 3 pick. Bosa was drafted by a long-departed regime in San Diego, and while he quickly emerged as a superstar, we have seen him neither healthy nor productive for several seasons. He was limited to five games in 2022 and nine in 2023, and while he suited up for 14 games this season, he failed to play even 30% of the snaps four times. During the second half of the season, with Bosa playing the heavy end of a rotation, he racked up two sacks and eight hits.\n\nIn the second year of a restructured deal, his cap hit is a whopping $36.5 million. He's owed $25.4 million in compensation, about half of which comes as a roster bonus in mid-March, which puts a deadline on general manager Joe Hortiz's decision-making process. Cutting a 29-year-old who looked like he was on a Hall of Fame track three years ago has to be painful, but when his name is removed from the equation, he's a pass rusher who has 14 sacks while playing about one full season's worth of snaps (941) over the past three years.\n\nBosa won't be back at that number. The Chargers will either cut him or redo that deal to reduce the cap figure. After taking a $7 million pay cut last offseason to stay with the team, would he take another one in 2025?\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (6)\n\nProjected cap space: $43.3 million (14th)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: G James Daniels, QB Justin Fields, RB Najee Harris, CB Donte Jackson, WR Van Jefferson, S Damontae Kazee, OT Dan Moore Jr., LB Elandon Roberts, CB Cameron Sutton, WR Mike Williams, QB Russell Wilson\n\nNotable restricted free agents: RB Jaylen Warren\n\nTop priority: Wilson. On Monday, Steelers owner Art Rooney said he would prefer to bring back one of Wilson or Fields to serve as the team's starting quarterback in 2025. Given that Mike Tomlin & Co. clearly preferred Wilson to the younger, more mobile Fields when both passers were healthy, it stands to reason the organization's first choice would be re-signing the veteran.\n\nAs was the case in Denver a year ago, Wilson's numbers look better than the public perception of his performance. He averaged 7.4 yards per attempt, threw 16 touchdown passes against five picks and posted a 95.6 passer rating. The issue is that he turned only 33.3% of his passes into first downs and took sacks on just under 9% of his dropbacks. Total QBR, which factors those numbers in, ranked Wilson 22nd in the league, just between Geno Smith and Kirk Cousins.\n\nWilson will get a raise from the $1.2 million he earned last season, but it's tough to see him getting much more. There isn't a better landing spot for him as a starter, and while I'd argue the slide to end the season was more a product of facing stiff competition than the offense falling apart, it surely didn't endear him to other teams. Wilson's fit is as a safe pair of hands on a veteran team, and every other team hoping to compete for a title has higher ambitions for their quarterbacks than Pittsburgh.\n\nThe running back situation is also interesting. The Steelers declined Harris' fifth-year option after three years of steady, below-average production. They got more of the same this season, although he was slightly more efficient as a receiver and didn't fumble for the first time since his 2021 rookie campaign. He finished with minus-3 rush yards over expectation (RYOE) and averaged minus-30 RYOE over the four seasons of his rookie deal. There's value in a back who absorbs a heavy workload at slightly below league-average efficiency, but Pittsburgh has to be thoughtful about its ability to get that production elsewhere.\n\nIf the Steelers re-sign Harris, I wonder if there'll be another team interested in targeting Warren as a restricted free agent. The 26-year-old struggled through an injury-impacted season and has had trouble with fumbles, but he has been more explosive, efficient and versatile than Harris within the same offense over the past three seasons. The whole situation is reminiscent of Melvin Gordon and Austin Ekeler with the Chargers, where a first-round pick took touches away from a smaller, more talented back. The Steelers would need to offer Warren a $5.2 million salary for 2025 to receive any compensation if they declined to match a potential Warren offer.\n\nPotential candidates for release: LB Cole Holcomb, DL Larry Ogunjobi, Edge Preston Smith. The Steelers don't need to create cap space, but there are a few veterans on defense whose salaries aren't in line with their roles. Holcomb suffered a serious knee injury in December 2023 and missed all of the 2024 season, which was one of the reasons the Steelers signed Patrick Queen in free agency. Payton Wilson seems likely to start alongside Queen in 2025, and it wouldn't make sense to pay Holcomb the $6 million he's owed to serve as a backup linebacker.\n\nSmith was acquired in midseason from the Packers and played about 20 snaps per game with the Steelers, racking up two sacks and two quarterback knockdowns. He was a healthy scratch in Week 17 and then again in the playoff loss to the Ravens. With Watt, Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig ahead of him on the depth chart, there's no way he will be back at the $13.4 million figure he's owed, all of which is unguaranteed.\n\nDenver Broncos (7)\n\nProjected cap space: $39.8 million (16th)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: LB Cody Barton, FB Michael Burton, P Riley Dixon, WR Lil'Jordan Humphrey, DT D.J. Jones, QB Jarrett Stidham, LB Justin Strnad, RB Javonte Williams\n\nTop priority: Jones. The Broncos don't project to lose much this offseason. Jones wasn't an essential player for a very good Broncos defense this season, but he has been a useful run-plugging defensive tackle at his best. He got a deal in 2022 averaging $10 million per year to sign with the hope he might be able to do more as a pass rusher. Given that coordinator Vance Joseph reduced his snap share down to 40% while playing him just 15% of the time on third downs, it's clear the team sees him as a two-down tackle.\n\nOff-ball linebacker might feel like a bigger concern given that Barton and Strnad, who led the Broncos in snaps at the position, are both free agents. I wouldn't be shocked if one returned, but I don't get the sense that Denver believes either is irreplaceable. Alex Singleton should be coming back in 2025 after an early-season ACL tear, and there will inevitably be rumors that Sean Payton will be interested in making a move for a former Saints draftee in newly minted All-Pro linebacker Zack Baun.\n\nPotential candidates for release: LB Alex Singleton. Alternately, if the Broncos choose to bring back Barton and/or Strnad, there might not be a spot on the roster for Singleton. The 31-year-old is owed $5.6 million in the final year of his deal, none of which is guaranteed. At this point of his career, he is what he is: He's going to get in position to make a ton of tackles, miss a bunch of them and struggle in coverage. A solid run-defending linebacker at that cost is reasonable enough, but Denver might want to try to upgrade at that position this offseason.\n\nNFC playoff teams\n\nDetroit Lions (1)\n\nProjected cap space: $58 million (eighth)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: LB Derrick Barnes, QB Teddy Bridgewater, Edge John Cominsky, Edge Marcus Davenport, CB Carlton Davis, DB Ifeatu Melifonwu, DL Pat O'Connor, DL Levi Onwuzurike, WR Tim Patrick, OT/WR Dan Skipper, G Kevin Zeitler\n\nTop priority: Onwuzurike. It's getting tougher to be the Lions, but there's still plenty of wriggle room for general manager Brad Holmes to work with this offseason. Detroit got mixed results out of one-year deals with Davis, Davenport and Zeitler, as Davenport and Davis both ended up on injured reserve by the time the team got to the playoffs. Detroit should still be in the market for short-term additions at all three positions, but it's tough to imagine Davenport returning given his significant injury history.\n\nA more likely investment might be retaining another member of Holmes' first draft class. The Lions have already re-signed 2021 picks Penei Sewell, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Alim McNeill, but they might want to follow up by keeping Onwuzurike, too. Moved into an expanded role as a result of all the injuries up front, he racked up 13 knockdowns while playing just about every spot on the line outside of a true zero-technique nose. He missed all of 2022 after undergoing spinal fusion surgery, and the 26-year-old's medical outlook could color his market. There's a useful rotational pass rusher here, though, and the Lions still need secondary rushers behind Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nPotential candidates for release: QB Hendon Hooker. The Lions don't have anybody playing meaningful snaps who sticks out as a likely cap casualty. One potential candidate is the 27-year-old Hooker, who has thrown nine passes in two years. It seems telling that the Lions signed a quasi-retired Bridgewater at the end of the season and quickly pushed him ahead of Hooker on the depth chart, a move which ended up mattering when Jared Goff briefly left the playoff loss to the Commanders.\n\nHooker is owed only $1.3 million in unguaranteed money in 2025, but he's too inexperienced to be a reliable backup and too old to be a quarterback of the future, especially after Goff signed an extension last May.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (2)\n\nProjected cap space: $26 million (19th)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: LB Zack Baun, G Mekhi Becton, RB Kenneth Gainwell, Edge Brandon Graham, DB Avonte Maddox, CB Isaiah Rodgers, Edge Josh Sweat, DT Milton Williams\n\nTop priority: Sweat. That's not the longest list of notable free agents, but there are a handful of key players in the mix, including three contributors to Philadelphia's much-vaunted defensive line. Graham is either going to retire or return to Philadelphia, but Sweat and Williams are young and valuable. With Bryce Huff struggling badly in his first season with the Eagles, general manager Howie Roseman might be more inclined to bring back Sweat to play across from Nolan Smith Jr.\n\nLike everybody else on the Eagles' defense, Sweat slumped badly last season, but he was back up to eight sacks and 15 knockdowns this season. As an edge rusher in good health who doesn't turn 28 until March, he should have a big market. Williams is wildly underrated, but with Jalen Carter and Jordan Davis starting, the Eagles will probably lose the 2021 third-round pick to a team willing to pay him starter money in free agency.\n\nIn what would have been a surprise to Roseman himself before the season, though, there's a case to be made that the most pressing concern is bringing back Baun. An obvious first-team All-Pro pick and a runner-up on my Defensive Player of the Year ballot, Baun might have been an even better free agent signing than Saquon Barkley. He put up 3.5 sacks and 11 tackles for loss while leading the league in stops (88) and tackle percentage (14.6%).\n\nThe franchise tag for linebackers is based off edge rushers who are listed as linebackers as opposed to defensive ends, so the $27.1 million projection doesn't fit the market for off-ball linebackers such as Baun. The top of the market for inside linebackers is Roquan Smith's average annual salary of $20 million per year. I still can't imagine Philadelphia paying that much for a linebacker, even with Nakobe Dean recovering from a torn Achilles, but there was once a time when Roseman wouldn't have given serious thought to paying a running back $12.5 million per year, too.\n\nBecton could also be an interesting situation. Signed to a one-year, $2.8 million deal and kicked inside from tackle to guard, the 363-pounder has been superb in his debut season with the Eagles. Roseman has long established a willingness to pay offensive linemen, but he has handed out market-value deals on offense to his quarterback, running back, top two wide receivers, tight end, left tackle, left guard and right tackle. Center Cam Jurgens will probably get an extension this offseason. Roseman can't pay everyone on offense, can he?\n\nPotential candidates for release: CB James Bradberry, CB Darius Slay. After a disappointing 2023 season, the Eagles moved Bradberry to safety over the summer, only for him to suffer a lower-leg injury in training camp. Despite initial reports that the injury would cost him six to eight weeks, he hasn't returned to the roster. While he's owed only $2.1 million next year, the Eagles are likely to make the 31-year-old a post-June 1 release.\n\nSlay is still playing well enough to start, but with the emergence of rookies Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean, it would be a surprise if Philadelphia didn't want to start its two budding stars on a full-time basis in 2025, which would push DeJean ahead of the veteran on the outside in two-cornerback groupings. Slay has a $16.1 million bonus due before the start of the 2025 season, but I would expect Roseman to either redo Slay's deal or move on from him to avoid paying that amount. The 34-year-old Slay could choose to retire, which also would resolve the situation.\n\nMinnesota Vikings (3)\n\nProjected cap space: $63.9 million (seventh)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: RB Cam Akers, S Cam Bynum, DL Jonathan Bullard, QB Sam Darnold, CB Stephon Gilmore, CB Shaquill Griffin, RB Aaron Jones, DL Pat Jones, TE Johnny Mundt, CB Byron Murphy, G Dalton Risner, OT Cam Robinson, WR Trent Sherfield, DT Jerry Tillery, Edge Jihad Ward\n\nTop priority: Darnold. The Vikings have plenty of cap space, but that free agent list features a lot of players who were on the field regularly last season: four players who played at least 400 snaps on offense and seven who played 400 snaps on defense, including most of the starting secondary. General manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah has done an incredible job adding free agents to the roster, but one of the downsides of those deals is the majority of them don't last as long as rookie contracts.\n\nEverything starts with Darnold, who had a roller-coaster final month of the season. The frustrating end shouldn't completely overshadow the prior four months of solid-to-very-good quarterback play, but his performances against the Lions and Rams were exaggerated versions of his weaknesses during the season.\n\nMy colleague Ben Solak wrote a great piece on Darnold and the other quarterback dominoes that might follow, and I'd recommend checking that out for more detail on Darnold's market. I agree with Solak that Darnold's value should come in around $40 million per season, with Daniel Jones' deal with the Giants in 2023 as a potential comp for a quarterback with one year of success.\n\nWill that come from the Vikings? They can afford to retain him, but that seems less likely with 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy returning from the knee injury he suffered in August. There's a universe in which the Vikings could franchise tag and then trade Darnold, but that would have to happen almost immediately after the tag gets handed out. The Vikings almost certainly don't want to be tied up with a potential $41.3 million cap hold for Darnold, and if a multiyear market for him doesn't develop, the 27-year-old might just prefer to sign the tag.\n\nThe trade I've brought up as a market indicator dates back to 2009, when the Patriots placed the franchise tag on Matt Cassel and sent him (and Mike Vrabel) to the Chiefs for the No. 34 overall pick (which became safety Patrick Chung). If the Vikings can land a second-round pick for Darnold, that would be good value. But because they're likely signing free agents to replace their outgoing players, there's a reasonable chance they won't recoup a compensatory pick for him if he hits the open market.\n\nPotential candidates for release: C Garrett Bradbury. The veterans the Vikings have under contract are generally locked in or playing well enough to alleviate any concerns about being released. The one exception might be Bradbury, who has settled in as a low-end starter at center. At the same time, his $5.3 million compensation for 2025 isn't outlandish for a veteran in that range. If the Vikings want to upgrade, his unguaranteed contract could be vulnerable, but it's more likely he's back as the Week 1 starter.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (4)\n\nProjected cap space: $23.8 million (20th)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: Edge Shaquil Barrett, G Ben Bredeson, LB K.J. Britt, LB Lavonte David, S Mike Edwards, Edge William Gholston, WR Chris Godwin, DT Greg Gaines, Edge Anthony Nelson, Edge Joe Tryon-Shoyinka\n\nTop priority: Godwin. Few players endured a more frustrating end to their season than Godwin, who suffered a dislocated ankle in garbage time of a Week 7 loss to the Ravens. Quandre Diggs, Allen Hurns and Laquon Treadwell returned from the same injury in recent years, but they also fractured their fibula in the process. It's unclear whether Godwin did the same when he suffered his injury and what his rehab might look like.\n\nBefore the ankle injury, the 28-year-old was on pace for 121 catches, 1,399 yards and 12 touchdowns, which would have been his best season since 2019. After he went out, the Bucs used tight end Cade Otton as a slot receiver and got more production from rookie receiver Jalen McMillan, but they could bring back Godwin and play him alongside McMillan and Mike Evans in three-wide sets.\n\nIs that enough to justify resigning Godwin? There's going to be a market for his services, especially with two former Bucs offensive coordinators needing better receivers as coaches for the Jaguars and Panthers. Godwin's medicals will determine whether he's looking at a one-year deal or a multi-season guarantee, but the Bucs might have to use the money they had committed to him to replenish their defense. Both of their starting linebackers and several members of their pass-rush rotation are also hitting free agency.\n\nPotential candidates for release: CB Jamel Dean. The Bucs have six players with cap holds over $5 million on their 2025 roster. The only one in danger of being released is Dean, though that's more a product of injuries than subpar play. He has yet to play a full season as a pro, and he has missed nine full games and significant portions of five more over the past two years because of injuries.\n\nHe is a solid corner in a defense with a blitz rate that puts its corners in difficult situations on a regular basis, which will play in his favor, but the 28-year-old's $13 million compensation is unguaranteed. The Bucs might try to play hardball and ask him to take a pay cut to return.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (5)\n\nProjected cap space: $41.1 million (15th)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: WR Tutu Atwell, QB Jimmy Garoppolo, DL Michael Hoecht, OT Alaric Jackson, S John Johnson, OT Joe Noteboom, LB Troy Reeder, WR Demarcus Robinson, LB Christian Rozeboom, CB Ahkello Witherspoon\n\nTop priority: Jackson. Replacing a legend is tough. The Rams got more than they could have ever expected when they signed Andrew Whitworth as a free agent in 2017, but it hasn't been quite as easy to replace the retired left tackle. Noteboom got first crack at the role in 2021, but he hasn't been the same caliber of player after tearing an Achilles in 2022. (He has been an injury fill-in and swing tackle since.)\n\nJackson has been the full-time starter the past two seasons outside of a two-game suspension for violating the league's personal conduct policy. According to NFL Next Gen Stats, he allowed just two sacks in 2024 while blocking one-on-one 82% of the time, rates that were both above the league average. On the other hand, he allowed pressures 9% of the time and 10 quick quarterback pressures, which was closer to league average for a left tackle.\n\nJackson is an excellent athlete, and there aren't many tackles hitting free agency in their mid-20s with several years of experience at the most important position on the line. There also isn't the sort of chatter around Jackson as an upper-echelon left tackle in NFL circles that there is for other players at the position.\n\nThen again, what can the Rams do? They're trying to win now with quarterback Matthew Stafford, and there's no other left tackle ready to step in for Jackson. Sean McVay & Co. deserve credit for molding Jackson from an unrestricted free agent into a starter, but it's tough to ask them to do that again at such a critical position in the twilight of Stafford's career. The $25.6 million franchise tag seems too rich for Jackson, but it might be a realistic option for L.A. to buy itself some time to get another look at him in 2025.\n\nPotential candidates for release: TE Tyler Higbee, G Jonah Jackson, WR Cooper Kupp, QB Matthew Stafford\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here. Let's start with the obvious one: The only reason the Rams would \"release\" Stafford would be if he retired. If that happens, they would ask him to reduce his $23 million base salary to the league minimum and carry him on the roster through June 1, at which point he would officially file retirement paperwork. The Rams would pay him a $4 million bonus in March, but they would spread the $50 million in dead money for his deal over the next two seasons, freeing up $23 million on next season's cap, though the money wouldn't be available until June.\n\nKupp wants to continue playing, but it probably won't be with the Rams unless he takes a pay cut. The organization tried to trade him before the deadline and didn't find any takers. The former Offensive Player of the Year has clearly taken a step back from being the No. 1A wideout alongside Puka Nacua. He averaged a solid 2.1 yards per route run this season, but from Dec. 1 onward, that fell to a below-average 1.4.\n\nKupp is still an excellent blocker and useful player, but he's 32 and has repeatedly battled injuries since a high ankle sprain in 2022. Crucially, he's owed $20 million in 2025, $7.5 million of which is already guaranteed as a bonus March 15 (the remaining $12.5 million base salary is not). The Rams moved on from Todd Gurley in 2020 and paid him a $7.5 million bonus to avoid triggering any future guarantees on his deal, which they could do with Kupp as well.\n\nL.A. could also try to find a trade partner for Kupp, but it's tough to see any team paying him $20 million next season. Reducing that base salary to $1.5 million and adding incentives would make sense for everyone involved, but if the two sides can't come to an agreement, his eight-year career with the Rams would be over.\n\nJonah Jackson's situation might be even more difficult to resolve. After the Rams signed the former Lions guard to a three-year, $51 million deal last offseason, he got injured and then lost his starting job. While the Rams could start over and find a role for him in 2025, they seem content on the interior with Steve Avila and Kevin Dotson at guard and Beaux Limmer playing center.\n\nLike Kupp, Jackson has a guaranteed roster bonus in 2025 ($8.5 million). He's also owed a $9 million base salary. The Rams would likely be thrilled to get out of all of those obligations, but that doesn't seem likely, even with a spike in the guard market. It's more plausible they could find a team to take on his salary. As was the case with Allen Robinson in 2023, though, they might need to eat some money to get a deal done.\n\nWashington Commanders (6)\n\nProjected cap space: $91 million (third)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: TE John Bates, WR Dyami Brown, WR Noah Brown, S Jeremy Chinn, Edge Dante Fowler Jr., TE Zach Ertz, CB Noah Igbinoghene, OT Cornelius Lucas, QB Marcus Mariota, CB Benjamin St-Juste, LB Bobby Wagner, P Tress Way, WR Olamide Zaccheaus\n\nTop priority: Fowler. It's good to be the Commanders considering how much cap space they have to build around Jayden Daniels. There's a lot of work to be done, though. Ertz, Igbinoghene and Chinn turned out to be great one-year signings by general manager Adam Peters, but after exceeding expectations, they're all going to rightfully want more money this time around.\n\nThe most productive one-year signing had to be Fowler. Signed for $3.3 million after spending the past two seasons with coach Dan Quinn in Dallas, he had the best season we've seen from the 2015 No. 3 pick in years. He racked up 10.5 sacks and forced two fumbles. The only regulars in the league with higher sack rates on a per-rush basis were Trey Hendrickson and Nik Bonitto.\n\nThe Commanders have to be careful, as Fowler is 30 years old. Those 10.5 sacks came on just 12 quarterback knockdowns, an unsustainable ratio and one out of line with his career to this point. His 11.5-sack 2019 season led the Falcons to give him a significant deal in free agency, and he responded with 7.5 sacks combined over the next two seasons. It's tough to expect the same results, but he has clearly earned another opportunity to start for Washington in 2025.\n\nPeters will also have to decide how ambitious he wants to be in adding playmakers for Daniels. Brian Robinson and Austin Ekeler will return at running back, and the Commanders will expect more out of Day 2 picks Ben Sinnott and Luke McCaffrey at receiver next season, but the only player assured of being an every-down playmaker is Terry McLaurin. Brown and Zaccheaus found meaningful niches in Washington's rotation and could come back as a third or fourth wideout option, but the Commanders will probably want to swing higher for starters this offseason.\n\nPotential candidates for release: OT Andrew Wylie. It would be a major surprise if the Commanders moved on from defensive tackle Jonathan Allen or recently acquired cornerback Marshon Lattimore, but both players have no guaranteed money left on their respective deals and missed significant time with injuries in 2024. It wouldn't make much sense for them to trade three picks for Lattimore and then cut him the following offseason, but we've seen sudden changes of heart like that occur with Julio Jones in Tennessee and Mohamed Sanu in New England. Lattimore never seemed to be healthy after joining Washington and didn't play well when he was on the field.\n\nA more realistic candidate is Wylie. He was fine at right tackle this season, but he was acquired by the former regime, and the Commanders might want to target a long-term solution on the right side to protect Daniels. Even if they did want to go after a free agent upgrade, they could afford to keep Wylie's $7.8 million salary and bonus on the books as a swing tackle.\n\nGreen Bay Packers (7)\n\nProjected cap space: $44 million (13th)\n\nNotable unrestricted free agents: RB AJ Dillon, LB Isaiah McDuffie, K Brandon McManus, C Josh Myers, CB Eric Stokes, LB Eric Wilson\n\nTop priority: Myers. The youngest team in the league is returning the vast majority of its starters from a year ago. The one position in which the Packers are losing two starters is linebacker, but their 2025 starters are already on the roster in Quay Walker and budding star Edgerrin Cooper. Stokes is a 2021 first-round pick for whom the team held high hopes, but injuries slowed his development, and he has allowed a 118.5 passer rating in coverage over the past three seasons.\n\nUnless you want me to pick a kicker, that leaves Myers, who was a Week 1 starter as a rookie and has been in the pivot when healthy over the ensuing four seasons. The Packers hinted they might move him out of the starting lineup and kick Zach Tom inside last offseason, but when first-round pick Jordan Morgan was limited to 186 snaps by a nagging shoulder injury, they kept Tom outside for most of the season.\n\nGeneral manager Brian Gutekunst can afford to re-sign Myers, and the Packers just let a starting interior lineman leave in free agency last offseason when Jon Runyan joined the Giants. If they think Morgan's ready to start on a full-time basis in 2025, though, it will likely come at the expense of Myers' spot in the lineup. Realistically, they might be more focused on re-signing McManus after he went 20-of-21 on field goals during the regular season.\n\nPotential candidates for release: CB Jaire Alexander. The more difficult decision for Green Bay will come at cornerback, where Alexander's future with the organization is uncertain. The 2018 first-round pick has generally produced at a high level when he has been on the field, but getting him there has been a challenge. He has missed 34 games over the past four years with various injuries, including the second half of 2024 with a knee injury.\n\nAlexander is owed nearly $17.2 million in cash in 2025, none of which is guaranteed. There also hasn't been a significant on/off split for the Packers with him over the past four season by expected points added (EPA) per play. They can afford to pay him in the hopes that they see him on the field regularly, but are they better off spending that money on players who are more likely to suit up for a full 17-game season?",

    "raw_text": "Two weeks later in Nashville, Tennessee, Missouri trailed Iowa by 10 late in the third quarter, but Joshua Manning's short touchdown and a 51-yard field goal from Blake Craig tied the score. Then, Craig crushed a 56-yarder with 4:36 left to give Mizzou a lead that held up after a glorious fourth-and-short stop with 1:03 left.\n\nIn Phoenix, Rutgers gashed Kansas State's defense for five long drives and took a 34-17 lead with 8:57 left in the third quarter, but K-State went on a 27-7 run keyed by TD runs of 65 and 36 yards from Dylan Edwards. Rutgers stalled at midfield, and the Wildcats had Win No. 9.\n\nAnd in the most important bowl of the year, the Pop-Tarts Bowl in Orlando, Florida, Iowa State and Miami traded blows Hagler-Hearns style in a manic first half that ended with Miami leading 31-28. The second half turned into a slog thanks in part to Cam Ward's decision to play only one half for Miami. But ISU capped a 15-play, 84-yard TD drive with a 1-yard Rocco Becht plunge with 56 seconds left, and Drew Surges' interception capped the comeback win.\n\n93. Sept. 7: Pitt 28, Cincinnati 27\n\nPitt enjoyed a rousing 7-0 start to 2024. The less we focus on the Panthers' 0-6 finish, the better, but it looked like they wouldn't make it to 2-0 when they were down 27-6 late in the third quarter against former Big East rival Cincy. But Eli Holstein led touchdown drives of 75, 82 and 94 yards to bring the Panthers within 27-25, and after a late Cincinnati punt, Konata Mumpfield's 34-yard catch set up Ben Sauls' game winner from 35 yards.\n\n92. Sept. 20: Stanford 26, Syracuse 24\n\nStanford's first ACC win was a wild one. The Cardinal visited Syracuse on a Friday night and took a 10-point lead after a 71-yard Mitch Leigber pick-six. Syracuse stormed back to take a 24-23 lead, but Ashton Daniels linked up with Elic Ayomanor for 27 yards to set up Emmet Kenney's 39-yard winning field goal.\n\n91. Sept. 28: Duke 21, North Carolina 20\n\nAfter a 70-50 loss to James Madison, it was fair to guess that UNC would either play its best or worst game in response. The Tar Heels did both. First, they bolted to a 20-0 lead. Then they allowed Duke to charge back and take a 21-20 lead with 5:42 remaining. Tre Freeman's interception sealed a ferocious comeback win for Duke.\n\n90. Nov. 23: Cal 24, Stanford 21\n\nCal became one of college football's main characters after a 3-0 start, but the Golden Bears were 5-5 and still needing one more win for bowl eligibility when Stanford visited for the first ACC edition of the Big Game. Stanford promptly took a 14-0 lead and still led 21-10 heading into the fourth quarter. But a pair of Fernando Mendoza-to-Jonathan Brady touchdowns gave the Bears their first lead with just 2:40 left, and a late stop sealed a thrilling win.\n\n89. Nov. 21: Georgia Tech 30, NC State 29\n\n88. Oct. 12: Georgia Tech 41, North Carolina 34\n\nOur tour of the ACC continues. Georgia Tech went unbeaten against the state of North Carolina in 2024 but needed heroics (and opponent breakdowns) to pull it off against North Carolina in Week 7 and NC State in Week 13. First, North Carolina erased a 10-point deficit in the last four minutes of regulation, only to let Jamal Haynes race up the middle for a 68-yard touchdown with 16 seconds left.\n\nThen, in a wild Thursday night affair, NC State turned a nine-point deficit into a 29-23 lead in the final seven minutes, only for Aaron Philo to score from 18 yards with 22 seconds left. NC State got close enough for Collin Smith to attempt a 58-yard field goal at the buzzer. It didn't miss by much.\n\n87. Nov. 16: Kansas 17, No. 6 BYU 13\n\nKansas, incredibly, lost five one-score games in 2024, but the Jayhawks finally scored a wild win in November and derailed BYU's Big 12 hopes. All things considered, was this the greatest -- or at least, most impactful -- pooch punt of all time?\n\n86. Nov. 9: No. 24 Missouri 30, Oklahoma 23\n\nWith Mizzou's Brady Cook out due to injury, backup Drew Pyne engineered a 16-9 lead for the Tigers midway through the fourth quarter. Then things got weird. OU quarterback Jackson Arnold caught an 18-yard touchdown pass, then Billy Bowman Jr. returned a fumble 43 yards to give the Sooners a 23-16 lead. But Pyne quickly engineered a 75-yard TD drive, capped by a TD pass to former Sooner Theo Wease Jr., and then it was Mizzou's turn to pull off a scoop-and-score: Zion Young gathered an Arnold fumble and took it 17 yards for the winning points with 19 seconds left.\n\n85. Oct. 12: Georgia Southern 24, Marshall 23\n\nWith eight minutes to go at Paulson Stadium in Statesboro, Georgia, Marshall led 23-3. But in front of an increasingly delirious crowd, the Eagles forced a safety, scored in nine plays, recovered a fumble, scored again, recovered another fumble, scored the go-ahead touchdown with a minute left, then picked off a pass to seal the ultimate smash-and-grab win. Marshall recovered to win the Sun Belt, but wow, did this one get away from the Thundering Herd.\n\n84. Oct. 31: Vanderbilt 34, Virginia Tech 27 (OT)\n\nDiego Pavia and Vanderbilt wasted no time showing their potential in 2024. In maybe the best game of an otherwise lackluster opening weekend, the Commodores hosted a Virginia Tech team with dark-horse ACC title hopes and bolted to a 17-3 lead before the Hokies knew the season started. Tech seemingly seized control thanks to a 17-0 run, but Pavia tied the score with an 8-yard TD pass to Sedrick Alexander, then scored the game winner in overtime.\n\n83. Dec. 23: Northern Illinois 28, Fresno State 20 (2OT) (Famous Idaho Potato Bowl)\n\n82. Dec. 26: Toledo 48, Pittsburgh 46 (6OT) (GameAbove Sports Bowl)\n\n81. Dec. 24: USF 41, San Jose State 39 (5OT) (Hawaii Bowl)\n\nThese three bowls gave us 12 quarters, 13 overtimes and 222 points.\n\nNIU capped just about the most memorable eight-win season imaginable by emptying the bag of tricks in Boise, Idaho. Freshman quarterback Josh Holst threw two touchdown passes, rushed for 65 yards and then caught the eventual game-winning 2-point conversion pass from freshman receiver George Dimopoulos, who had also just thrown a touchdown pass to Dane Pardridge. Fresno State's poor Dylan Lynch missed three field goals, including a potential 35-yard game winner at the buzzer in regulation, and NIU coach Thomas Hammock ended the year with what he called the \"best dump of my career.\"\n\nFans in Detroit got their money's worth in the GameAbove Sports Bowl, at least on a per-minute basis. Toledo and Pitt stretched this one more than 4\u00bd hours when Toledo erased a 10-point, fourth-quarter deficit, Pitt elected not to go for two points and the win at the end of the first overtime and, after seven consecutive successful 2-point conversions (and a couple of premature Toledo celebrations), the Rockets finally made a stop and celebrated an eighth win of the season.\n\nMeanwhile in Hawaii, USF and SJSU gave us a great Christmas Eve distraction. SJSU overcame an early 21-7 deficit to take a fourth-quarter lead before John Cannon's 41-yarder at the buzzer forced OT (after OT, after OT, after OT). Eventually, SJSU also paid for not going for two points and the win in the first OT. After both teams failed their 2-pointers in OT4, Bryce Archie's successful strike to Keshaun Singleton gave the game to USF.\n\n80. Oct. 19: Iowa State 38, UCF 35\n\n79. Nov. 2: Texas Tech 23, No. 11 Iowa State 22\n\nIowa State started 7-0 for the first time since 1938, and both the seventh win and the first loss were incredible. UCF took a 28-14 lead in Ames, Iowa, in Week 8 thanks to a pick-six and runs of 67 and 80 yards. The Knights still led by eight early in the fourth quarter, but Rocco Becht's 1-yard plunge with 30 seconds left capped the comeback.\n\nISU almost did it again in the next game. Texas Tech led for more than 40 minutes until ISU charged back to take a 22-17 lead with 2:11 remaining. But the Cyclones scored too soon. Behren Morton completed a fourth-and-7 pass to Josh Kelly to set up Tahj Brooks' game winner with 20 seconds remaining.\n\n78. Nov. 16: New Mexico 38, No. 18 Washington State 35\n\n77. Sept. 20: Washington State 54, SJSU 52 (2OT)\n\n76. Sept. 14: Washington State 24, Washington 19\n\nWashington State didn't lack for dramatics this season. A stirring 8-1 start folded after four straight late losses, but the Cougars maximized the entertainment dollar.\n\nThe season took a turn with New Mexico's late track meet win. The Cougars led 28-14 at halftime but couldn't shake Devon Dampier and the Lobos. Dampier's second touchdown run triggered a comeback that his third touchdown run, with 21 seconds remaining, completed.\n\nThere were plenty of good vibes earlier in the season in Pullman, Washington, however. In Week 4, San Jose State outscored the Cougars 21-0 to take a 14-point lead, but Wazzu stormed back with three straight TDs. TreyShun Hurry scored to give the Spartans the lead with 26 seconds left, but Dean Janikowski's 52-yard field goal sent the game to OT where, after both teams threw interceptions on their first possessions, Wazzu prevailed in the second.\n\nThe week before was even more emotional. In the first Apple Cup after Washington left Wazzu and the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, the Cougars stuffed a late fourth-and-goal attempt, and head coach Jake Dickert got emotional.\n\n75. Aug. 24: SMU 29, Nevada 24\n\n74. Aug. 24: Georgia Tech 24, No. 10 Florida State 21\n\nWeek 0 classics are fun: They're wild, and we have no idea what they'll mean. Before SMU made a run to the ACC championship game and College Football Playoff, the Mustangs had to claw back against a feisty Nevada team. The Wolf Pack led 24-13 with nine minutes left, but Brashard Smith's touchdown, a 2-point conversion and a quick safety made it 24-23. A beautiful 34-yard Preston Stone lob to RJ Maryland with 1:18 left gave them their first lead.\n\nHours earlier (and thousands of miles away in Dublin, Ireland), Georgia Tech kick-started Florida State's 2024 collapse with a heaping dose of Jamal Haynes and Haynes King. The Yellow Jackets scored on three drives of longer than six minutes, and Aidan Birr's 44-yard field goal at the buzzer gave Tech a shocking win that soon wouldn't feel shocking.\n\n73. Sept. 7: Iowa State 20, No. 21 Iowa 19\n\nThe first half of this reliably tight rivalry was all Iowa. The Hawkeyes got a TD run from Kaleb Johnson and led 13-0 at halftime. But ISU surged in the second half, gaining more than 250 yards, scoring twice in the third quarter and getting 46- and 54-yard field goals from Kyle Konrardy in the fourth. The second came with just five seconds left.\n\n72. Sept. 28: Sam Houston 40, Texas State 39\n\nAfter an 0-8 start to begin its life in the FBS, SHSU won three of its past four in 2023, then five of its first six to earn 10 wins in 2024. This was the wildest win of the bunch. TXST scored 22 points in the first 13 minutes and led 39-21 with 20 minutes left, but two scores brought the Bearkats to within 39-34, and two Christian Pavon field goals, the second with just six seconds left, finished the wild in-state win.\n\n71. Sept. 20: No. 24 Illinois 31, No. 22 Nebraska 24 (OT)\n\nSome games are destined for overtime. Neither team led by more than a TD, and when Nebraska had a chance to go ahead late, Dylan Raiola missed a wide-open Luke Lindenmeyer in the end zone, then John Hohl missed a 39-yard field goal. Illinois took advantage of the extra chance. The Illini scored on the second play of OT, then sacked Raiola three times in four plays to seal the win.\n\nThe best of the smaller school season\n\n70. Sept. 28: No. 19 College of Idaho 45, No. 10 Montana Tech 37\n\nWe start the smaller school portion of the list with Coyotes over Orediggers! One of college football's best mascot matchups was wild in 2024: In a 44-point fourth quarter in NAIA, College of Idaho flipped a 31-19 deficit into a 37-31 lead with 1:53 remaining. Montana Tech drove 85 yards in less than a minute to tie the score, but Tanner Steele blocked the PAT to force overtime, then the Coyotes sealed a homecoming win thanks to a short touchdown and Dee'Shon Swafford's interception.\n\n69. Oct. 12: Dartmouth 44, Yale 43\n\nWith eight minutes left in a game that had major Ivy League title stakes, Yale led 37-16. But Dartmouth scored, recovered an onside kick and scored again to make it 37-30 with 6:34 left. Yale's Nick Conforti missed a game-clinching field goal, and Grayson Saunier raced 32 yards to tie the score. Conforti missed a long field goal at the buzzer, and after the teams traded TDs in overtime, the Bulldogs failed on what would have been the game-winning 2-pointer.\n\n68. Aug. 31: No. 19 Benedictine 48, No. 10 Morningside 45\n\nBenedictine eventually made a run to the NAIA semifinals, and this Week 1 thriller was a mission statement of sorts. The Ravens bolted to a 28-3 road lead barely 15 minutes into the game, but Morningside, an NAIA blueblood, went on a 42-13 run to take the lead with 3:31 remaining. We were only getting started. Jacob Gathright's 29-yard touchdown catch pushed Benedictine back in front with 55 seconds left, and while Morningside quickly drove the length of the field, Lennx Brown was stuffed at the goal line as time expired.\n\n67. Oct. 26: Youngstown State 41, No. 7 North Dakota 40 (OT)\n\nBack and forth, back and forth: This game had nine lead changes, and neither team led by more than seven. Andrew Lastovka's 35-yard field goal forced overtime for YSU, and the Penguins scored first in OT. North Dakota responded with a Simon Romfo-to-Bo Belquist TD, UND went for two points and the win but was denied.\n\n66. Sept. 28: Drake 30, San Diego 28\n\nDrake won the Pioneer League by one game over San Diego, and the Bulldogs had to ride the win probability roller coaster to take the title.\n\nSan Diego went on a 19-0 run to take a 28-27 lead with 1:55 left, but Shane Dunning nailed a 48-yard field goal at the buzzer to save a chaotic win and eventually secure a conference title.\n\n65. Nov. 23: Ashland 40, No. 6 Charleston 38\n\nAt the Division II level, we got this big early-playoff upset. Ashland took a sudden lead with late touchdowns of 45 and 77 yards, but Yves Bosmans' 44-yard touchdown catch gave unbeaten Charleston a 38-37 advantage with just 1:13 left. Upset bid quashed? Not so much! Despite a botched PAT earlier in the quarter, Ashland advanced with a 37-yard A.J. Rhodes field goal as time expired.\n\n64. Dec. 7: No. 6 Susquehanna 41, No. 4 Saint John's 38\n\nWith three tight wins, Susquehanna made a stirring run to the Division III semifinals in 2024, and this one was probably the most memorable of the bunch. The River Hawks went on a 31-7 run to turn a 10-point deficit into a 14-point lead midway through the fourth quarter before Aaron Syverson's fourth and fifth TD passes of the day tied the score for the Johnnies. But a pair of third-down completions from Josh Ehrlich to Michael Robbins set up Dominic Bourgeois' 37-yard field goal at the buzzer. Susquehanna pulled the road upset.\n\n63. Oct. 5: No. 24 Wisconsin-Platteville 30, No. 3 Wisconsin-La Crosse 27 (OT)\n\n62. Oct. 12: Wisconsin-Stout 29, No. 8 Wisconsin-Whitewater 27\n\n61. Oct. 19: No. 11 Wisconsin-River Falls 40, Wisconsin-Stout 37 (OT)\n\n60. Nov. 2: No. 21 Wisconsin-La Crosse 33, Wisconsin-Stout 31\n\nThe WIAC gave us one of the best title races in college football. Every week was a tight finish and plot twist. I somehow limited myself to four games from this race.\n\nIn Week 6, UW-Platteville trailed 24-9 with seven minutes left but charged back with a pair of long Michael Priami touchdown passes -- 42 yards to Brandt Stare and 40 to Carter Olsen. And after catching two touchdown passes, it was time for Stare to throw the game winner.\n\nThis became the most important result in the race because Platteville held off La Crosse by one game.\n\nIn Week 7, UW-Stout ended a 21-game losing streak to mighty UW-Whitewater. The Blue Devils led 23-20 after a wild first half, but the second half was a war of attrition. Luke Cool's fourth field goal gave Stout a 29-20 lead early in the fourth quarter, and when UWW got the ball back with a chance to win late, Braxton Munnikhuysen came up with a huge sack, and the Warhawks turned the ball over on downs.\n\nIn Week 8, UW-Stout nearly pulled off another stunner. The Blue Devils led 27-6 at halftime, but UWRF tied the score with a pick-six early in the fourth quarter, tied it again late and finally sealed a comeback win with Cade Fitzgerald's 2-yard sneak in overtime.\n\nIn Week 10, Stout lost another heartbreaker. The lead changed hands four times in four fourth-quarter scores, but Maddox Pratt's 25-yard field goal gave the Eagles the lead, and Carver Cram picked off a Hail Mary on the final play.\n\n59. Nov. 23: No. 4 South Dakota 29, No. 1 NDSU 28\n\nIn the last week of FCS' regular season, South Dakota proved itself before a nice run to the semifinals. The Coyotes took a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter before the prototypical NDSU surge gave the Bison a 28-17 advantage with 4:10 left. But USD didn't flinch: Aidan Bouman hit Jack Martens for a 40-yard touchdown, USD forced a punt with 1:20 left and Bouman found a shockingly open Javion Phelps for a 25-yard score for the win with just 12 seconds remaining.\n\n58. Jan. 6: No. 2 North Dakota State 35, No. 1 Montana State 32\n\n57. Dec. 21: No. 2 North Dakota State 28, No. 3 South Dakota State 21\n\nA lot of NDSU's national title runs have unfolded in rather dominant (and unmemorable) fashion. But the Bison had to work for Title No. 10. First, they had to defeat Dakota Marker rival (and two-time defending national champion) SDSU for the second time in about two months. In a back-and-forth contest, the teams traded TDs early in the fourth quarter before Bryce Lance continued his stellar playoff performance.\n\nLance's outrageous one-handed catch, his third score of the day, gave the Bison a late lead, and they clinched the win with a fourth-down sack of SDSU's Mark Gronowski with 1:16 left.\n\nThat win earned them a trip to Frisco, Texas, where the regular season's best team, Montana State, awaited. Cam Miller's 64-yard, up-the-middle score gave NDSU an early 14-0 lead, and the Bison expanded it to 21-3 at halftime with another Lance TD. But MSU stormed back, as expected. The Bobcats closed the gap to three points on three occasions before Kaedin Steindorf did something awfully unique: A walk-off punt! MSU went for the block with seven seconds left but couldn't get there, Steindorf's effort rolled to a stop, and NDSU celebrated.\n\n56. Sept. 14: No. 2 North Dakota State 38, ETSU 35\n\nIt took NDSU a little while to get rolling in 2024, and an early loss to ETSU might have had lasting repercussions on the Bison's playoff seeding. But despite trailing 35-23 with under two minutes left, they saved themselves with a 3-yard TK Marshall run, an onside kick recovery (Kaedin Steindorf's second-most important kick of the season) and Cam Miller's game-winning 11-yard run. Logan Kopp's interception with 17 seconds remaining sealed the deal.\n\n55. Nov. 2: No. 12 Mid America Nazarene 48, No. 7 Benedictine 47\n\nThe first 52 minutes of this one had already been pretty wild, with four lead changes and neither team leading by more than a touchdown. But the last eight minutes were particularly memorable. MNU scored, recovered a chip-shot kickoff, and scored for a second time in 58 seconds to turn a four-point deficit into a 10-point lead. But Benedictine, an eventual NAIA semifinalist, tied the score with 1:53 left. Adrian Parsons' 17-yard TD strike to Gaven Krans with 19 seconds left appeared to be MNU's game winner, but JaShawn Todd returned the ensuing kickoff 79 yards for a score. The Ravens went for two points and the win but they came up short.\n\n54. Nov. 30: No. 11 Slippery Rock 25, No. 3 Kutztown 24\n\nKutztown had one of Division II's best defenses in 2024, but on three occasions, the Bears needed a stop that never came. Slippery Rock forced overtime with a late score and scored again on a 28-yard Brayden Long-to-Logan Ramper strike on third-and-13 in OT. The Rock went for two points and the win by calling the hook and ladder. Nobody stops the hook and ladder!\n\n53. Oct. 19: No. 11 Central Oklahoma 64, Northeastern State 57\n\nMaybe the wildest, turn-your-brain-off popcorn flick of the 2024 season. Northeastern State took a 40-14 lead in the final minute of the first half, but UCO went on a 29-3 run to tie the score barely 10 minutes later. NSU went back up by 14, then UCO scored three touchdowns in the final 12 minutes. A late stop clinched the win for the Bronchos after 1,153 yards and eight total turnovers.\n\n52. Dec. 14: No. 1 Keiser 42, No. 9 Benedictine 38\n\nBenedictine lost only three games this season, but two of them were wild enough to make this list. The Ravens overcame an early deficit with a mid-game 25-0 burst against the defending NAIA national champs. But down 17, Keiser played a perfect final seven minutes. The Seahawks scored to make it 38-28, forced a three-and-out, drove 84 yards in two minutes to make it 38-35, forced another three-and-out and drove 75 yards in just 30 seconds. Shea Spencer's 25-yard TD pass to Elisha Edwards sent Keiser back to the title game (where they fell to Grand View).\n\n51. Oct. 31: Southern Nazarene 18, No. 3 Ouachita Baptist 17\n\nThe biggest upset of the 2024 season and one of the biggest of all time. Ouachita Baptist was 8-0 and coming off a huge upset of rival (and defending Division II champion) Harding. Southern Nazarene, meanwhile, was 0-8 and lost to Harding 59-0 earlier in the season. My SP+ rankings projected OBU as a 45.9-point favorite. Instead ...\n\nAfter the SNU defense made stop after stop, the Storm drove 72 yards in nine plays to score the game-winning touchdown (Bryson Evans to Dalen Smith) with 24 seconds left.\n\n50. Nov. 30: Duke 23, Wake Forest 17\n\nHow did Jordan Moore get this wide open on the last play of the game?\n\n49. Sept. 14: UCF 35, TCU 34\n\nThe winning team overcomes a three-touchdown, second-half deficit and scores the game winner with 36 seconds left in a game that features almost 1,000 total yards and a 400-yard passing performance from the losing quarterback? Yep, that's what you're looking for from a UCF-TCU game.\n\n48. Oct. 19: Maryland 29, USC 28\n\nDid it make sense that Maryland and USC were playing in mid-October? Absolutely not. Was it a dynamite game anyway? Absolutely. USC took a 14-point lead late in the first half and still led by six with two minutes left, but Donnell Brown blocked what would have been a game-clinching 41-yard field goal. A 5-yard run from Billy Edwards Jr. gave the Terps a surprising lead with 53 seconds left, and USC's last-gasp drive fell just short of field goal range.\n\n47. Oct. 19: Eastern Michigan 38, Central Michigan 34\n\n46. Nov. 2: Toledo 29, Eastern Michigan 28\n\nEMU might have gone 5-7 in 2024, but the Eagles did so in the most memorable way. They beat Jacksonville State in a double-overtime thriller that nearly made this list, and then they split two classics in a three-week span. First, they overcame an 18-point deficit to CMU with 11 minutes left. Two long Cole Snyder-to-Terry Lockett Jr. touchdown passes, and then Snyder sneaked in from the 1 with under two minutes left. A late stop sealed the win.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Eagles blew a 12-point lead to Toledo but nearly won thanks to Hail! Mary! MACtion!\n\nGoing for two points and the win after a Hail Mary made perfect sense, but the 2-point pass fell incomplete. Oof.\n\n45. Oct. 5: Arkansas 19, No. 4 Tennessee 14\n\nIt wasn't even the biggest unranked-over-top-five upset of the day in the SEC (hello, Bama-Vandy), and it didn't knock Tennessee out of the CFP, but it was still a thriller. Arkansas' defense played its best game of the season, and despite some early blown opportunities, the Razorbacks trailed just 14-10 heading into the fourth quarter. When quarterback Taylen Green went down due to injury, backup Malachi Singleton led a late go-ahead drive, the Hogs' D made one last stop and Arkansas celebrated a huge upset.\n\n44. Oct. 19: No. 19 Missouri 21, Auburn 17\n\nIt will be known in Columbia, Missouri, as the Brady Cook Game. Missouri's senior quarterback left his final homecoming game because of an ankle injury, and Auburn took a 17-3 lead early in the third quarter after a muffed punt return. But Cook returned from the hospital and led a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown drives. Jamal Roberts' 4-yard touchdown with 46 seconds left capped a game-winning 17-play, 95-yard drive and moved Mizzou to 6-1.\n\n43. Nov. 23: Oregon State 41, Washington State 38\n\nA 4-1 start turned into a dire, injury-plagued 5-7 finish for Oregon State in its first season following 2023's Pac-12 divorce. But the Beavers did win the de facto conference championship by scoring 10 points in the last three minutes against Wazzu. Ben Gulbranson and Darrius Clemons connected for a 4-yard touchdown to tie the score with 2:45 left, and after a Cougars fumble near midfield, Everett Hayes bombed in a 55-yard field goal with 20 seconds left.\n\n42. Oct. 4: Syracuse 44, No. 25 UNLV 41 (OT)\n\nOne of the highlights of Week 6 came on a Friday night with this ridiculous game of runs: 14-0 Syracuse, then 21-0 UNLV, then 17-0 Syracuse, then 17-0 UNLV. Syracuse forced overtime with a Jackson Meeks touchdown in the closing seconds, and after a UNLV field goal in the extra period, LeQuint Allen sealed the deal with a 1-yard plunge. It was a slight upset, but it felt less like one when Syracuse went on to finish 10-3.\n\n41. Oct. 12: No. 13 LSU 29, No. 9 Ole Miss 26\n\nWeek 7 might have been the best week of the season. It landed 10 games on this list, including this classic in Death Valley. LSU didn't lead for even one second of regulation, but Ole Miss couldn't ever score the knockout blow. In just two plays -- a 23-yard TD pass from Garrett Nussmeier to Aaron Anderson with 27 seconds left and a 25-yard OT strike from Nussmeier to Kyren Lacy -- the Tigers stole the win.\n\n40. Oct. 23: Kennesaw State 27, Liberty 24\n\n39. Nov. 9: UTEP 43, Kennesaw State 35 (2OT)\n\n38. Nov. 9: Jacksonville State 44, Louisiana Tech 37 (OT)\n\nConference USA carried its weight in the drama department this season, kicking into overdrive in Week 9 when Kennesaw State chose the best possible moment to score its first FBS win. A 13-3 run gave the Owls a shocking, late 27-17 lead over unbeaten Liberty, and after KSU fans rushed the field a second too soon and had to be cleared, they rushed the field a second time when the victory was finally sealed.\n\nTwo weeks later, KSU nearly won an even wilder game. UTEP's Buzz Flabiano missed a pair of potential winning field goal attempts in the final minute, but the Miners eventually prevailed when Skyler Locklear and Kenny Odom connected for a pair of overtime touchdowns and KSU could match only one of them.\n\nBut JSU-Tech was the CUSA game of the year. Jax State rolled out to an easy 21-7 lead early, but the Bulldogs' defense came alive and Tech went on a 23-0 run to take a two-score lead in the fourth quarter. But we were only getting started. It was 37-31 Tech when, on the final play of regulation, JSU completed a shockingly easy, 49-yard Hail Mary from Tyler Huff to Cam Vaughn. So ... ballgame, right? Nope! JSU missed the PAT. And then won in OT anyway.\n\n37. Sept. 14: No. 16 LSU 36, South Carolina 33\n\n36. Oct. 12: No. 7 Alabama 27, South Carolina 25\n\n35. Nov. 30: No. 15 South Carolina 17, No. 12 Clemson 14\n\n34. Nov. 16: No. 21 South Carolina 34, No. 23 Missouri 30\n\nSouth Carolina games were just so dramatic in 2024, enough so that the Gamecocks landed five games (and, unfortunately, only two wins) in the top 37.\n\nWe weren't sure how good the Gamecocks were back in Week 3, but they played the ultimate game of runs against LSU. They bolted to a 17-0 lead just 20 minutes in, but a 29-7 Tigers run gave the visitors a five-point lead. We weren't done. A pair of South Carolina scores made it 33-29 Gamecocks until Kyren Lacy's beautiful fourth-down catch set up Josh Williams' game winner and Alex Herrera missed a 49-yard field attempt at the buzzer.\n\nA few weeks later, South Carolina nearly handed Alabama its second straight loss after the Tide's shocker against Vandy. Bama held an easy 14-0 lead late in the first half in Tuscaloosa, but 19 points in 11 minutes gave the Gamecocks a sudden and shocking lead. A 34-yard Jalen Milroe-to-Germie Bernard score made it 27-19 Bama with 1:54 left, but SC bolted right back down the field, scored on LaNorris Sellers' 31-yard TD to Nyck Harbor with 43 seconds left ... and failed on the two-point conversion.\n\nLate in the season, the Gamecocks started winning the dramatic ones. It looked as if they would knock Clemson out of the CFP when, trailing 14-10 late, Sellers meandered his way past seemingly every Tigers defender to score from 20 yards and make it 17-14.\n\nClemson quickly charged back into field goal range, but Demetrius Knight Jr. picked off an ill-advised Cade Klubnik pass to seal the win.\n\nMaybe no game lit Williams-Brice Stadium up in 2024 like Missouri's visit in mid-November. With both teams still harboring faint conference title hopes and Mizzou's Brady Cook returning from injury, South Carolina took a 21-6 lead into halftime. But Mizzou came back, and the teams traded the lead four times in the last nine minutes. Luther Burden III's incredible 37-yard, fourth-down touchdown with 1:10 looked as if it might win the game for the visitors, but Raheim Sanders bulled his way into the end zone with 15 seconds left instead.\n\n33. Sept. 7: No. 7 Oregon 37, Boise State 34\n\nAfter scoring six touchdowns in the season opener, Boise State's Ashton Jeanty scored three more against what would eventually become the top-ranked team in the country. BSU kept pulling its nose in front, leading by six at halftime and by seven with 10 minutes left. But Tez Johnson's 85-yard punt return in the third quarter, and Noah Whittington's 100-yard kick return in the fourth kept Oregon even, and after the Broncos' offense stalled out late, Atticus Sappington's 25-yarder at the buzzer saved the Ducks.\n\n32. Nov. 23: Florida 24, No. 9 Ole Miss 17\n\nFlorida coach Billy Napier began the season on the hot seat and made it even hotter with a dismal Week 1 performance against Miami. But his Gators went young on offense and rode an improving defense to a season-ending four-game winning streak that included this stunner that would eventually knock Ole Miss out of the playoff. A Montrell Johnson Jr. touchdown gave the Gators a seven-point lead midway through the fourth quarter, and the defense took it from there, forcing a punt and then picking off Jaxson Dart passes in each of the Rebels' last two drives.\n\n31. Oct. 5: Arizona State 35, Kansas 31\n\nArizona State scored a number of tight, wild wins in its run to the Big 12 title, and tight, wild losses doomed a solid Kansas team to a 5-7 finish. This might have been the tightest, wildest game for either team. The fourth quarter alone had five lead changes. Jalon Daniels found Quentin Skinner for a 34-yard score with 2:04 left to give the Jayhawks a 31-28 lead, but while Cam Skattebo's 39-yard explosion set up ASU in field goal range, the Sun Devils went for the win and got it via Sam Leavitt's short TD pass to Jordyn Tyson with 16 seconds left.\n\n30. Sept. 14: Pitt 38, West Virginia 34\n\nEli Holstein followed up on his late-game efforts against Cincinnati by doing it again late in the Backyard Brawl. Down 10 points, the Panthers got to within 34-31 on Holstein's 40-yard bomb to Daejon Reynolds, got the ball back and drove 77 yards almost entirely on Holstein runs and passes. Derrick Davis Jr. plunged in from the 1 with 32 seconds left, and Kyle Louis clinched the rivalry win with an interception. Never take the Backyard Brawl away from us again. (They're taking it away from us again after next season.)\n\n29. Sept. 21: No. 18 Michigan 27, No. 11 USC 24\n\n28. Oct. 12: No. 4 Penn State 33, USC 30\n\nIn the two biggest helmet games of USC's first Big Ten season, the Trojans played well both times. After falling behind Michigan 14-0 after a couple of long TD runs, they took control in Ann Arbor, with three Miller Moss touchdown passes giving them a 24-20 lead heading into the home stretch. But a 63-yard burst from Kalel Mullings set up Mullings' go-ahead score with 37 seconds remaining. Michigan won with 32 passing yards.\n\nA few weeks later at home, USC enjoyed maybe its best half of the season, surging to an early 17-3 lead on eventual Big Ten runner-up Penn State and going into halftime up 20-6. Penn State quickly tied the score in the third quarter, setting up a back-and-forth home stretch. Tight end Tyler Warren caught 17 balls for 224 yards (and threw a pass out of the Wildcat formation) in his national breakout game, Nicholas Singleton's 14-yard catch-and-run score and Jaylen Reed's interception sent the game to overtime, where USC's Michael Lantz, 3-for-3 on the day, missed a 45-yard field goal attempt. Ryan Barker nailed a 36-yarder, and PSU survived.\n\n27. Dec. 7: No. 5 Georgia 22, No. 2 Texas 19 (OT) (SEC championship game)\n\nTexas reached the CFP at 11-2 -- 0-2 against Georgia and 11-0 against everyone else. After a humbling 30-15 home loss to the Dawgs in the regular season, the Longhorns looked primed for revenge in the SEC championship when they took a 6-3 lead into halftime and Georgia's Carson Beck was knocked out of the game by an injury. But replacement Gunner Stockton twice gave the Dawgs the lead, and Texas needed a 37-yard field goal from Bert Auburn to force overtime. Auburn nailed another three-pointer to give the Horns an initial OT lead, but following a brutally physical first-down run from Stockton, Trevor Etienne scored from 4 yards to give Kirby Smart's Dawgs their third SEC title in eight seasons.\n\n26. Sept. 7: No. 16 Oklahoma State 39, Arkansas 31 (2OT)\n\nSometimes games are great in part because of the impact they have on the season as a whole. Sometimes they're great because they're just plain silly.\n\nOSU's Week 2 comeback win over Arkansas was a portend of nothing to come -- OSU would win only once the rest of the season, and Arkansas would battle back to a decent 7-6 -- but it was nonsense in the most glorious way. The Cowboys spotted the Hogs a 14-point lead, got outgained by 263 yards, got very little from star running back Ollie Gordon II, didn't score their first offensive touchdown until the fourth quarter, had their seventh-year veteran quarterback get called for taunting late in regulation, missed a last-second field goal try, missed another field goal try in overtime ... and still won because Arkansas' Taylen Green turned the ball over twice and linebacker Xavian Sorey Jr. committed a silly personal foul in the second OT.\n\n25. Dec. 31: Louisville 35, Washington 34 (Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl)\n\n24. Dec. 27: Navy 21, Oklahoma 20 (Armed Forces Bowl)\n\n23. Dec. 27: USC 35, Texas A&M 31 (SRS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl)\n\n22. Dec. 28: East Carolina 26, NC State 21 (Go Bowling Military Bowl)\n\n21. Dec. 31: No. 20 Illinois 21, No. 15 South Carolina 17 (Cheez-It Citrus Bowl)\n\nThe first 12-team CFP was increasingly fun to follow but gave us only a couple of genuine classics. But that's fine because bowl season absolutely ruled. In addition to the seven we've already covered, five more bowls deserved spots in the top 25.\n\nIn both El Paso and Fort Worth, we saw late comeback attempts foiled by failed two-point conversions. Louisville got 182 combined rushing yards from Isaac Brown and Duke Watson and two touchdown catches from Caullin Lacy and led by 14 with four minutes left, but freshman Demond Williams Jr. brought UW back with a pair of touchdown passes to Giles Jackson, the second with nine seconds remaining. With the game on the line, linebacker Antonio Watts brilliantly batted away Williams' two-point pass, and the Cardinals survived.\n\nFour days earlier, we had seen something similar in the Armed Forces Bowl. Oklahoma went up 14-0 on Navy in the first quarter, but the Midshipmen slowly took the advantage. Blake Horvath's 95-yard touchdown run made it 14-14 in the third quarter, and his more conventional 6-yard score made it 21-14. Michael Hawkins Jr. found Jake Roberts for a 10-yard score with six seconds remaining, but Hawkins couldn't find anyone open before Justin Reed sacked him to clinch Navy's first win over an SEC team since a 2004 victory over Vanderbilt.\n\nIn Vegas on Dec. 27, we got a rarity: A game between two quarterbacks who actually started for much of the season and should return to their same teams next year. And they put on a show. Texas A&M's Marcel Reed drove a 17-0 third-quarter run to put A&M up 24-7, but a pair of Jayden Maiava TD passes drove a 21-0 USC run in response. Reed's 19-yard score gave A&M a 31-28 lead with 1:49 left, but Maiava found Kyle Ford for a 7-yard score with eight seconds left, and USC prevailed. This one gave us one of the season's most delightful win probability charts as well.\n\nThe two most hostile bowls got pretty high marks. Any ECU-NC State game is going to be personal, as ECU fans look forward to no matchup more than this one. And after a couple of wild swings -- ECU went up 20-7 heading into the fourth quarter, but two Wolfpack TDs in four minutes gave them a sudden lead -- we got one of the season's wildest endings. First, ECU's Rahjai Harris took a simple handoff on third-and-10 and took it 86 yards for the go-ahead score.\n\nThen, after Dontavius Nash's interception sealed an ECU win, we got ourselves a brawl. Eight players were ejected, a ref was bloodied, and we got a pretty clear reminder of how bitter this rivalry really is.\n\nThen there was the entirely unexpected hostility of Illinois-South Carolina. The first meeting between the programs was ultra-tight -- neither team ever led by more than four -- and before Josh McCray's second touchdown gave the Illini a fun win, Illinois coach Bret Bielema baited South Carolina's Shane Beamer into a strange fit of rage that doubled the game's intensity.\n\nWhen I'm in charge of all football scheduling, I will maximize the effects of sudden and unexpected bowl blood feuds by immediately scheduling these teams to meet in the same stadium in Week 0 of the following season.\n\n20. Sept. 7: Northern Illinois 16, No. 5 Notre Dame 14\n\nIf Notre Dame had gotten a few more bounces against Ohio State in Atlanta, we might have ended up with a situation in which the only team to beat the national champion was Thomas Hammock's NIU Huskies. NIU certainly needed some breaks to win as a 28.5-point underdog, but damned if everything didn't fall into place. Notre Dame scored on its first drive to take an easy 7-0 lead, but the rest of the game was like one hornet's nest after another. Antario Brown caught an absolute BB from Ethan Hampton -- the ball seemed to teleport between two Irish defenders -- and raced 83 yards for the tying touchdown. Notre Dame quaterback Riley Leonard threw two picks that resulted in Huskies field goals, and NIU blocked field goal attempts at the end of each half.\n\nJeremiyah Love's 34-yard touchdown run gave Notre Dame a 14-13 lead, but NIU converted a late fourth down, Kanon Woodill drilled a 35-yard field goal with 31 seconds left, and Cade Haberman's second blocked field goal of the afternoon, on a last-gasp Irish 62-yarder, sealed the deal. It was the first time since Texas fell to Kansas in 2021 that a favorite of four touchdowns or more lost. It forced Notre Dame to be perfect the rest of the season to reach the CFP, but the Irish pulled it off.\n\n19. Nov. 23: No. 25 Illinois 38, Rutgers 31\n\nIt has never been proved that icing a kicker has any effect. I'd like to think that Greg Schiano will think twice about deploying the tactic. Illinois was about to attempt a 58-yard field goal into the wind with Rutgers holding a late lead in Piscataway, but Schiano called timeout, giving Bret Bielema a chance to second-guess himself. That worked out pretty well for the Illini.\n\n18. Nov. 30: Michigan 13, No. 2 Ohio State 10\n\nLet me try to put a stop to something right now. I've noticed a string of commentary that's popped up since Ohio State's national title win over Notre Dame: Basically, since the Buckeyes bounced back and won the national title, this amazing Rivalry Week upset officially meant nothing, and we've therefore ruined the best regular season in sports. This is a real thing I've seen from a few corners of the internet.\n\nNow, teams have suffered devastating rivalry losses before and have still come back to get a shot at the title -- Ohio State in 2022 (Michigan), Alabama and Georgia in 2017 (Auburn), Alabama in 2011 (LSU), even Florida in 1996 (Florida State) -- so this wasn't a new thing even if, granted, none of those teams got those chances after suffering two regular season losses. But so be it. We elected to hand out a few more mulligans to create a national playoff that is actually representative of the entire nation. And the playoff was super fun! And Michigan fans sure seemed to be enjoying their win over Ohio State just as much during the title game as they did right after it first happened.\n\nRetroactively deciding something was meaningless is such a strange exercise. It meant everything in both Ann Arbor and Columbus for days after, it evidently made life in Columbus absolute hell for head coach Ryan Day and his family, and it potentially gave Ohio State a much more difficult national title path than it would have otherwise had. That the Buckeyes stormed back to win the title anyway was a hell of a redemption story and gave us a chance to enjoy two different things: Both the downfall and the rebound. Live in the present and enjoy enjoyable things. Stop going back and deciding that a fun thing wasn't fun after all because of 17 other things that happened. It's not healthy. (And if the playoff's expansion made it so that a coach and his family are less likely to receive death threats after a rivalry loss moving forward, maybe that's a good thing?)\n\nAnyway, this game was fascinating. Ohio State had been the best team in the country to date but seemed to think it had to beat Michigan playing Michigan ball; the Buckeyes couldn't run but kept trying, and as anxiety settled in at the Horseshoe -- you could almost hear it on television -- kicker Jayden Fielding, mostly automatic for the rest of the season, missed field goals of 38 and 34 yards. Ohio State's last four drives produced an interception, a missed field goal, a three-and-out, and a four-and-out. Michigan scored an upset almost as shocking as NIU over Notre Dame.\n\n17. Nov. 9: Georgia Tech 28, No. 4 Miami 23\n\n16. Nov. 30: Syracuse 42, No. 6 Miami 38\n\nThanks to quarterback Cam Ward and a flashy offense, Miami looked like a genuine national title contender in September, but after allowing just 41 points in four games, the Hurricanes' defense no-showed from there. Miami continued to get by with track meet wins (including a couple further up on this list), but a faulty defense always catches up with you.\n\nAgainst Georgia Tech in Week 11, Miami allowed touchdown drives of 17, nine and eight plays (combined time of possession in these drives: 19:46). The Canes trailed 28-16 in the fourth quarter, and while Ward's 38-yard TD pass to Xavier Restrepo got them to within five, Romello Height sacked and stripped Ward with 1:36 left, and Jordan van den Berg recovered to seal the upset.\n\nThree weeks later, needing only to win at Syracuse to clinch a spot in the ACC championship (and a likely CFP bid), the Canes faltered again. They charged to a quick 21-0 lead, but Syracuse scored TDs on four of five drives to tie the game at 28-28, then took the lead on a Devin Grant fumble return. Down seven with 3:42 left, Mario Cristobal elected to settle for a 27-yard field goal and trust his defense to make a stop. To no one's surprise, it didn't happen. Syracuse moved the chains three times, and Ward didn't get a shot at a heroic comeback.\n\n15. Dec. 7: No. 17 Clemson 34, No. 8 SMU 31\n\nClemson became the first bid thief of the 12-team playoff era -- call it another playoff victory for Dabo Swinney's Tigers over Alabama -- by surging to an early lead in the ACC championship and holding on for dear life. Thanks to a Kevin Jennings fumble and two quick Cade Klubnik touchdown passes, they led 14-0 after just five minutes and eventually expanded that to 24-7 at halftime. But Jennings threw three touchdown passes in the second half, the last of which went to Roderick Daniels Jr. to tie the game with 16 seconds remaining.\n\nInstead of going for two points and the win, SMU's Rhett Lashlee elected to take momentum into overtime. That backfired when Adam Randall returned the kickoff near midfield, Antonio Williams caught a 17-yard pass and Nolan Hauser nailed a 56-yard field goal at the buzzer to send the Tigers into the CFP.\n\n14. Nov. 23: Auburn 43, No. 15 Texas A&M 41 (4OT)\n\nJordan-Hare Stadium gave us every possible emotion in this wild Week 13 affair, from early glee (Auburn goes up 21-0 in the first 17 minutes) to spectacular anxiety (A&M storms back to take a 31-28 lead) to sheer relief (walk-on kicker Ian Vachon, plucked from the student body not long ago, sends the game to OT with a 29-yard field goal), to the pingpong action of a college overtime and, finally, to the almost obligatory field rush that now seems to follow every exciting win in SEC country. This was basically a four-hour advertisement for college football in all its glory and imperfection.\n\n13. Oct. 12: No. 3 Oregon 32, No. 2 Ohio State 31\n\nThere really are few things in this sport more thrilling than a big game that lives up to its billing. That remains true in the 12-team playoff era. While Ohio State was able to get revenge on Oregon in the CFP quarterfinals, this one was still just dynamite from start to finish. Oregon's offense found more success against the Buckeyes' defense than anyone all season, but the Ducks still needed a spot of fortune (and poor clock management) to see out the win.\n\n12. Oct. 12: No. 23 Illinois 50, Purdue 49 (OT)\n\nIllinois won 10 games in 2024, and Purdue lost 11. You almost couldn't blame the Illini for taking the proverbial foot off the gas after going up 24-3 on a bad team. But Purdue put together maybe the most unexpected half of the season, scoring 40 points in the final 30 minutes and taking a 43-40 lead with 46 seconds left. It was a sudden and shocking rebirth -- it was also too much time. Illinois forced overtime with a last-second field goal, then scored to start OT. Purdue got a touchdown from Arhmad Branch but couldn't nail its third 2-point conversion of the day.\n\n11. Nov. 9: No. 9 BYU 22, Utah 21\n\n10. Oct. 18: No. 13 BYU 38, Oklahoma State 35\n\nBYU got a pair of wins and losses on this list, and both of these wins came during a 9-0 start that made the Cougars feel like a team of destiny. Their ninth win came in the first Big 12 edition of the Holy War; BYU scored only once on its first six drives, and a burst of offensive competence from the Utes gave them a surprising 21-10 halftime lead. But it was 21-19 when a controversial defensive holding penalty gave BYU extra life on the final drive of the game. Will Ferrin's 44-yard field goal with three seconds left kept the Cougars unbeaten for one more week and sent Utah's athletic director into hysterics.\n\nThat one somehow paled in comparison to the finish in Provo a few weeks earlier. Oklahoma State came to town with a three-game losing streak and a banged-up defense, and starting quarterback Garret Rangel was lost to injury during the game as well. But somehow the Cowboys kept clawing away, taking the lead on a Brennan Presley touchdown with 1:13 left. 63 seconds later, Darius Lassiter happened.\n\nA strangely easy 35-yard touchdown pass with 10 seconds remaining, but glorious all the same.\n\n9. Nov. 23: No. 21 Arizona State 28, No. 14 BYU 23\n\nOh, you know, just a double-field-rush sort of game. Nothing special. ASU stormed to an early 21-0 lead but watched it slowly vanish. A late interception seemed to seal the win, but after a premature field rush, the field was cleared and BYU damn near stole the show with a Hail Mary. But ASU moved into a prime Big 12 contention spot, and the crowd rushed the field all over again.\n\n8. Sept. 21: Colorado 38, Baylor 31 (OT)\n\nThe Amazing Big 12 Finishes portion of the countdown continues with the most amazing finish. You rarely get a second chance at a Hail Mary win of sorts, but Colorado got one and took full advantage. In these teams' first conference matchup since 2010, Baylor led 31-24 thanks to three rushing and passing TDs from quarterback Sawyer Robertson, but after Shedeur Sanders ran for a fourth-down conversion, he found Will Sheppard shockingly open in the end zone with eight seconds left. And Sheppard dropped it.\n\nNo worries! On the final snap, Sanders simply found LaJohntay Wester wide open for a TD as time expired.\n\nColorado quickly scored in OT, and as Baylor was about to do the same thing, eventual Heisman winner Travis Hunter forced a Dominic Richardson fumble into the end zone, and the Buffs survived. I'm still not entirely sure how.\n\n7. Sept. 27: No. 7 Miami 38, Virginia Tech 34\n\n6. Oct. 5: No. 8 Miami 39, California 38\n\nMiami's decision to basically stop playing defense was eventually costly, but it created a pair of otherworldly track meets early in the season.\n\nOn a Friday night in Week 5, quarterback cousins Cam Ward (Miami) and Kyron Drones (Virginia Tech) combined for six passing touchdowns, and Tech held a 10-point lead with nine minutes left. Miami scored one touchdown, then scored another thanks in part to a pair of shocking plays: Xavier Restrepo made a desperate fourth-down catch while having slipped onto his back, then Ward, under pressure, chest-passed a ball to Riley Williams for a big gain. Down four, Virginia Tech got a shot at the end zone on the final play and initially seemed to have completed a Hail Mary before replay reversed the call. Whew.\n\nThe very next week, after a wild Berkeley crowd had welcomed College GameDay to town for the first time, Miami and Cal somehow gave us an even better game with an even wilder comeback. Thanks to scorching defensive play and a pair of Jaydn Ott touchdowns, the host Golden Bears took a 35-10 lead midway through the third quarter, and it was still 38-18 with about 10 minutes left. But Ward engineered drives of 75, 70 and 90 yards, the last drive starting with just 1:42 left after a controversial targeting no-call that could have prolonged a Cal drive. Ward and Elijah Arroyo connected for a 5-yard score with 26 seconds left, and somehow Miami prevailed.\n\n5. Nov. 29: No. 7 Georgia 44, Georgia Tech 42 (8OT)\n\nMost of the time of late, Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate has been a pretty straightforward rivalry: Both teams hate each other, and then Georgia wins comfortably. But with a spot in the CFP potentially on the line for Georgia -- the Dawgs would wrap up a spot with a win, but a loss might require them to beat Texas the next week in the SEC Championship -- Tech landed some haymakers and all but knocked the Dawgs out.\n\nTech took a 17-0 lead into halftime, and it legitimately should have been bigger: The Yellow Jackets finished each of their first three drives of the game inside the UGA 30 but came away with just three points. But even with Georgia's offense building some second-half success, the Jackets took a 27-13 lead with under six minutes remaining. Their in-game win probability, per ESPN Analytics, rose as high as 98.5%. But Carson Beck engineered a quick UGA touchdown drive, and on a third-and-1 with 2:10 left, Dan Jackson hit Tech quarterback Haynes King as hard as he possibly could and knocked the ball loose. Chaz Chambliss recovered, and five plays later Beck found Dominic Lovett for a short, game-tying touchdown.\n\nThen came the strangest overtime you'll ever see. The teams traded touchdowns on each of their first two possessions, but despite loads of overall offensive success on the day -- the teams combined for 1,168 total yards -- neither could hit a two-point conversion. They missed 11 of the first 13 in overtime until Nate Frazier's plunge finally won the game for the Dawgs. This game roped you in with wild swings and drama, then held you hostage for what felt like days as Kirby Smart insisted on using every overtime timeout available to him and offenses kept coming up short. All in all, a weird day at the office. A delightfully weird day, but weird all the same.\n\n4. Jan. 9: No. 7 Notre Dame 27, No. 6 Penn State 24 (Capital One Orange Bowl)\n\nLike so many great games, this national semifinal game was a slow burn. The first six drives of this game produced only three points, and it seemed Penn State might take control after a 90-yard drive finished with a five-yard Nicholas Singleton touchdown. But despite two sacks and a brief injury to Riley Leonard, Notre Dame dinked and dunked its way to a field goal right before halftime, then tied the game on the opening drive of the second half. The Irish took the lead for the first time early in the fourth quarter with Jeremiyah Love's rugged 2-yard score, but Singleton tied the game four minutes later.\n\nNow we were off and running. Dani Dennis-Sutton picked off Leonard, and Singleton scored yet again to make it 24-17 PSU. Then Jaden Greathouse took advantage of a defender who fell down to catch a short pass and race 54 yards to tie the game again. Penn State went three-and-out, but Coziah Izzard came up with a huge third-down sack with 52 seconds left to force an Irish punt. It seemed like we were headed to overtime. Nope! Looking to make a heroic play, Drew Allar threw an ill-conceived interception to Christian Gray (who, it must be said, made a spectacular play) over the middle. Notre Dame moved the chains once, and with seven seconds left Mitch Jeter nailed a 41-yarder to send the Irish to the national title game.\n\n3. Jan. 1: No. 5 Texas 39, No. 4 Arizona State 31 (Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl)\n\nThis year's best playoff game came in the first-ever quarterfinal round. Texas, having seen off ACC champion Clemson with relative ease, looked like it was going to advance pretty comfortably past Big 12 champ Arizona State in Atlanta. The Horns bolted to an early 14-3 lead after a DeAndre Moore Jr. touchdown catch and Silas Bolden punt return score. They led 17-3 at halftime after ASU went scoreless on a trio of second-quarter trips into Texas territory.\n\nA safety and a field goal bought ASU some time, but the Sun Devils still trailed 24-8 with 10 minutes left. And finally the ASU offense kicked into gear. Cam Skattebo's 42-yard touchdown pass to Malik McClain (and a two-point conversion) made it 24-16. Then Javan Robinson picked off a Quinn Ewers pass, and a 62-yard reception by Skattebo -- who was reported to be \"vomiting profusely\" on the sideline earlier in the quarter -- set up Skattebo's game-tying touchdown and two-pointer. Texas drove into field goal range, but Bert Auburn missed a 48-yard field goal with 1:39 left, and after a controversial targeting no-call on ASU's ensuing drive, Ewers again drove Texas into position for a game-winning field goal, but Auburn missed again at the buzzer.\n\nIn overtime, ASU suddenly had the dagger in its hand. Skattebo scored from three yards out -- he would finish with 143 rushing yards, 99 receiving yards and 42 passing yards -- and ASU quickly forced a fourth-and-13 on Texas' OT possession. But Ewers fired perfectly to Matthew Golden for a 28-yard score, then rang in the second OT with an immediate TD pass to Gunnar Helm and a successful two-point conversion. Andrew Mukuba picked off a third-down pass on ASU's possession, and somehow, after both teams had the game all but won, Texas got to advance.\n\n2. Sept. 28: No. 4 Alabama 41, No. 2 Georgia 34\n\n1. Oct. 5: Vanderbilt 40, No. 1 Alabama 35\n\nThe two best games of the season happened in an eight-day span, and they worked out very, very differently for Alabama. First, the Crimson Tide won the first marquee game of the season. Then they suffered the upset of the season.\n\nIn the first full-crowd Bama-Georgia game in Tuscaloosa since 2007, the home crowd witnessed just about the best single half any team played all season. Thanks in part to two Jalen Milroe runs and a Milroe TD pass, Bama raced to a 28-0 lead in under 20 minutes. The lead was still 33-15 with 10 minutes remaining, but Georgia scored twice in four minutes to make it 33-28. Bama punted, and Carson Beck hit Dillon Bell for a 67-yard score. After trailing by four touchdowns, Georgia suddenly led ... for 13 seconds.\n\nAfter the most exciting 30 seconds imaginable, Georgia still had one more chance to make a comeback. But Zabien Brown picked off Beck in the end zone with 43 seconds left, and Alabama kneeled out a wild win.\n\nThe best moment (to date) of the post-Saban era in Tuscaloosa was quickly followed by the worst.\n\nVanderbilt followed the upset script as well as any underdog ever has. The offense scored TDs on two early drives before stalling out for a bit, the defense contributed a pick-six on the perfectly deflected ball of all time, and special teams contributed a 51-yard Brock Taylor field goal in the second quarter. The Commodores led 23-7, and every time the Tide would charge back, Vandy would respond. Ryan Williams' 58-yard touchdown catch made it 30-28 Vandy late in the third quarter, but the Commodores responded with a field goal, a sack-and-strip fumble recovery, and a Diego Pavia-to-Kamrean Johnson touchdown with 5:07 left. Williams scored again to bring Bama within five points, but an eight-yard Pavia run on second-and-7 allowed Vandy to kneel out the game and trigger an incredible celebration.\n\nThe goalposts were walked miles, down Broadway and into the Cumberland River. Vandy: Turnt indeed.",

    "raw_text": "There's no midweek lull for the NBA, as Wednesday features a compelling 11-game schedule headlined by a big game in Manhattan at 7:30 p.m.on ESPN.\n\nToday's slate is heavily influenced by the injury report; we already know that heliocentric engines such as LaMelo Ball and Luka Doncic won't be active. These are the type of high-usage players who, in their absence, serve as a rising tide of usage throughout other parts of the rotation. The continued absence of Jimmy Butler via suspension plays into some of our decisions today.\n\nSifting through point totals and spreads, the best real matchup tonight also sets up as the most exciting fantasy and betting opportunity. This game, of course, is the Denver Nuggets visiting the New York Knicks in a game with the night's highest total and a close line. We covet high-scoring, competitive games in fantasy sports, even when eyeing overs in prop plays, and this game offers star power with deep respective rotations that deploy players in predictable patterns. Sign me up!\n\nWednesday's Stream Team\n\nJaden McDaniels, SF, Minnesota Timberwolves (Rostered in 38.0% of ESPN Leagues): A dynamic defensive force who sits No. 21 in steal percentage and No. 40 in block percentage overall, McDaniels is surfacing as a viable two-way threat in the wake of Donte DiVincenzo's foot injury. With more touches and shots in a top-heavy Minnesota offense that needs complementary scoring, McDaniels could sustain intriguing value and produce another rich line in tonight's matchup against the Phoenix Suns, who lack athleticism at the wing defensively.\n\nKel'el Ware, C, Miami Heat (27.5%): The Heat are clearly committed to larger lineups, which empowers Ware as a rim-protecting force. Topping 40 minutes the last time out signals Ware is going to be matched in all lineup looks, benefiting his double-double odds and the sheer value of a player who can regularly swat multiple shots. The Cavaliers present a tough challenge in the paint, but we also know Ware will be needed to match Cleveland's size.\n\nBrandin Podziemski, SG/PG, Golden State Warriors (22.1%): We've seen stretches from \"Air Podz\" dating back to his rookie season that make him look like a potential statistical star. He's got some Josh Hart in his profile, in that he can rebound at a forward-like rate for a guard while producing as a passer and off-ball defender. If the shot is falling and the minutes are steady, as has been the case lately, there is value ahead of today's tilt with a game Thunder defense. If you are chasing assists tonight, check out Charlotte's Vasilije Micic (1.1%).\n\nGuerschon Yabusele, PF, Philadelphia 76ers (10.6%): Yabusele's hustle has led to some rewarding box scores in recent outings, as the team has played better lately without Joel Embiid and Paul George in the lineup. For a little bit of scoring, rebounding, and defensive upside, \"Yabu\" is a strong play in a back-to-back setting against the Sacramento Kings.\n\nMcCormick's bets for Wednesday\n\nEvan Mobley (CLE) over 15.5 points (-120)\n\nScoring 18 points across 17 shots over the past two games since returning from injury isn't the most encouraging trend. Then again, is this even a trend? Mobley left some points on the floor via missing some open catch-and-shoot 3-pointers as well as free throws, evidence that a bigger line is coming. The Heat will send Ware and Bam Adebayo to guard Mobley, but this dynamic forward has the tools to overcome a relatively reasonable scoring threshold.\n\nMalik Monk (SAC) over 9.5 combined assists and rebounds (-120) Surpassing this mark regularly in recent outings, Monk is showing that he's far more than just a scoring guard, but rather a versatile playmaker capable of leading a roster with Domantas Sabonis and De'Aaron Fox in dimes on any given night. Set to run pick-and-roll actions with the second unit, Monk has several paths to hitting this mark against what might be a tired 76ers team playing the second leg of a back-to-back.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns (NYK) over 24.5 points (-120) Towns is among the league leaders in rebounding chances, which factors into his value for offensive rebounds, added possessions, and also trailing 3-pointers. In a showdown with the best player in the world, and against a team he played well against in the playoffs last spring, Towns is set up as a central character in the Garden tonight.\n\nProjections and Injury Reports\n\nBasketball Power Index by ESPN Analytics.

    "raw_text": "Ohio State won the national championship.\n\nOhio State had the most talented roster in the country.\n\nThe first is a fact. The second is, technically, an opinion -- one shared by everyone on ESPN's committee selecting the top 100 players of the 2024-25 season -- but it'd be tough to come up with a compelling argument for someone else.\n\n(ESPN's selection committee included Bill Connelly, David Hale, Chris Low, Max Olson, Adam Rittenberg and Paolo Uggetti.)\n\nIndeed, 10% of our top 100 list is Buckeyes, and that is probably too conservative a judgement of Ohio State's roster. Our list doesn't include Quinshon Judkins, despite his 121 scrimmage yards and three touchdowns in the national title game. It doesn't include Cody Simon or Sonny Styles, who both had more than 100 tackles this season, or Denzel Burke, who was one of the better DBs in the country, and it includes just one member of an offensive line that owned the postseason.\n\nBut ranking the top 100 players is no easy task, and frankly, we had to make some room for the rest of the country.\n\nSo Ohio State carved out a huge chunk of real estate, with Jeremiah Smith, Will Howard and Jack Sawyer among the players who used the playoff to climb the list, but the 90 other slots included a plethora of big names (17 quarterbacks) and lesser-known players who had impressive seasons (11 Group of 5 players). We prioritized players who proved their greatness over the full season, which meant some tough injury-related cuts such as Will Johnson and Benjamin Morrison, as well as shunning some clear-cut NFL prospects, such as Luther Burden III and Mykel Williams, who just didn't put up the numbers in 2024 to warrant inclusion.\n\nThe result is a celebration of some of the most exciting players (Cam Ward and Travis Hunter), up-and-coming stars (Smith, Colin Simmons) and under-the-radar talents (Shaun Dolac, Desmond Reid). Read on and remember that if someone deserving didn't make the cut, it's Ohio State's fault.\n\n-- David Hale\n\nJump to: 100-76 | 75-51 | 50-26 | 25-1\n\n100. Barrett Carter\n\nLB, Clemson, Senior\n\nStats: 42 solo tackles, 3.5 sacks, 10.5 TFLs\n\nPreseason ranking: 15\n\nCarter was Clemson's most versatile defender and defensive leader in 2024. He finished with 82 total tackles, 3.5 sacks, 10.5 tackles for loss and 8 QB hurries. Carter excelled as a pass rusher (13 pressures), a run defender (11 tackles for a loss or no gain on runs) and in pass defense, breaking up nine passes on 388 snaps in coverage. He finished his four-year stint at Clemson as one of the school's most prolific defenders, racking up 231 career tackles. -- Hale\n\n99. Tre Harris\n\nWR, Ole Miss, Senior\n\nStats: 60 receptions, 1,030 yards, 7 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 38\n\nHarris was limited by a lingering groin injury this season, but when healthy, he was one of the most dynamic receivers in college football. The 6-3, 210-pound senior played in just eight games but still managed to lead Ole Miss with 60 catches and 1,030 receiving yards. Harris became just the sixth Ole Miss receiver in history to have 1,000 receiving yards in a season. -- Chris Low\n\n98. Willie Lampkin\n\nOG, North Carolina, Senior\n\nStats: Allowed 3 pressures in 816 snaps, 4 blown run blocks\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nThe winner of the ACC's top blocking award, Lampkin hardly looks the part of a star in the trenches, but he plays like a giant. Lampkin -- 5-11, 290 pounds -- arrived at UNC as a transfer from Coastal Carolina, and former head coach Mack Brown even admitted he doubted Lampkin could hold up against the bigger, stronger competition in the ACC. Not only did Lampkin hold his own, he thrived. Over 816 snaps at right guard, Lampkin allowed just three pressures and had just four blown run blocks, paving the way for a UNC offense that rushed for 182 yards per game and helped Omarion Hampton to become a finalist for the Doak Walker Award. -- Hale\n\n97. Aireontae Ersery\n\nOT, Minnesota, Senior\n\nStats: 2% pressure percentage, 5th best among Big Ten OTs, min. 400 snaps\n\nPreseason ranking: 59\n\nThere's a reason Ersery is projected to be a potential first-round draft pick. Though there wasn't much flashy about him or Minnesota this season, the Gophers' offensive tackle was a reliable force all season long. At 6-6 and 330 pounds, Ersery's mobility and ability to eliminate defenders, made him an easy All-Big Ten first team choice. -- Paolo Uggetti\n\n96. Ja'Corey Brooks\n\nWR, Louisville, Senior\n\nStats: 61 receptions, 1,013 yards, 9 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nBrooks arrived as a transfer from Alabama and immediately became Louisville's most dangerous player in the passing game. He caught at least four passes for at least 70 yards in nine of his first 10 games, and he finished the year with 61 catches for 1,013 yards despite missing the bulk of the Cards' final three contests. He was a big-play threat, with nine catches on throws 20 yards or more downfield, but also a physical runner who racked up the 11th-most yards after contact of any receiver in the country. -- Hale\n\n95. Jarquez Hunter\n\nRB, Auburn, Senior\n\nStats: 187 carries, 1,201 yards, 8 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nHunter finished his career fourth all time among Auburn's rushing leaders with 3,371 yards. The 5-10, 209-pound senior had a career-best 1,201 yards this season, which ranked second among all SEC players. Hunter rushed for 278 yards, the most by any FBS player on the season, in a 24-10 win over Kentucky on Oct. 27. He had 214 of those yards in the second half, which was a school record. -- Low\n\n94. Desmond Reid\n\nRB, Pitt, Junior\n\nStats: 184 carries, 966 yards, 5 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAt 5-7, Reid was often dwarfed by the defenders tasked with bringing him down, but more often than not, he made them look foolish trying. Few players were as elusive in 2024, and few made a bigger all-around impact. Reid finished with 966 rushing yards, 579 receiving yards and 159 punt return yards, notching 10 total touchdowns -- including at least one each rushing, receiving and on returns. How unlikely is that stat line? In the past 20 years, former Clemson great C.J. Spiller is the only other FBS player with a 900/500/150 yardage split and a touchdown in each category in the same season. -- Hale\n\n93. Andrew Mukuba\n\nS, Texas, Senior\n\nStats: 41 solo tackles, 1 FF, 5 INTs, 6 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nA Clemson transfer who helped Texas improve from 116th in pass defense in 2023 to first in the regular season this year, he was a physical player whose big hits stopped runners cold. His interception in the second overtime against Arizona State clinched a CFP quarterfinal win for the Longhorns. He had career highs in every major category this year despite missing a game with injury, with 69 tackles, 11 passes defensed and 5 interceptions, which tied teammate Jahdae Barron for the SEC lead. -- Dave Wilson\n\n92. Jake Slaughter\n\nC, Florida, Junior\n\nStats: Played 800 snaps, pass-block grade of 83.9\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nFlorida's offensive line improved steadily toward the latter part of the 2024 season when the Gators won their past four games, and Slaughter's play in the interior of that line was a big reason why. A redshirt junior, Slaughter announced that he would return for the 2025 season after allowing just one sack and one quarterback hit this past season, according to Pro Football Focus. -- Low\n\n91. Quinn Ewers\n\nQB, Texas, Junior\n\nStats: 3,472 yards, 31 TDs, 12 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: 23\n\nEwers threw for 3,472 yards and 32 touchdowns to 12 interceptions this year, and he was the only quarterback in the country to lead his team to the CFP for the second straight year. He completed 65.8% of his passes. He averaged 241 passing yards per game, but 291 over the Longhorns' four postseason games, including 358 against Georgia in the SEC championship game. -- Wilson\n\n90. Tahj Brooks\n\nRB, Texas Tech, Junior\n\nStats: 286 carries, 1,505 yards, 17 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 37\n\nBrooks became Texas Tech's all-time leading rusher (4,557) this season and was the only Power 4 running back to top 100 yards in every game he played in this year, finishing with 1,505 yards in 11 games. He was second in the Big 12 in rushing to UCF's RJ Harvey and fifth in the FBS. Brooks scored 17 touchdowns, including three scores in three different games, including the regular-season finale against West Virginia when he had 188 rushing yards. His 23 career 100-yard games are the most in school history and fourth in Big 12 history behind Cedric Benson, Darren Sproles and Ricky Williams. -- Wilson\n\n89. Jordyn Tyson\n\nWR, Arizona State, Sophomore\n\nStats: 75 receptions, 1,101 yards, 10 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAfter an injury sidelined him for most of the 2023 season, Tyson returned to earn third-team AP All-America honors for the Sun Devils. He caught 75 passes for 1,101 yards and 10 touchdowns, but he was unavailable for ASU's CFP quarterfinal game against Texas. -- Kyle Bonagura\n\n88. Kenneth Grant\n\nDT, Michigan, Junior\n\nStats: 18 solo tackles, 3 sacks, 5 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 75\n\nGrant teamed up with All-American Mason Graham to give Michigan the top defensive tackle combination in college football. He led Michigan with two fumble recoveries and ranked second on the team with five pass breakups, while adding 3 sacks, 6.5 tackles for loss and 3 quarterback hurries. He earned second-team All-Big Ten honors and third-team AP All-America honors, and he had four tackles and a tackle for loss in Michigan's 13-10 upset win over rival Ohio State on Nov. 30. ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. lists Grant as the No. 19 overall prospect for the upcoming draft and the No. 4 draft-eligible defensive tackle prospect. -- Jake Trotter\n\n87. Tre Stewart\n\nRB, Jacksonville State, Senior\n\nStats: 279 carries, 1,639 yards, 25 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nStewart thrived in Rich Rodriguez's offense this season, totaling 1,638 rushing yards and 25 touchdowns on the ground. He's just the ninth player in the playoff era to top 1,500 yards and 25 touchdowns rushing in a season, joining the likes of Derrick Henry, James Conner and Melvin Gordon. Stewart had eight multi-touchdown games, eclipsed 200 yards on the ground three times and finished with the seventh-most rushing attempts in the country, despite getting just eight carries in the first two games of the season. -- Hale\n\n86. Kyle Louis\n\nLB, Pitt, Sophomore\n\nStats: 45 solo tackles, 7 sacks, 1 FF, 4 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nArguably the most versatile linebacker in the country in 2024, Louis did it all for Pitt. Louis racked up 105 tackles, picked off four passes, forced a fumble, and had 15.5 tackles for loss, 7 sacks, 27 pressures and 9 QB hurries. Louis and Utah's Devin Lloyd, a 2021 consensus All-American, are the only two defenders in the past 10 years to rack up 100 tackles, 4 interceptions and 7 sacks in the same season. -- Hale\n\n85. Tai Felton\n\nWR, Maryland, Senior\n\nStats: 96 receptions, 1,124 yards, 9 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nOn a team with mediocre QB play, Felton still managed to become one of the most reliable receivers in the country. He finished the season with 1,124 receiving yards, 9 touchdowns and 96 catches, tying Travis Hunter for the fourth most in college football. Felton had five 100-yard games and six games with at least nine catches. Felton racked up the fourth-most yards-after-catch in the country among wide receivers, and his 56 catches for a first down ranked third among wideouts. -- Hale\n\n84. Blake Horvath\n\nQB, Navy, Junior\n\nStats: 1,353 yards, 13 TDs, 4 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nThe centerpiece to Navy's offense in 2024, Horvath was a revelation. He was typically great in the option offense, rushing for 1,246 yards and 17 touchdowns, but he excelled as a passer, too, throwing for 1,353 yards and 13 scores with just four interceptions. -- Hale\n\n83. TreVeyon Henderson\n\nRB, Ohio State, Senior\n\nStats: 144 carries, 1,016 yards, 10 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 35\n\nDespite splitting carries with Quinshon Judkins, Henderson had a huge senior season. He averaged 7.1 yards per carry, which leads all Power 4 running backs. Henderson also saved one of the best stretches of his career for Ohio State's playoff run, totaling five touchdowns. He rushed for 1,016 yards and 10 touchdowns. Has also added 284 receiving yards on 27 receptions and another touchdown. -- Trotter\n\n82. Seth McLaughlin\n\nC, Ohio State, Senior\n\nStats: 0.90% blown-block rate\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nThough he missed Ohio State's last two regular-season games with a ruptured Achilles tendon, McLaughlin was named a consensus All-American and won the Rimington Trophy, given to the most outstanding center in college football. McLaughlin, who transferred to Ohio State from Alabama, became the fourth Ohio State center to win the Rimington. He anchored an offense up front that ranked second in the Big Ten with 37.2 points per game. -- Trotter\n\n81. Matayo Uiagalelei\n\nDE, Oregon, Sophomore\n\nStats: 24 solo tackles, 10.5 sacks, 2 FFs, 1 INT\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nThe flashes that Uiagalelei showed in his freshman season turned into him filling a major role on the Ducks' defense during this year. The sophomore from California made his presence felt nearly every time he saw the field, wreaking havoc on quarterbacks, forcing turnovers and helping Oregon's defense hold its own in the Big Ten. -- Uggetti\n\n80. Nicholas Singleton\n\nRB, Penn State, Senior\n\nStats: 172 carries, 1,099 yards, 12 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAlongside Kaytron Allen, Singleton powered one of the top running back duos in college football. He ranked fourth in the Big Ten with 3.69 yards per carry after contact. He led the league among running backs with 375 receiving yards on 41 receptions. Though Penn State came up short in the Capital One Orange Bowl playoff semifinal, Singleton ended the year with 84 yards and three touchdowns in the loss to Notre Dame. In total, he rushed for 1,099 yards with 12 touchdowns while averaging 6.4 yards per carry. -- Trotter\n\n79. Jayden Higgins\n\nWR, Iowa State, Senior\n\nStats: 87 receptions, 1,183 yards, 9 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nHiggins was a third-team AP All-American after his performance for the Cyclones this season. He had 87 catches for 1,183 receiving yards, fourth most in the nation this season, along with nine touchdowns. He and teammate Jaylin Noel were the only pair nationally to each top 1,000 yards receiving. He had nine catches for 155 yards and a TD against Utah, one of his five 100-yard games this year. -- Wilson\n\n78. Emeka Egbuka\n\nWR, Ohio State, Senior\n\nStats: 81 receptions, 1,011 yards, 10 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 28\n\nThough often overshadowed by Jeremiah Smith, Egbuka has delivered a terrific final season in Columbus. A team captain, he posted a career-best 81 receptions to go along with 1,011 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns. In the playoffs, he led the Buckeyes with 21 receptions, catching at least five passes in each of Ohio State's four playoff wins to win the national championship. ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. ranks Egbuka as the No. 4 receiver prospect in the upcoming NFL draft. -- Trotter\n\n77. Kyle Williams\n\nWR, Washington State, Senior\n\nStats: 70 receptions, 1,189 yards, 14 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nWilliams turned in a monster final season for Washington State, catching 70 passes for 1,198 yards and 14 touchdowns. It was the most prolific of his five-year career in which he finished with 248 catches with 3,608 yards and 29 touchdowns. -- Bonagura\n\n76. Riley Leonard\n\nQB, Notre Dame, Senior\n\nStats: 2,861 yards, 21 TDs, 8 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: 82\n\nAfter three offseason surgeries, Leonard started slowly in his 2024 campaign; three games into the season, he still hadn't thrown a touchdown pass. But when things clicked for Leonard, it changed everything for Notre Dame. Leonard sparked the passing game, ran with an edge that few other QBs could rival, and Notre Dame began blowing out most opponents en route to a national title game appearance. Leonard's true impact, however, is hard to capture with just numbers. His desire to win showed up routinely in big runs through defenders or must-have throws when the game was on the line, and that helped Notre Dame to its best season in more than 30 years. -- Hale\n\n75. Jackson Woodard\n\nLB, UNLV, Senior\n\nStats: 69 solo tackles, 3.5 sacks, 4 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nWoodard raised his game this fall, earning All-America honors and leading his team in solo tackles, assisted tackles, tackles against the run, tackles for loss, run stops, fumble recoveries and even pass breakups. Nationally, he ranked fourth in tackles (135) and tied for ninth in tackles for loss (17, behind only Shaun Dolac among linebackers). He also improved his tackle success rate from 85% to 92% this fall. -- Bill Connelly\n\n74. Matthew Golden\n\nWR, Texas, Junior\n\nStats: 58 receptions, 987 yards, 9 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nGolden transferred to Texas after Dana Holgorsen was fired at Houston, and he became Texas' most important receiver this season, including grabbing eight catches for 162 yards in the SEC championship game loss to Georgia. On the season, he finished with 58 catches for 982 yards and nine TDs, including a 28-yard touchdown on 4th-and-13 against Arizona State in the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl to force a second overtime. -- Wilson\n\n73. Aiden Fisher\n\nLB, Indiana, Junior\n\nStats: 49 solo tackles, 1.5 sacks, 4 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nFisher played a key role in Indiana's remarkable turnaround. Fisher earned first-team All-Big Ten honors for the Hoosiers, as Indiana ranked second in the league in defensive EPA (expected points added), trailing only Ohio State. He had 14 tackles in Indiana's 20-15 win over Michigan on Nov. 9, as the Hoosiers reached 10 wins for the first time in school history. He ranked third in the Big Ten with 118 tackles. -- Trotter\n\n72. Nic Scourton\n\nDE, Texas A&M, Junior\n\nStats: 27 solo tackles, 5 sacks, 1 FF\n\nPreseason ranking: 29\n\nIn his one season at Texas A&M after transferring from Purdue, Scourton led the Aggies with 14 tackles for loss and five quarterback sacks. He had 10 of his tackles for loss against SEC opponents, which ranked second in the league. The 6-4, 280-pound Scourton was a second-team Walter Camp All-America selection and finalist for the Lott IMPACT Award. -- Low\n\n71. Ryan Williams\n\nWR, Alabama, Freshman\n\nStats: 48 receptions, 865 yards, 8 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nWilliams had an electrifying start to his true freshman season with six of his 10 touchdowns (eight receiving and two rushing) coming in his first five games, including the game winner against Georgia on a highlight-reel 75-yard play. The 6-foot, 175-pound Williams was a second-team All-American by the AFCA and unanimous Freshman All-American. He averaged 18 yards per catch. -- Low\n\n70. RJ Harvey\n\nRB, UCF, Senior\n\nStats: 232 carries, 1,577 yards, 22 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nHarvey wrapped up a brilliant UCF career with 1,577 yards rushing and 25 touchdowns in 2024. He finished his career with 3,792 yards rushing, 720 yards receiving and 47 touchdowns, to leave as one of the best players in school history. -- Bonagura\n\n69. Diego Pavia\n\nQB, Vanderbilt, Senior\n\nStats: 2,293 yards, 20 TDs, 4 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nOne of the SEC's most entertaining and impactful newcomers, Pavia helped guide Vanderbilt to its first winning season in 11 years. He energized Vanderbilt's entire team after playing two seasons at New Mexico State and earned second-team All-SEC honors from the AP in his first season in the league. The 6-foot, 207-pound senior was granted an injunction by a judge after starting his career in junior college, which will allow him to return for the 2025 season. -- Low\n\n68. Jack Kiser\n\nLB, Notre Dame, Senior\n\nStats: 55 solo tackles, 2 sacks, 5 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nNotre Dame's all-time leader in games played and a longtime special teams standout, Kiser finally became a full-time starter in 2024 and thrived, leading the team in tackles, tackles against the run and forced fumbles. He lines up at ILB and OLB and sometimes in the slot, and he raised his coverage game in 2024 as well. His 90 tackles and 55 solo tackles were both career highs. -- Connelly\n\n67. Ahmed Hassanein\n\nDE, Boise State, Senior\n\nStats: 28 solo tackles, 9.5 sacks\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nThough Jeanty gathered plenty of the shine for the Broncos this season, what Hassanein did on the defensive side of the ball should not go unnoticed. The senior built upon his breakout junior season and was a force to be reckoned with on the defensive line alongside Jayden Virgin-Morgan. -- Uggetti\n\n66. Nick Emmanwori\n\nS, South Carolina, Junior\n\nStats: 57 solo tackles, 4 INTs, 2 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nEmmanwori was the leader in total tackles (88) on a South Carolina defense that finished 14th nationally in yards per play allowed (4.84). The 6-3, 227-pound junior was named a first-team All-American by the AP and Sporting News and was a three-year starter for the Gamecocks. He was a unanimous first-team All-SEC selection and declared for the NFL draft after the Gamecocks' bowl loss to Illinois. -- Low\n\n65. LaNorris Sellers\n\nQB, South Carolina, Freshman\n\nStats: 2,534 yards, 18 TDs, 7 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nSellers capped a stellar first year as South Carolina's starting quarterback with a sensational performance in a 17-14 road win over rival Clemson in the regular-season finale. His 20-yard touchdown run with 1:08 to play won it for the Gamecocks. The 6-3, 242-pound redshirt freshman finished with 3,208 yards in total offense and accounted for 25 touchdowns (18 passing and seven rushing). -- Low\n\n64. Jay Higgins\n\nLB, Iowa, Senior\n\nStats: 53 solo tackles, 1 sack, 2 FFs, 4 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nHiggins earned unanimous All-American honors and was named the Big Ten's Butkus-Fitzgerald Linebacker of the Year. He finished second in the league with 120 tackles and four interceptions -- no player in college football had more than 100 tackles with four picks. He topped the Big Ten with 120 tackles and a tackling rate of 92.3%. He also led the Hawkeyes with four interceptions and two forced fumbles. -- Trotter\n\n63. Drew Allar\n\nQB, Penn State, Junior\n\nStats: 3,327 yards, 24 TDs, 8 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAllar took a big step in his second season as Penn State's starter and first under coordinator Andy Kotelnicki, who opened up the downfield passing game. The junior had 51 completions of 20 yards or more, up from 28 in 2023, and maintained his accuracy, completing 71.6% of his passes during the regular season and reaching 65% in all but two games. Allar's 62.9 career completion percentage is first all time at Penn State, and he had multiple touchdown passes in seven games this past season. He must take the next step against elite Power 4 competition but will enter 2025 as one of the nation's more accomplished QBs. His 3,327 passing yards rank third in Penn State single-season history. -- Adam Rittenberg\n\n62. Rylie Mills\n\nDT, Notre Dame, Senior\n\nStats: 19 solo tackles, 7.5 sacks\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nA five-year contributor from Lake Forest, Ill., Mills has been a steady star for three seasons. He helped to see the Fighting Irish through a run of injuries in 2024 and might have been the best player on the field in their first-round win over Indiana before suffering a season-ending injury of his own. More than a quarter of his tackles were at or behind the line in 2024. He had a team-best 7.5 sacks and 24 pressures this season (both career highs) despite lining up almost exclusively as a defensive tackle. -- Connelly\n\n61. Josh Conerly Jr.\n\nOT, Oregon, Junior\n\nStats: 1.5% pressure pct., best among Big Ten OTs, min. 400 snaps\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nOregon's offensive line got off to a rocky start this season, but once it found the right combination of players, the unit turned into one of the best in the country with the way it protected Dillon Gabriel, and it was anchored by Conerly. The left tackle from Seattle will surely be playing on Sundays in the near future. -- Uggetti\n\n60. Lathan Ransom\n\nS, Ohio State, Junior\n\nStats: 46 solo tackles, 3 FFs, 1 INT, 2 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nDespite being overshadowed by fellow safety Caleb Downs, Ransom earned first-team All-Big Ten honors. He also had one of the biggest plays in Ohio State's semifinal win over Texas. On second-and-goal from the Ohio State 1-yard line, he dropped Texas running back Quintrevion Wisner for a 7-yard loss. That set the table for Jack Sawyer's game-clinching forced fumble he returned for a touchdown. Ransom ranks fourth on the Buckeyes with 72 tackles to go along with a sack, an interception and two pass deflections. -- Trotter\n\n59. Ricky White III\n\nWR, UNLV, Senior\n\nStats: 79 receptions, 1,041 yards, 11 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 79\n\nAfter a slow start following his All-American campaign in 2023, White showed out once again, recording five 100-yard games and spearheading UNLV's second straight MWC championship game appearance. He recorded his second straight 1,000-yard season, thanks in part to a three-week binge of 400 yards and five touchdowns against Fresno State, Syracuse and Utah State. And his 2,524 combined receiving yards in 2023-24 rank second to only Tetairoa McMillan. -- Connelly\n\n58. Sam Leavitt\n\nQB, Arizona State, Freshman\n\nStats: 2,885 yards, 24 TDs, 6 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nThe Michigan State transfer was a revelation in Tempe, where -- with his arm and his legs -- he helped guide the Sun Devils to the Big 12 title. With Leavitt in the lineup, ASU won 11 of its first 12 games before a double-overtime loss to Texas in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals. He threw 24 touchdown passes and scored five on the ground. -- Bonagura\n\n57. Will Howard\n\nQB, Ohio State, Senior\n\nStats: 4,010 yards, 35 TDs, 10 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nHoward saved the best stretch of his career for Ohio State's playoff run. He has posted a QBR of 96.4 in the Buckeyes' four playoff games, easily the best mark of any playoff passer. Howard has also brought an edge to the Buckeyes, with teammate Jack Sawyer calling him the \"most resilient guy\" he has ever met. Howard ranks second with a QBR of 89.6, trailing only Heisman finalist and potential No. 1 NFL draft pick, Cam Ward of Miami. Howard passed for 4,010 passing yards, 35 TDs with 10 INTs while completing 73.1% of his passes. He has also rushed for seven touchdowns. -- Trotter\n\n56. Colston Loveland\n\nTE, Michigan, Junior\n\nStats: 56 receptions, 582 yards, 5 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 26\n\nLoveland sat out Michigan's thrilling victories over USC and later Ohio State with injuries, but he still had a productive final season in Ann Arbor. Loveland ranked sixth among FBS tight ends with 58.2 receiving yards per game and led the Wolverines with 56 receptions for 582 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns. ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. lists Loveland as the No. 2 draft-eligible tight end and No. 21 overall player for the upcoming draft. -- Trotter\n\n55. Mikail Kamara\n\nDE, Indiana, Junior\n\nStats: 19 solo tackles, 10 sacks, 2 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nKamara's success in Bloomington didn't come as a huge surprise. A second-team All-Sun Belt selection in 2023, Kamara showed he not only could perform but also excel in the Big Ten, earning first-team all-league honors and becoming Indiana's first AP All-America selection in a decade. His 10 sacks marked Indiana's most since 2008, and he ranked in the top 15 nationally in both sacks and tackles for loss (15), while also recording team highs in quarterback hurries (6) and fumbles recovered (3). -- Rittenberg\n\n54. Danny Stutsman\n\nLB, Oklahoma, Senior\n\nStats: 44 solo tackles, 1 sack, 8 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 32\n\nStutsman was the leader of an Oklahoma defense that was much improved this past season, climbing from 79th in total defense (389.4 yards) in the FBS in 2023 to 19th (318.2). The senior from Windermere, Florida, ranked fourth in the SEC with 9.1 tackles per game and sixth with 110 stops overall. In three seasons, Stutsman had 376 tackles, 40 tackles for loss, 8 sacks and 3 interceptions. In 2024, Stutsman had 16 stops in a 35-9 loss to South Carolina and a career-high 19 tackles in a 30-23 loss at Missouri. -- Mark Schlabach\n\n53. Cade Klubnik\n\nQB, Clemson, Junior\n\nStats: 3,639 yards, 36 TDs, 6 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAfter an uneven first two seasons at Clemson, Klubnik finally put it all together in 2024 and emerged as one of the best QBs in the country. Klubnik topped 4,000 yards of total offense and racked up 43 touchdowns while throwing just six interceptions all season. His finish to 2024, however, might be the biggest reason for optimism moving forward. In his last three games, all vs. top-15 teams, he completed 62% of his throws for 878 yards with nine touchdowns. Klubnik likely enters 2025 as one of the favorites for the Heisman trophy. -- Hale\n\n52. Wyatt Milum\n\nOT, West Virginia, Senior\n\nStats: 0 QB hurries allowed, 0 sacks allowed in 34 of last 36 games\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nMilum was named to multiple first-team All-America teams to become the 14th consensus All-American in West Virginia history. He did not allow a sack in 34 of his last 36 games, according to the school, and did not a allow a quarterback hurry in 2024. -- Bonagura\n\n51. D'Angelo Ponds\n\nCB, Indiana, Senior\n\nStats: 35 solo tackles, 3 INTs, 9 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nPonds was among the James Madison transfers who joined coach Curt Cignetti at Indiana, and he made an immediate impact there. He helped the Hoosiers rank No. 6 nationally in points allowed and No. 12 in pass efficiency defense, while earning first-team All-Big Ten honors. His 67-yard pick-six against Washington, with ESPN's \"College GameDay\" in town, was among the more memorable plays of Indiana's season. Ponds led the team in pass breakups (9) and finished second on the team in interceptions (3). He also blocked a punt at Michigan State that led to a Hoosiers safety. -- Rittenberg\n\n50. Xavier Restrepo\n\nWR, Miami, Senior\n\nStats: 69 rec, 1,127 yards, 11 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 66\n\nAt a school that has produced the likes of Michael Irvin, Reggie Wayne and Andre Johnson, holding the all-time record for receiving yards is an impressive feat. That's exactly what Restrepo accomplished in 2924, adding 1,127 yards to his career tally to finish with 2,573 -- most in program history. Restrepo was the go-to target for Cam Ward, and he finished with 69 catches and 11 touchdowns -- one of just three Power 4 receivers to tally a 60/1,100/11 line alongside Travis Hunter and Jeremiah Smith. -- Hale\n\n49. Brashard Smith\n\nRB, SMU, Senior\n\nStats: 235 carries, 1,332 yards, 14 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAn underused receiver at Miami, Smith hit the transfer portal after 2023 in search of a fresh start. He found it with his former offensive coordinator -- and current SMU head coach -- Rhett Lashlee, who envisioned Smith as a tailback. The transition proved a stroke of brilliance, and Smith blossomed in the role, becoming one of the most explosive runners in the country. He had 10 games in 2024 in which he racked up at least 96 yards from scrimmage, and for the year, his 1,332 rushing yards ranked 15th nationally, his 1,659 scrimmage yards was ninth and his 18 scrimmage touchdowns ranked 13th. -- Hale\n\n48. Jihaad Campbell\n\nLB, Alabama, Junior\n\nStats: 55 solo tackles, 5 sacks, 2 FFs, 1 INT\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAt 21 years old, Campbell is still developing as an off-the-ball linebacker. He made quite an impact for the Crimson Tide this past season, leading the team with 117 tackles, 11.5 tackles for loss and 5 sacks. He also added 1 interception, 2 forced fumbles and 1 fumble recovery. Campbell was at his best in the Tide's 42-13 victory at LSU on Nov. 9, piling up 10 tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks. -- Schlabach\n\n47. Tyler Booker\n\nOG, Alabama, Junior\n\nStats: 87 knockdown blocks, 0 sacks allowed\n\nPreseason ranking: 31\n\nAlabama fans couldn't blame Booker for the Crimson Tide's struggles on offense this past season. He recorded a team-high 87 knockdown blocks and didn't allow a sack in 715 snaps, according to Pro Football Focus. Additionally, he surrendered only seven hurries and nine pressures. Booker, from New Haven, Connecticut, didn't grade out below 89 this past season, per Alabama's coaching staff. The physical run blocker gave up only one sack and nine pressures in his three seasons in Tuscaloosa. -- Schlabach\n\n46. T.J. Parker\n\nDE, Clemson, Sophomore\n\nStats: 34 solo tackles, 11 sacks, 6 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAs good as any defender in the country over the second half of the season, Parker utterly dominated Clemson's last six games on the D-line, in which he racked up 6 sacks, 12.5 tackles for loss and 4 forced fumbles. For the season, Parker ranked third in the ACC in sacks (11), second in TFLs (19.5) and second nationally in forced fumbles with six. He did all of that despite Clemson's defensive line turning in its worst season overall in more than a decade. Expect even bigger things in 2025 as the Tigers reload upfront, building around Parker and fellow D-lineman Peter Woods. -- Hale\n\n45. Jermod McCoy\n\nCB, Tennessee, Sophomore\n\nStats: 26 solo tackles, 4 INTs, 7 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nMcCoy was a welcome addition for Tennessee's defense after playing at Oregon State as a freshman in 2023. With McCoy locking down his side of the field, the Volunteers improved from 64th in the FBS in pass defense (221.5 yards) in 2023 to 29th (189.3) this past season. McCoy's 13 passes defended were the most by a Vols defensive back since 2021, and his SEC-leading four interceptions were the most since 2019. Three of his four picks came inside the Tennessee 3-yard line. According to PFF, his 90.3 coverage grade ranked second in the SEC and fifth among FBS cornerbacks. -- Schlabach\n\n44. Antwaun Powell-Ryland\n\nDE, Virginia Tech, Senior\n\nStats: 29 solo tackles, 16 sacks, 3 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nPowell-Ryland finished just a half-sack shy of Donovan Ezeiruaku's Power 4 lead, but when he was on his game, there might not have been a better pass rusher in the country. Powell-Ryland had three different games with at least three sacks each -- vs. Old Dominion, Boston College and Virginia -- something no power conference defender had done since Missouri's Michael Sam in 2013. Powell-Ryland's 15.1% pressure rate ranked in the top 10 among Power 4 defenders, and he added three forced fumbles and a blocked punt for good measure. -- Hale\n\n43. Nohl Williams\n\nCB, Cal, Senior\n\nStats: 33 solo tackles, 1 FF, 7 INTs, 8 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nThe nation's leader in interceptions with seven, Williams was the star of a Cal defense that was among the most underrated units in the country in 2024. Williams allowed completions on just 42.6% of his targets, and he posted an opponent QBR of just 27.5. His first half of the season was otherworldly, with interceptions in five of his first six games, and though he cooled in the second half as QBs shied away from him, his 16 passes defended led all Power 4 players. -- Hale\n\n42. Shaun Dolac\n\nLB, Buffalo, Senior\n\nStats: 81 solo tackles, 6 sacks, 5 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAfter ranking second nationally in tackles in 2022 (147), Dolac returned from a 2023 injury to top himself. He led all of FBS with 168 tackles. Buffalo's entire defense was designed to leverage ball carriers toward its linebackers, and Dolac vacuumed up nearly every tackle opportunity available. Dolac wasn't just a tackling machine -- he also ranked tied for sixth nationally with 18.5 TFLs. No linebacker had more. He's a ball hawk, too! Dolac tied for fourth nationally with five interceptions. -- Connelly\n\n41. James Pearce Jr.\n\nDE, Tennessee, Junior\n\nStats: 23 solo tackles, 7.5 sacks, 1 FF\n\nPreseason ranking: 1\n\nPearce was one of the SEC's most dominant pass rushers the past two seasons, helping the Volunteers reach the CFP in 2024. His 18.7% pressure rate was second-best among all defenders in the FBS this past season, leading to 7.5 sacks and 43 quarterback hurries. The former five-star prospect from Charlotte, North Carolina, had 71 tackles, 29.5 tackles for loss, 19.5 sacks and three forced fumbles the past three seasons combined. He's a projected first-round pick in the NFL draft. -- Schlabach\n\n40. Tate Ratledge\n\nOL, Georgia, Senior\n\nStats: 1 sack allowed, 500 snaps in 10 games\n\nPreseason ranking: 17\n\nIt was probably no coincidence that Georgia's offense found its footing once Ratledge returned to the lineup late in the season. He missed four games in 2024 after undergoing \"tightrope\" surgery for a high left ankle sprain. Easily recognized by his moustache and mullet, Ratledge was a mainstay up front for the Bulldogs. According to PFF, Ratledge allowed one sack in 500 snaps in 10 games in 2024. He had a PFF pass-blocking grade of at least 80.0 in each of the past three seasons and surrendered only 13 pressures in 1,016 pass-blocking snaps since 2021. -- Schlabach\n\n39. Bryson Daily\n\nQB, Army, Senior\n\nStats: 41 total TDs, 2,666 total yards, 4 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nArmy won the AAC in its first attempt, leaping from six wins to 12 in the process, and Daily's presence in a redesigned, retro-fied offense was the driving force. He rushed for at least 110 yards 11 times and threw for 1,000 yards despite throwing fewer than eight passes per game. Despite changes in blocking rules that particularly limited option attacks, Army's option ruled in 2024 because of Daily. He ranked fourth nationally in rushing yards (1,659) and led the nation in rushing touchdowns (32) as a quarterback. -- Connelly\n\n38. John Mateer\n\nQB, Washington State, Sophomore\n\nStats: 3,139 yards, 29 TDs, 7 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nPerhaps the best dual-threat quarterback in the country, Mateer did it all in his only season as Washington State's starting quarterback. He threw for 3,139 yards with 29 touchdown passes and ran for another 826 with 15 touchdowns. He was among the most coveted players in the transfer portal before transferring to Oklahoma. -- Bonagura\n\n37. Kyle McCord\n\nQB, Syracuse, Senior\n\nStats: 4,779 yards, 34 TDs, 12 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nPerhaps no one took advantage of his transfer move more last season than McCord, who left Ohio State for Syracuse and had the best season of his college career. In the Orange's offense, McCord was able to not just throw the ball a lot (592 pass attempts!), but he was also able to show off his efficiency and arm talent. He threw for nearly 5,000 yards on his way to leading Syracuse to a 10-win season. -- Uggetti\n\n36. Jaxson Dart\n\nQB, Ole Miss, Senior\n\nStats: 4,279 yards, 29 TDs, 6 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: 41\n\nOvershadowed by Alabama's Jalen Milroe and Georgia's Carson Beck before the 2024 season, Dart proved to be the SEC's most consistent quarterback this past season. Dart led the SEC and was third in the FBS with 329.2 passing yards per game. He completed 69.3% of his attempts and averaged an SEC-best 10.8 yards per attempt to go with 29 touchdowns and six interceptions. This past season, Dart set Ole Miss single-season records in total offense (4,774), passing yards (4,279) and passing efficiency (180.7), among others. -- Schlabach\n\n35. JT Tuimoloau\n\nDE, Ohio State, Senior\n\nStats: 35 solo tackles, 12.5 sacks, 2 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nA former top-five recruit with an incredible skill set, Tuimoloau had confounded many around Ohio State, because of inconsistent performances. But he saved his best for last, becoming one of the nation's most disruptive pass rushers, especially during Ohio State's CFP run. He recorded 5.5 sacks and eight tackles for loss in wins against Tennessee, Oregon and Texas, and recorded 21.5 tackles for loss, third-most in all of college football. Tuimoloau earned All-Big Ten honors and has recorded half of his career sacks total this season (12.5). -- Rittenberg\n\n34. Mike Green\n\nDE, Marshall, Sophomore\n\nStats: 38 solo tackles, 17 sacks, 3 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nA Virginia transfer, Green lit up in his redshirt freshman season -- in the last five games of 2023, he produced 6.5 tackles for loss and 3.5 sacks -- and maintained that level through all of 2024. He had at least one tackle for loss in 11 games and at least two in six, and he earned Sun Belt Player of the Year honors while leading a surprise conference title run. His 22.5 TFLs rank second in FBS, and it took Abdul Carter (23.5) 16 games to top what he did in 13. -- Connelly\n\n33. Tez Johnson\n\nWR, Oregon, Senior\n\nStats: 83 rec, 898 yards, 10 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 18\n\nDespite missing two full games and dealing with an injury, Johnson had a proper follow-up to his 1,000-plus-yard season in 2023. The chemistry that Johnson had with Bo Nix is well-chronicled, but Johnson's ability to step into the role of the Ducks' No. 1 wideout and create an essential connection with Dillon Gabriel made him an integral part of Oregon's potent offense. -- Uggetti\n\n32. Donovan Jackson\n\nOT, Ohio State, Senior\n\nStats: 1 of 5 players in FBS with at least 250 snaps at both LT and LG\n\nPreseason ranking: 57\n\nOhio State's offensive line had a bumpy situation because of injuries, but things could have been significantly worse without Jackson's versatility and talent. After earning All-Big Ten honors at guard in 2022 and 2023, Jackson shifted to left tackle midway through the season, as starter Josh Simmons and backup Zen Michalski both went down with injuries. Jackson went on to earn All-Big Ten honors again, consistently preventing sacks on quarterback Will Howard and helping the offense hit its stride for its national title run. -- Rittenberg\n\n31. Derrick Harmon\n\nDT, Oregon, Senior\n\nStats: 27 solo tackles, 5 sacks, 2 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAll season long, Harmon's presence on the defensive side of the ball was something opposing teams had to worry about. Even if his numbers don't necessarily pop like others, Harmon's ability to disrupt at and through the line of scrimmage was an invaluable part of Oregon's defensive strength. -- Uggetti\n\n30. Anthony Hill Jr.\n\nLB, Texas, Sophomore\n\nStats: 59 solo tackles, 8 sacks, 4 FFs, 1 INT\n\nPreseason ranking: 64\n\nHill led Texas in tackles for loss with 16.5, and he recorded 116 tackles and eight sacks. At 6-3 and 235 pounds, he played sideline to sideline, and most notable against Oklahoma, he had 11 tackles, including 3.5 for loss, two sacks, a forced fumble and a quarterback hurry. Along with Collin Simmons, he will be the face of the Texas defense next season. -- Wilson\n\n29. Malaki Starks\n\nS, Georgia, Junior\n\nStats: 77 tackles, 4 TFLs, 1 INT, 3 PBUs\n\nPreseason ranking: 10\n\nStarks was the quarterback of Georgia's secondary, and his versatility allowed his coaches to move him around a lot during the 2024 season. He led the Bulldogs with 77 tackles with one interception and three pass breakups this past season. Starks started 14 of 15 games as a freshman in 2022, when the Bulldogs won the second of their back-to-back national titles, and was a consensus All-American as a sophomore. -- Schlabach\n\n28. Tetairoa McMillan\n\nWR, Arizona, Junior\n\nStats: 84 rec, 1,319 yards, 8 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 13\n\nA finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation's top receiver, T-Mac was a bright spot on an otherwise disappointing season for Arizona. He caught 84 passes for 1,319 yards with eight touchdowns and was perhaps the most dangerous deep threat in the country. He turned in one of the best single-game performances of the season -- regardless of position -- when he caught 10 passes for 304 yards and four touchdowns in the first game of the season. -- Bonagura\n\n27. Jeremiyah Love\n\nRB, Notre Dame, Sophomore\n\nStats: 163 carries, 1,125 yards, 17 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nCollege football was loaded with incredible running backs in 2024, but Love might have been the flashiest. Give him a reason to hurdle someone, and he'll do it. He might do it for no reason. Notre Dame's offense was at its most dangerous when he was at his healthiest, but even with a bum knee, he made maybe the two most exciting plays in the CFP semifinals -- a rugged short touchdown and a glorious, hurdle-aided two-yard gain. His 98-yard touchdown run against Indiana was the longest run of the CFP era and tied for the longest run in Notre Dame's storied history. -- Connelly\n\n26. Walter Nolen\n\nDT, Ole Miss, Junior\n\nStats: 26 solo tackles, 6.5 sacks\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nA change of scenery was exactly what the former five-star prospect needed, as Nolen blossomed in his first season at Ole Miss in 2024. After barely scratching the surface of his talent in two seasons at Texas A&M, Nolen was the anchor of the No. 2 run defense (80.5 yards) in the FBS in his only season with the Rebels. He tied for the team lead with 14 tackles for loss and was fourth with 6.5 sacks. He is one of only 14 consensus All-Americans in school history. -- Schlabach\n\n25. Kurtis Rourke\n\nQB, Indiana, Senior\n\nStats: 3,042 yards, 29 TDs, 5 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nThe Canadian who transferred from Ohio was a perfect fit to lead the offense and help Indiana to a historic season, culminating with a College Football Playoff appearance. Rourke had eight games with multiple touchdown passes, finishing with a single-season team record 29. He had only one multi-interception performance and set a team record for completion percentage (69.4), eclipsing 65% in seven consecutive games. Rourke also battled through a thumb injury on his throwing hand that required surgery and, as revealed after the season, a torn ACL in his right knee. -- Rittenberg\n\n24. Nick Nash\n\nWR, San Jos\u00e9 State, Senior\n\nStats: 104 receptions, 1,382 yards, 16 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAn SJSU lifer, Nash threw for 1,317 yards before moving to receiver in 2022. Then the damnedest thing happened: He became one of the better wideouts in the Mountain West in 2023, then became maybe the best receiver in the country in 2024. He won a triple crown of sorts, leading FBS wideouts in receptions (104), yards (1,382) and receiving touchdowns (16). He did most of his damage out of the slot, catching 84 balls for 1,165 yards. (Those numbers were also first in FBS.) -- Connelly\n\n23. Will Campbell\n\nOT, LSU, Junior\n\nStats: Allowed 2 sacks, 5 QB hits, 11 pressures in 866 snaps\n\nPreseason ranking: 6\n\nThe 6-6, 323-pound left tackle was a mainstay on LSU's offensive line from the day he stepped foot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He started each of the 38 games in which he played, logging a total of 2,554 offensive snaps during his career. This past season, Campbell played every offensive snap in 11 of the Tigers' 12 games. He surrendered two sacks and five quarterback hits all season, according to Pro Football Focus. -- Schlabach\n\n22. Jack Sawyer\n\nDE, Ohio State, Senior\n\nStats: 25 solo tackles, 9 sacks, 3 FFs, 1 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: 33\n\nSawyer delivered one of the iconic defensive plays in Ohio State history in the Buckeyes' 28-14 victory over Texas in the playoff semifinal. The senior sacked quarterback Quinn Ewers, forcing a fumble that he then returned 83 yards for the game-clinching touchdown -- the longest fumble return in Cotton Bowl and CFP history. Sawyer is a major reason the Buckeyes won their first national championship since 2014. He also became the first FBS player in a decade to record a sack with multiple pass breakups in three straight games, according to ESPN Research, all coming during Ohio State's playoff run. -- Trotter\n\n21. Omarion Hampton\n\nRB, North Carolina, Junior\n\nStats: 281 carries, 1,660 yards, 15 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 27\n\nIn any year that didn't include Ashton Jeanty, Hampton's production would've been considered a triumph. Despite North Carolina's offense being in tatters for much of the season -- including starting three different QBs -- he was a star from the outset. After rushing for 1,500 yards in 2023, Hampton somehow improved on that tally without Drake Maye in the backfield with him in 2024. He finished the season with 1,660 rushing yards, the third most nationally, and was one of just three players in the country to finish with more than 2,000 yards from scrimmage.\n\n20. Shedeur Sanders\n\nQB, Colorado, Senior\n\nStats: 4,134 yards, 37 TDs, 10 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: 24\n\nA possible No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, Sanders ranked fourth in the nation with 4,134 yards passing for an improved Colorado team that missed out on the Big 12 title game because of a tiebreaker. His 37 touchdowns passes ranked second -- behind only Cam Ward -- all of which came despite a porous offensive line that allowed him to be sacked more times than any quarterback in the country (42). -- Bonagura\n\n19. Donovan Ezeiruaku\n\nDE, Boston College, Senior\n\nStats: 37 solo tackles, 16.5 sacks, 3 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nEzeiruaku entered 2023 with ample hype, and he was at times excellent, but the pressures rarely turned into sacks, as he finished with just two all season. In 2024, however, he got home as often as anyone. Ezeiruaku finished the season with a Power 4-best 16.5 sacks, adding 20.5 tackles for loss and 15 QB hurries. He had multiple sacks in six of his 12 games, including 3.5 in his BC finale against Pitt. -- Hale\n\n18. Caleb Downs\n\nS, Ohio State, Sophomore\n\nStats: 48 solo tackles, 2 INTs, 6 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 11\n\nDowns was arguably the most significant transfer addition for Ohio State, which picked up a safety who started throughout his true freshman year for former Alabama coach Nick Saban. He became a consensus All-America selection in his first year as a Buckeye, while also earning the Big Ten's defensive back of the year award. Downs delivered highlights almost every week, displaying advanced knowledge of the game for a younger player, as well as superior talent. He helped not only in pass coverage but as an effective run stopper, and his 79-yard punt return touchdown against Indiana created separation in an eventual blowout. He ranked third on the team with 81 total tackles. -- Rittenberg\n\n17. Kaleb Johnson\n\nRB, Iowa, Junior\n\nStats: 240 carries, 1,537 yards, 21 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nJohnson didn't enter the season as Iowa's starter, but he soon emerged as one of the nation's best backs. He had 685 rushing yards and nine touchdowns in the first four games, averaged 5.6 yards per carry or better in the first nine games and reached the end zone at least once in the first 11 contests. Johnson was a finalist for the Doak Walker Award, a semifinalist for the Maxwell Award and a second-team AP All-America selection. He set single-season team records for points (138), total touchdowns (23) and rushing touchdowns (21). -- Rittenberg\n\n16. Dylan Sampson\n\nRB, Tennessee, Junior\n\nStats: 258 carries, 1,491 yards, 22 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nSampson brought balance to Tennessee's high-flying offense in 2024, setting school single-season records with 1,491 rushing yards and 22 touchdowns. He was named SEC Offensive Player of the Year and helped lead the Volunteers to a spot in the College Football Playoff. Sampson, 5-11 and 201 pounds, ran for 2,492 yards with 35 touchdowns in three seasons. He was one of UT's fastest players and was clocked at 22-23 mph on the Catapult system. -- Schlabach\n\n15. Jalon Walker\n\nLB, Georgia, Junior\n\nStats: 38 solo tackles, 6.5 sacks\n\nPreseason ranking: 67\n\nWalker had to wait three seasons to crack Georgia's starting lineup, but it was worth the wait for the inside linebacker. He captured the Butkus Award as the best linebacker in the FBS after leading the Bulldogs with 10.5 tackles for loss and tying for the team lead with 6.5 sacks. He was a one-man wrecking crew in a 30-15 win at Texas on Oct. 19 with three sacks in the first half. -- Schlabach\n\n14. Jahdae Barron\n\nCB, Texas, Senior\n\nStats: 46 solo tackles, 5 INTs, 11 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nBarron, a versatile corner who often moved around to match up with the opponents' best receiver, won the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation's best defensive back. Barron tied for the SEC lead with five interceptions and helped limit Ohio State phenom Jeremiah Smith to one catch for 3 yards in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic. He recorded 67 tackles and 11 passes broken up. -- Wilson\n\n13. Xavier Watts\n\nCB, Notre Dame, Senior\n\nStats: 53 solo tackles, 1 FF, 6 INTs, 9 PDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 52\n\nA unanimous All-American in 2023 and a consensus All-American in 2024, Watts is the most decorated player for a gritty Notre Dame team that reached its first national title game since 1988. He lines up at safety, slot corner and linebacker, he's a brilliant ball hawk, he's good in coverage, and he might be even better in run support. Whatever Notre Dame needed, Watts delivered. -- Connelly\n\n12. Harold Fannin Jr.\n\nTE, Bowling Green, Junior\n\nStats: 117 receptions, 1,555 yards, 10 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nFew players obliterate record books as much as Fannin did in 2024. He set the FBS record for receptions (117) and receiving yards (1,555) in a season, topped 100 yards in a game eight times and seemingly saved his best performances for the biggest moments: He caught a combined 19 balls for 282 yards against Penn State and Texas A&M, and in his final game, the 68 Ventures Bowl, he caught 17 passes for 213 yards. Absurd numbers for a tight end. -- Connelly\n\n11. Mason Graham\n\nDT, Michigan, Junior\n\nStats: 24 solo tackles, 3.5 sacks, 7 TFLs\n\nPreseason ranking: 2\n\nAfter propelling Michigan to its first national title in 26 years, Graham produced a final season that cemented his legacy as one of the best and most beloved interior linemen in team history. He started all 12 regular-season games and had multiple tackles in all of them, including a career-high seven in Michigan's upset of Ohio State, which marked its fourth consecutive win over its archrival. The 320-pound Graham headlined one of the nation's stingiest run defenses and created nightmares for centers and guards trying to block him. -- Rittenberg\n\n10. Kyle Kennard\n\nDE, South Carolina, Senior\n\nStats: 20 solo tackles, 11.5 sacks, 3 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nKennard had quite an impact in his only season at South Carolina, leading the SEC in tackles for loss (15.5) and sacks (11.5) with three forced fumbles. His single-season sack total ranks second in school history behind Jadeveon Clowney's 13 in 2012. The Georgia Tech transfer won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy as the top defensive player in the FBS, and he was named SEC Defensive Player of the Year by the coaches and the AP. -- Schlabach\n\n9. Dillon Gabriel\n\nQB, Oregon, Senior\n\nStats: 3,857 yards, 30 TDs, 6 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: 16\n\nThough the end to his long college career was not what Gabriel might have wanted, he once again changed teams and seamlessly fit in and helped author a high-powered offense. At Oregon, Gabriel arguably found the best version of himself, a combination of experience, production and winning while putting together his most efficient passing campaign of his career. It wasn't a storybook finale, but it was a fitting way to cap off a unique career. -- Uggetti\n\n8. Abdul Carter\n\nDE, Penn State, Junior\n\nStats: 43 solo tackles, 12 sacks, 2 FFs\n\nPreseason ranking: 20\n\nCarter wore the famed No. 11 jersey at Penn State and upheld its tradition of excellence. After playing linebacker for previous coordinator Manny Diaz, he shifted to defensive end under Tom Allen and became a dominant pass rusher with four multisack games and eight with at least one sack, and his 23.5 tackles for loss rank third in Penn State history. He was a consensus All-America selection and won the Big Ten's awards for top defensive player and top defensive lineman. Carter returned from a shoulder injury to cause havoc against Notre Dame in the CFP semifinal. -- Rittenberg\n\n7. Kelvin Banks Jr.\n\nOT, Texas, Junior\n\nStats: 0.80% pressure pct., tied for third best among FBS OTs\n\nPreseason ranking: 9\n\nHe is the first player in Texas history to win the Outland Trophy and the Lombardi Award in the same season. He started 42 games, including 39 straight, at Texas after plugging in as a starter at left tackle as soon as he arrived on campus, and he was a leader on two CFP semifinal teams at left tackle. He allowed only one sack in 935 snaps in 2024, according to Pro Football Focus. -- Wilson\n\n6. Tyler Warren\n\nTE, Penn State, Junior\n\nStats: 104 receptions, 1,233 yards, 8 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nHe not only delivered the best season for a Penn State tight end -- and one of the best in CFB history -- but expanded the imagination of what can be done at the position. He was the team's most featured target in the passing game with 104 receptions and 1,233 receiving yards -- the most ever by a tight end at Penn State and the Big Ten. He also added 218 rushing yards and four touchdowns. His performance at USC -- 17 receptions, 224 yards, one touchdown -- won't soon be forgotten. Warren's 104 catches more than tripled his total from the 2023 season (34). -- Rittenberg\n\n5. Jeremiah Smith\n\nWR, Ohio State, Freshman\n\nStats: 76 receptions, 1,315 yards, 15 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nAs Ohio State became the nation's preeminent wide receiver program, no freshman entered his first season with as much buzz as Smith. His practice exploits were legendary, and Buckeyes fans and opposing teams found out why. Smith broke all of Cris Carter's Ohio State freshman receiving records, and his 15 touchdowns and 1,315 receiving yards both rank in the top five for the school's single-season rankings. He won Big Ten awards for top freshman and top receiver and Rose Bowl MVP honors with 187 yards and two touchdowns against Oregon, which marked only the fifth time a player has had 175 receiving yards and two touchdowns in a CFP game. -- Rittenberg\n\n4. Cam Skattebo\n\nRB, Arizona State, Senior\n\nStats: 293 carries, 1,1711 yards, 21 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: NR\n\nThe former Sacramento State running back just missed out on a trip to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony by finishing fifth in the voting. A do-it-all back, Skattebo carried 293 yards for 1,711 yards with 21 touchdowns. He also caught 45 passes out of the backfield for 605 yards and three more scores. His play was the catalyst for ASU's run to the Big 12 title and College Football Playoff, where it narrowly lost to Texas in the quarterfinals. -- Bonagura\n\n3. Cam Ward\n\nQB, Miami, Senior\n\nStats: 4,313 yards, 39 TDs, 7 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: 56\n\nThat Miami didn't reach its ultimate aspirations is no fault of Ward's. He was everything Hurricanes fans could've hoped for -- and then some. Ward led the country in Total QBR (88.7), passing touchdowns (39) and completions of 20 yards or more (74). He had 11 touchdown throws that gave Miami a lead, but his defense couldn't get off the field enough late in the season to give him the chances he needed to lead the Canes to the promised land. Nevertheless, Ward turned in one of the great QB seasons in recent memory. -- Hale\n\n2. Ashton Jeanty\n\nRB, Boise State, Junior\n\nStats: 374 carries, 2,601 yards, 29 TDs\n\nPreseason ranking: 25\n\nThe best running back season since Barry Sanders' 1988 campaign belonged to Jeanty, who not only put up ridiculous numbers but took a simple run play and turned it into must-watch TV over and over again. Jeanty was, simply put, unstoppable, and his play carried Boise State to a playoff berth and one of the program's best seasons in recent history. In any other year, he would have been the Heisman winner. -- Uggetti\n\n1. Travis Hunter\n\nWR/CB, Colorado, Junior\n\nStats: 96 receptions, 1,258 yards, 15 TDs, 4 INTs\n\nPreseason ranking: 3\n\nA once-in-a-generation player, Hunter won the Heisman Trophy after playing full-time both ways -- as a receiver and corner -- for the Buffaloes as they won nine games. On offense, he caught 96 passes for 1,258 yards and 15 touchdowns and was honored with the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the nation's best receiver. On defense -- the side on which he began his career -- he was arguably the best cover corner in college football. It is an incredible combination that likely won't be replicated for decades. -- Bonagura",

    "raw_text": "It's time to rank the top prospects in Major League Baseball for the upcoming season, some of whom will be in the majors in 2025 and others who will rise through the minors in the years ahead.\n\nMany of the top prospects on this list a year ago -- including Jackson Holliday, Jackson Chourio, Wyatt Langford and Paul Skenes -- have graduated to the majors, so it is a perfect time to get familiar with a new wave of future stars ready to make their mark on the sport.\n\nPlayers who meet MLB rookie eligibility requirements (fewer than 130 at-bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster) going into the season are eligible for this list. For a quick overview of the tool grades on the 20-80 scale that are used heavily throughout this list -- and are the industry standard across baseball -- along with other key terms used in the ranking, click here.\n\nWednesday's list kicks off our 2025 top-prospect coverage. Our coverage will continue with a list of the top prospects who didn't make the top 100 on Thursday, our ranking of all 30 MLB farm systems comes Friday and team-by-team prospect lists scheduled to follow next week.\n\nNow let's move on to ranking baseball's top 100 prospects entering the 2025 MLB season, starting with a Japanese ace who has been all over the headlines in recent weeks.\n\nRankings, superlatives for Nos. 101-200\n\nJump to team's top-ranked prospect:\n\nAmerican League\n\nATH | BAL | BOS | CHW | CLE\n\nDET | HOU | KC | LAA | MIN\n\nNYY | SEA | TB | TEX | TOR\n\nNational League\n\nARI | ATL | CHC | CIN | COL\n\nLAD | MIA | MIL | NYM | PHI\n\nPIT | SD | SF | STL | WSH\n\n60 FV Tier\n\n1. Roki Sasaki, RHP, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\n4-Seam Fastball: 60/70 Slider: 55/60 Splitter: 65/70 Command: 40/50\n\nReminds me of: No single specific pitcher, but shades of a number of different front-line flamethrowers\n\nType: 6-foot-4 potential ace with three plus to plus-plus pitches\n\nWhile Sasaki doesn't fit the traditional profile for a prospect on this list, he is eligible because he signed in the international signing period as an amateur international free agent rather than as a major league free agent and meets MLB rookie eligibility standards (fewer than 130 at-bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster).\n\nSasaki also fits with some of the top pitching prospects on the last few versions of this list in terms of potential and polish. At his best, he can sit in the upper-90s and get into the triple digits, mixing in one of the best splitters on Earth and a plus slider, along with solid strike throwing and a starter-looking delivery. On Sasaki's best day, some scouts say he has two 80-grade pitches.\n\nThere are still a number of questions to answer and potential adjustments to make, though. Remember Paul Skenes learned his splinker, now his best pitch, after he was the top pick in the MLB draft. Likewise, Sasaki also needs to develop a bit more to become a major league ace.\n\nSasaki's velocity and fastball shape regressed a bit in 2024, as did his slider velocity; these both seem addressable with grip, intent and mechanical tweaks from a strong developmental organization. These issues, their cause and the solution were a big topic in presentations teams made and what Sasaki seemed most interested in.\n\nHis command (hitting specific spots) is just OK right now, but his level of control (simply throwing it over the plate) goes a long way, including in the best pro league other than MLB, because his stuff is so good. Sasaki could stand to add a cutter and/or a curveball to his arsenal to offer different looks. That's a long list of nitpicks, but don't get it twisted: Sasaki could be an ace by the end of this season if he makes quick adjustments.\n\n2. Roman Anthony, RF, Boston Red Sox\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 45/55 Game Power: 45/60 Raw Power: 65/70 Speed: 55/50 Fielding: 45/55 Throwing: 55/55\n\nReminds me of: Somewhere on the spectrum from Colton Cowser to Kyle Tucker\n\nType: Lefty-hitting outfielder who is above average at everything and could hit 30-plus bombs\n\nAnthony was a well-known prep prospect who had a rough summer showcase season then emerged as a top-two-rounds prospect with a strong senior spring in 2022. The Red Sox landed him with the last pick of the second round (No. 79 overall), but paid him late-first-round money with a $2.5 million bonus. The main questions at that point were his hit tool and overall offensive impact given that he was a likely corner outfielder.\n\nAnthony was then one of the handful of prospects we get every draft who immediately looks notably better than expected in pro ball. He's probably still a right fielder, but he has improved athletically to where he can also play a solid center field. His bat-to-ball ability, exit velos and pitch selection were all notably better than expected right after he signed and have stayed that way during his rise through the minors.\n\nThere's legitimate star potential here with the plus-plus raw power to potentially hit 30 homers, above average on-base skills, and the speed, arm and instincts for real baserunning and defensive value. That was the sales pitch for Kyle Tucker at this point in his career, though Anthony has less bat-to-ball ability, more raw power and more speed than Tucker did at this point.\n\n3. Walker Jenkins, RF, Minnesota Twins\n\nAge: 19 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 50/65 Game Power: 40/55 Raw Power: 50/60 Speed: 50/45 Fielding: 45/55 Throwing: 50/50\n\nReminds me of: J.D. Drew\n\nType: Smooth lefty hitter with incredible feel to hit along with above-average power and athleticism\n\nI first closely scouted Jenkins in the summer between his sophomore and junior year of high school and immediately wrote \"J.D. Drew?\" in my notes because of his sweet swing, advanced hit tool and power/speed combo. Luckily, that report has held up 3\u00bd years later. In the interim, Jenkins went fifth overall in one of the most loaded drafts of this century and now has jumped past Dylan Crews and Max Clark, who were drafted ahead of him.\n\nJenkins' selling point is his plus-plus bat-to-ball skills, which is helped by his efficient swing, but that also maximizes his raw power, giving him 25ish-homer upside as well. He's a fine runner with good instincts who is mostly playing center field now and will be an option there, but will likely slide to a corner spot in the big leagues. This wide base of skills and long track record makes Jenkins one of the safer and highest-probability regular among teenage prospects in recent memory; he would've been the top overall pick in many drafts and should be the top prospect in baseball in the next 12 months.\n\n4. Marcelo Mayer, SS, Boston Red Sox\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 40/50 Game Power: 45/55 Raw Power: 60/65 Speed: 45/40 Fielding: 45/50 Throwing: 55/55\n\nReminds me of: Lankier, lefty-hitting Willy Adames if it all clicks\n\nType: Smooth-handed and sweet-swinging shortstop with 25- to 30-homer upside\n\nMayer had long been hyped as a potential top pick since early in his high school career, and he delivered on that, going fourth overall in the 2021 draft out of a Southern California high school. His pro career through 2023 was more good than great, relative to those weighty expectations. The 2024 season was a step forward, with scouts reporting that he had more life to his game physically, with better run times, better range on defense and looser movements.\n\nHe also ticked up across the board in more measurable ways: his chase rate was down 3%, his swing rate was down 3%, his max exit velo was up 3 mph, his high-end exit velos jumped a tick even adjusting for natural progression, while his line drive and hard-hit rate spiked. Mayer's homer totals aren't as strong as his raw power grades because he doesn't lift and pull the ball as much as is theoretically ideal for his power. There will be push-pull mechanical and approach decisions to make in his career in terms of lift, raw power, contact and patience -- and that has all been playing out in the minors, as well.\n\nMayer is a strong defender who grades as an average defensive shortstop even without flashy range, foot speed or arm strength. He projects as a potential All-Star who posts above-average on-base percentages and hits 20-25 homers while playing shortstop. His short-term big league fit looks to be second base in the second half of 2025 if everything goes to plan, eventually becoming double-play partners with fellow highly touted prospect Kristian Campbell.\n\n5. Carson Williams, SS, Tampa Bay Rays\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 30/40 Game Power: 45/55 Raw Power: 55/60 Speed: 55/55 Fielding: 60/65 Throwing: 70/70\n\nReminds me of: Early-career Trevor Story or later-career Dansby Swanson\n\nType: Power-over-hit shortstop with Gold Glove potential\n\nI think there's a tier break after the first five to seven on this list, and Williams fits near the back of that group because the swing-and-miss inherent in his game could undermine his offensive profile. That said, he's in this group because he's at least above average at everything else on the field while being a plus-plus defender and thrower at shortstop. This provides a high floor as a low-end regular or premium utility guy.\n\nWilliams was a hit-over-power prospect whom I compared to early-career Dansby Swanson as a Southern California high schooler in the 2021 MLB draft class. Williams also sat in the mid-90s on the mound but wasn't interested in pitching as a professional. After signing, he immediately put on muscle and started leaning into that newfound power offensively while not losing his defensive prowess or speed.\n\nGiven the Rays' history, I would expect Williams to dial in his offensive approach in Triple-A for most or all of 2025 to set him up for a full big league debut in 2026 while Taylor Walls and/or Jose Caballero hold down the position until Williams is deemed ready.\n\n6. Dylan Crews, CF, Washington Nationals\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 45/50 Game Power: 45/55 Raw Power: 55/60 Speed: 60/60 Fielding: 45/50 Throwing: 55/55\n\nReminds me of: Starling Marte\n\nType: Plus power/speed combo in center field, but offensive outlook isn't totally clear yet\n\nCrews was the best player in the 2020 prep class early in his high school career but had a tough final summer, then his senior spring was cut short by the pandemic so he had to decide between heading to LSU or taking late-first-to-compensation-round money to turn pro. He chose correctly, raking at LSU for three years, winning a national title, then going No. 2 in the 2023 draft behind teammate Paul Skenes.\n\nAs he has been under the microscope for years, scouts have been picking holes in Crews' game, and it took until he reached the upper minor leagues for some of those issues to appear. Like some other players in the top 10, Crews will probably have to choose if he wants to lean into contact and on-base skills or power, as he probably won't consistently be plus at both. I think he'll choose power.\n\nCrews has some trouble with fastballs at the top of the strike zone, which are the easiest pitches to hit in the air for damage and also incredibly common to see in general, so while his raw power is plus, his game power plays a bit below that right now. There could be a mechanical adjustment to pull and lift and backspin that pitch more often (at the expense of other pitches), whereas now there are a few too many ground balls and opposite field flyouts for the current version of Crews to reach his 25-30 homer potential in the big leagues. If he gets to his power upside, I'd expect his hit tool and on-base skills to fall to average or a bit below.\n\nThat said, he has a plus raw power/speed combo, plays a good center field and has a solid feel for contact and the strike zone. He could be an adjustment or two from being a perennial All-Star. Or he could come in around where my tool grades have him projected and be a good everyday player posting 2.5- to 3.5-win seasons most years.\n\n7. Jackson Jobe, RHP, Detroit Tigers\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\n4-Seam Fastball: 55/60 Cutter: 60/65 Sweeper: 60/65 Changeup: 55/60 Command: 45/55\n\nReminds me of: 2019 Walker Buehler, but with a better changeup\n\nType: Medium-framed velo/spin merchant who can turn good hitters into a pretzel\n\nJobe (along with Cincinnati's Hunter Greene) is one of two prep right-handers to be taken with a top-five pick in the past eight MLB drafts. While not the prototypical size of an ace, Jobe's case for going that high was easy to see. He is a plus athlete who was also a pro prospect as a third baseman (and whose dad Brandt is a pro golfer), with a starter delivery, easy mid-90s velocity, feel for an above-average changeup and breaking pitches regularly over 3000 rpm. His early pro career was rocky, but he's back on track to potentially be an ace in the coming years after making his MLB debut late last season followed by two playoff appearances.\n\nJobe's four-seam fastball results (whiff rates, ball in play outcomes, etc.) play a bit below the plus-plus shape and velocity of the pitch, but his changeup outperforms its pure shape in a way that I think is related, due to the 13 mph velocity differential. After gearing up for the 95-98 mph heater at the top of the zone (he occasionally throws a two-seamer with more run), the 82-85 mph changeup acts as a late-count putaway option once hitters have geared up for the fastball. Jobe's 88-91 mph cutter is probably his best long-term breaking ball given big league trends, but he has two varieties of a low-80s sweeper that are more likely to light up Pitching Ninja.\n\nJobe has an incredible combination of athleticism, arm speed, capacity for spin and ability to create lateral movement from a conventional high three-quarters arm slot. Using his average movement for each pitch, if he aimed the slower version of his sweeper (81 mph, 15.4 inches of lateral movement) and changeup (84 mph, -17.1 inches) at the same location, they'd end up 32.5 inches apart from each other. For reference, home plate is 17 inches wide.\n\nThere's still a little work to be done in dialing in the finer points of getting big league hitters out and ramping up to 180-plus-inning workloads, but Jobe could be one of the better pitchers in baseball on a per-inning basis whenever that last step of development happens.\n\n8. Coby Mayo, 3B, Baltimore Orioles\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 40/50 Game Power: 55/60 Raw Power: 60/65 Speed: 45/40 Fielding: 40/45 Throwing: 65/65\n\nReminds me of: Somewhere on the Troy Glaus to Pete Alonso XL-framed infielder/power hitter spectrum\n\nType: 3B/1B tweener with 30-homer upside and solid feel to hit\n\nGM Mike Elias found Mayo in the 2020 pandemic-affected draft -- his second draft running the Orioles. At the time, Mayo was a 6-foot-5 south Florida prep third baseman with big power but hit tool concerns due to his long levers. The O's believed Mayo was a swing tinkerer in high school and that obscured his underlying hit-ability, so they gave him early-second-round money ($1.75 million) in the fourth round after saving money on first-round pick Heston Kjerstad.\n\nThe Orioles were right and Mayo made his MLB debut at the end of 2024, setting him up to play first base or designated hitter during the 2025 season. He also has the ability to fill in at third base, but Mayo's size is a factor in limiting his defensive upside there and he's now seen as a likely long-term first baseman given both those limitations and the Orioles' deep infield corps. He hasn't played the outfield but has the raw ability to play passably out there.\n\nMayo has a good feel for pulling and lifting the ball along with above-average ability to pick out pitches to drive and average bat-to-ball ability. Unlike many of the potential power hitters on this list, Mayo (with his 22 Triple-A homers last season) has demonstrated the ability to get to all of his raw power in games against top pitching.\n\n9. Max Clark, CF, Detroit Tigers\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 30/55 Game Power: 30/50 Raw Power: 45/55 Speed: 70/70 Fielding: 45/55 Throwing: 55/55\n\nReminds me of: Shades of Corbin Carroll or Jarren Duran, if the power comes\n\nType: An explosion of personality, foot speed, bat speed and effort\n\nClark has been compared to Walker Jenkins for almost his entire prep career, and that continues into the minor leagues. They were the top two players in the 2023 draft prep class for years in advance and were drafted that way, but the next three players coming up on this list are all gaining ground.\n\nAs the information above alludes to, Clark is a stout, 6-foot athlete with plus explosive qualities in his hands and feet, but he also grades out well in the soft skills of bat control, pitch selection, baserunning and defending. If Clark can keep leaning into his 20-25 homer upside, he could be a true star, along the lines of Carroll or Duran, but there are outcomes in which Clark hits 12-15 homers annually and still makes some All-Star teams. The give-and-take that comes with those offensive-approach choices is the main question with Clark. Like Jenkins, Clark's wide base of skills and long track record give him as high of a floor as you'll see from a player below Double-A.\n\n10. Kevin McGonigle, SS, Detroit Tigers\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 35/60 Game Power: 30/50 Raw Power: 50/55 Speed: 50/50 Fielding: 40/50 Throwing: 55/55\n\nReminds me of: Maybe an infield version of Steven Kwan?\n\nType: Left-handed hitting prodigy with average other tools\n\nMcGonigle was one of my top picks to click in the five drafts I've covered for ESPN, all of them coming from a specific type who the industry continues to underrate: standout hitters with shorter limbs and strong performances against good pitching, medium raw power, good-not-great speed and defensive ability, but strong overall instincts. This profile basically doesn't get picked in the top half of the first round -- Max Clark is the toolsier version of this type -- but usually goes in the next 15 to 20 picks. McGonigle went 37th overall in the 2023 draft, but he got a bonus commensurate with the 28th overall pick that was created by the savings from the Tigers' first pick that year: Clark.\n\nMcGonigle is a solid-average runner with enough arm to play shortstop and good feel for the position, but there's a chance he still ends up at second base in the long term since many teams will have a better defensive shortstop option in the big leagues. He showed a feel for pulling and lifting the ball in 2024 with sneaky strong exit velos, but I wouldn't expect to see his homer total jump until 2026 because he broke the hamate bone in his right hand at the end of last year and that often dampens power figures for a season.\n\nThat said, I think he has 20-homer upside, some of the best on-base skills in the minor leagues (he incredibly has almost twice as many walks as strikeouts in his pro career) with positive baserunning and defensive value. There are some teams that have him ranked ahead of Clark, which was unthinkable even to me on draft day. I'll circle back to how I finished my predraft scouting report where I ranked McGonigle 21st, knowing I had him higher than everyone else due to a disagreement on his size/upside: \"Don't complicate this, MLB teams.\"\n\n11. Bubba Chandler, RHP, Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\n4-Seam Fastball: 60/65 Slider: 55/60 Changeup: 55/60 Command: 45/50\n\nReminds me of: There are some Zack Wheeler vibes here\n\nType: A complete front-line starter with three plus pitches and solid command\n\nChandler was a Clemson quarterback, switch-hitting shortstop, and right-handed pitcher commit from the Atlanta area entering the 2021 draft. It became clear during the spring that only a couple of teams considered him seriously as a position player and he was a late-first-round talent on the mound, so football lost out once the Pirates offered $3 million at the top of the third round.\n\nChandler is quite similar to the next pitcher, Chase Dollander, as both are four-seam-fastball-dominant righties that both average 96 mph and possess bat-missing characteristics that belong at the top of the zone; both are in the handful of the best all-around fastballs in the minor leagues. Being drafted out of college and not playing football, Dollander is older and has more high-level reps while also pitching at a level lower than Chandler, so his whiff rates and other outcome-based metrics are a bit better than Chandler's. When you stack them up, Chandler has gotten further in the minors quicker by age and also by overall reps and has a better present changeup. They're close, but Chandler gets the edge here.\n\n12. Colt Emerson, SS, Seattle Mariners\n\nAge: 19 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 30/60 Game Power: 25/45 Raw Power: 45/50 Speed: 50/50 Fielding: 40/45 Throwing: 55/55\n\nReminds me of: Andres Gimenez with more walks and less glove\n\nType: Advanced lefty hitter with medium tools who fits somewhere in the infield\n\nEmerson was the early breakout star from the loaded 2023 draft prep position-player class in the summer after he was chosen 22nd overall out of an Ohio high school. His 2024 season was a slight step back, as he broke a bone in his foot, then left the Arizona Fall League early due to a hamstring issue at the end of a season when his power numbers regressed a bit, admittedly back to predraft expectations.\n\nThe easy sales pitch here is that Emerson is a plus hitter with plus pitch selection from the left side who possesses 15-20 homer upside, an infield fit and solid speed. On the negative side, some evaluators think he's a stone-cold second baseman who lacks physical projection with hitting being his lone above-average tool. There are obvious similarities with McGonigle, with McGonigle showing a little more feel for in-game power and for playing shortstop, but both players are at a stage of development when a good bit can still change. Emerson's 2025 season should help make it clearer which one of these two camps is more correct.\n\n13. Aidan Miller, SS, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 25/50 Game Power: 30/55 Raw Power: 55/65 Speed: 50/45 Fielding: 40/45 Throwing: 55/55\n\nReminds me of: Josh Donaldson or Eugenio Suarez\n\nType: A solid defensive third baseman and hitter who could hit 25 or 30 homers annually if things click\n\nMiller was one of the first names to emerge in the 2023 prep position-player class, standing out as early as his freshman year and garnering Josh Donaldson comps at a Tampa-area high school when scouts were there to see his older brother Jackson, a prep teammate whom the Reds gave over $1 million in the 2020 draft. The main concerns at draft time were that Aidan looked like a third baseman rather than a shortstop throughout high school, was 19 on draft day (a historically negative indicator), and had missed much of his draft spring due to a hand injury. For those reasons, the Phillies got him with the 27th pick after he was projected to go in the top half of the round entering the spring.\n\nIn Miller's first full minor league season, he looked good defensively at shortstop, was running a tick better than high school, and hit better than even his most bullish supporters would've guessed on draft day while getting a late-season promotion to Double-A. He's now on the third-base/shortstop spectrum and I'm leaning toward third base due to his range. There still could be another tweak needed in his offensive approach to trade some contact for more consistent loft on hard-hit balls to get that 11-home run figure from his first full season to creep up as he moves up in the minors, but the raw power is there.\n\n14. Chase Dollander, RHP, Colorado Rockies\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\n4-Seam Fastball: 60/65 Slider: 55/60 Curveball: 50/55 Changeup: 50/60 Command: 45/50\n\nReminds me of: Dylan Cease\n\nType: Potential front-line starter with a top-of-the-zone fastball and two good breaking balls\n\nDollander was a low-level follow for scouts in Georgia in the 2020 draft, then he took a huge step forward the next season as a freshman at Georgia Southern before transferring to Tennessee. Dollander put up huge numbers the next two seasons in Knoxville, winning 17 starts and striking out 228 batters en route to going No. 9 in the 2023 draft.\n\nDollander's 2023 was a slight step back for scouts as they focused on some small mechanical issues that affected his command, fastball shape and the consistency of his breaking stuff. It seemed correctable, and it was. He now has one of the best fastballs in the minor leagues, his breaking stuff has regained its crispness and his command has also improved. Dollander should spend much of 2025 in the upper minors, but could be ready to show his front-line potential in the big leagues as soon as the end of the season.\n\n15. Leodalis De Vries, SS, San Diego Padres\n\nAge: 18 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 25/50 Game Power: 30/55 Raw Power: 45/60 Speed: 45/45 Fielding: 40/50 Throwing: 60/60\n\nReminds me of: A switch-hitting version of Willy Adames?\n\nType: Tooled-up young shortstop with real power; you can imagine almost anything\n\nEvery few international signing classes, there is someone anointed as the clearly best player in the class when they're 13 or 14 years old. They hold that title until they sign at 16, and it appears to be true as they get their feet wet in pro ball. That's who De Vries was and is, and the Padres pride themselves as an organization at finding players like this and acting before other teams do. It extends to their U.S. scouting, as well, with players like Jackson Merrill and James Wood who were either unknown until late in the process or were out of favor as prospects, but every scout agreed had great tools as 18-year-olds.\n\nDe Vries turned 18 while playing in the Arizona Fall League after playing 75 games in Low-A. San Diego is aggressive in challenging players they think have star potential and can handle the aggressive approach. Even as he's been thrown in the deep end of the pool, De Vries has shown excellent feel for pulling and lifting the ball in games, hitting 11 homers when his domestic age cohorts had just wrapped up their junior years of high school. If he continues to lean into that skill, I could see him hitting 25-30 homers at maturity and being a .240 or .250 hitter with a solid walk rate. Defensively, he could bulk up enough that many teams would move him off of shortstop. It's obviously early, so he could also choose to lean into contact and prioritize sticking at shortstop above all else. Either way, De Vries looks like an incredibly precocious potential star.\n\n16. Dalton Rushing, C, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 40/45 Game Power: 50/55 Raw Power: 55/55 Speed: 45/45 Fielding: 40/50 Throwing: 55/55\n\nReminds me of: Carlos Santana with less contact, but a viable defender at catcher\n\nType: Squatty lefty hitter with power and patience who has come around as a receiver\n\nRushing was the No. 40 pick a year after Henry Davis went first overall and six years after Will Smith was the No. 32 pick -- all of them catchers drafted out of the University of Louisville. Now, Rushing is knocking on the door of the big leagues where he'll be competing with Smith for some reps behind the plate with the Dodgers. He's a later-blooming defensive catcher in part because he didn't get regular reps behind the plate at Louisville thanks to Davis' presence.\n\nRushing consistently posts plus walk rates and gets to his above-average power in games with great feel for pull and lift. Due to this approach and the step up in quality of big league pitching, his solid bat-to-ball skills should play down to below-average batting averages -- but with above-average on-base percentages. Because the Dodgers also have Austin Barnes behind Smith, Rushing will likely have to elbow his way into the lineup at designated hitter, first base, and corner-outfield spots. Rushing's pop times to second base play around average though his blocking, while fine, could use some work. Barnes is 35 years old and in the final year of his contract, so Rushing becoming a backup catcher who also finds his way regularly into the lineup elsewhere seems like how 2026 will begin, but Rushing may force that issue in 2025.\n\n17. Samuel Basallo, C, Baltimore Orioles\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 30/40 Game Power: 40/65 Raw Power: 60/70 Speed: 35/35 Fielding: 35/45 Throwing: 65/65\n\nReminds me of: Basically, Jac Caglianone if he was also a catcher\n\nType: 30+ homer potential, but has risk factors tied to chase rate and defensive development\n\nBasallo signed for a $1.3 million bonus in the 2021 international signing class but landed with the Orioles late in the process for a seven-figure talent. He was tied to the Yankees earlier, and according to industry chatter, the deal dissolved due to the loss of international bonus space tied to New York signing Gerrit Cole as a free agent.\n\nAs an amateur, Basallo was seen as a possible catcher with a big arm behind the plate and big power potential from the left side. That's basically still the scouting report, but what's somewhat shocking is that Basallo hit his way to Triple-A as a teenager, even with a troubling chase rate. Hitters with big raw power and a tendency to chase pitches out of the zone (not to mention young catchers) tend to move through the minor leagues slowly, but Basallo is the exception to the rule.\n\nIn 2025, we'll see if his bat is deemed ready for the big leagues and he plays less behind the plate, or if the Orioles prioritize Basallo making progress to reach his defensive potential by keeping him in the upper minors for the entire season. Basallo still has a wide range of potential outcomes for a player who has reached Triple-A, as both his offensive and defensive profiles could boom or bust.\n\n18. Noah Schultz, LHP, Chicago White Sox\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nSinker: 55/60 Cutter: 50/60 Sweeper: 55/60 Curveball: 45/55 Changeup: 55/60 Command: 40/50\n\nReminds me of: There's some real Chris Sale vibes if it all clicks\n\nType: 6-foot-9 lefty with a low arm slot that creates tons of life on every pitch\n\nSchultz was a well-known prep prospect with clear first-round ability, but he made it to the White Sox at the 26th pick of the 2022 MLB draft due to an unclear asking price, missing the beginning of the spring with an illness and command trouble when he did get on the mound. The command issues make some sense, given his long arms at 6-foot-9 create problems repeating his delivery and his low arm slot helps create so much movement on his pitches that they'll often run out of the strike zone.\n\nSchultz threw just 27 innings through the 2023 pro season, but last season he threw 88.1 innings, mostly in Double-A as a 20-year-old. It'll take at least two more healthy seasons to work him up to a full big league starter innings load, and there's some work to do fine-tuning locations and sequences in the upper minors. At this rate, late in 2025 or early in 2026, Schultz will force his way into the White Sox rotation, even if there will be a pitch or innings count, and show his frontline ability.\n\n19. Sebastian Walcott, SS, Texas Rangers\n\nAge: 18 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 25/40 Game Power: 30/65 Raw Power: 65/80 Speed: 55/50 Fielding: 35/45 Throwing: 60/60\n\nReminds me of: There's some Fernando Tatis Jr. as a prospect vibes, but I wouldn't expect that outcome\n\nType: 6-foot-4 infielder with 40 home run upside, but unclear position and contact ability\n\nWalcott signed for $3.2 million almost two years ago out of the Bahamas. The Rangers have moved him aggressively through the minors, and he has performed well, especially when adjusted for his age. But it makes me wonder if he'd be putting up otherworldly numbers if he was a level or two behind playing with most of the other prospects his age.\n\nI think both Walcott and Basallo, two spots above and also moved quickly through the minors, will end up as 240 hitters with average walk rates and 30+ homers annually. Walcott is a more impressive athlete because of his speed, but I believe he will eventually move to third base -- despite currently playing shortstop -- due to his projected size and strong hands. Basallo, on the other hand, is likely to be either a catcher or a first baseman. The key difference is that Basallo has already proven he can hit at a higher level in the minors.\n\n20. Josue De Paula, LF, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nAge: 19 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nHit: 30/55 Game Power: 30/60 Raw Power: 60/70 Speed: 40/40 Fielding: 40/45 Throwing: 45/45\n\nReminds me of: Yordan Alvarez\n\nType: Precocious lefty whose value is completely with the bat, but he could still be an All-Star\n\nDePaula signed for $400,000 in the 2022 international signing class, but showed he was clearly better than his bonus later that summer in his pro debut in the DSL. He has continued to post after that loud debut, splitting his 2024 season between Low-A and High-A, and my \"reminds me of\" isn't made up; a rival team compared him to Yordan Alvarez. If you scoff because De Paula only hit 10 homers last year, go check Alvarez's minor league track record.\n\nThe downside of that comp is De Paula doesn't offer much in terms of speed, defense, or arm. The upside is that he isn't just raw power projection; he's also an above average hitter with plus pitch selection and current plus in-game power, though he hasn't fully leaned into pulling and lifting the ball as much as he probably will in a few years.\n\n21. Andrew Painter, RHP, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\n4-Seam Fastball: 55/65 Cutter: 50/55 Slider: 55/65 Curveball: 50/55 Changeup: 40/50 Command: 45/55\n\nReminds me of: Justin Verlander is a common comp, given the big stuff, frame, and high arm slot\n\nType: 6-foot-7 potential frontline starter that's coming back from surgery\n\nPainter was identified early in his prep career as a potential first-round pick and he delivered on that upside, going No. 13 overall in 2021 out of a south Florida high school. In the pre-draft spring, Painter's stuff showed plus flashes -- getting into the upper-90s with a sharper slider -- after being more average-to-above the previous summer. This growth is notable, because his stuff took another step forward the next spring, regularly hitting 100 mph and overpowering hitters. As a result, he got to Double-A while becoming one of the best prospects in baseball, and he was ruled off limits in any trade. He opened the 2023 spring training with buzz that he would break camp with the big league team as a teenager.\n\nThen the momentum stopped. Painter went on the shelf with arm soreness he tried to rehab, with the potential to get back on the mound in the second half of 2023. That didn't work, and in July, he had Tommy John surgery, ending his 2023 and 2024 seasons. Painter returned to the mound in the Arizona Fall league a few months ago and his velocity was back, with flashes of the old stuff, but he obviously wasn't at the same level just yet. There's a shot Painter looks like he did in 2023 this spring, but expectations should just be that he looks solid and will spend the 2025 season in the upper minors refining his craft with a 2026 big league rotation shot a distinct possibility. If he shoves in his first few spring outings, I'm sure the hype train will start rolling again.\n\n22. Ethan Salas, C, San Diego Padres\n\nAge: 18 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nHit: 30/55 Game Power: 30/55 Raw Power: 50/60 Speed: 45/45 Fielding: 45/55 Throwing: 60/60\n\nReminds me of: I can't think of anyone specifically, but the statline may look like Will Smith's\n\nType: Young lefty-hitting catcher with above-average tools and excellent feel for catching\n\nI mentioned above with fellow Padres prospect Leodalis De Vries (No. 15) that occasionally there is a clear and obvious top player in an international signing class years in advance who backs up the evaluation immediately in pro ball. Salas wasn't quite as clear from the start as De Vries -- there was some support for Felnin Celesten, ranked later on this list, at various points of the process -- but by signing day, Salas was the consensus best player in his class.\n\nAlmost all of Salas' family (father, uncle, grandfather, older brother, younger brother) played or are playing professionally. Salas runs well for a catcher and is incredibly advanced for his age as a receiver and game caller, so all of the soft abilities you could ask for in a young catcher are present. On top of that, he's an above-average hitter with plus power projection and solid feel for getting to his power in games against older pitchers.\n\nHis 2024 season line at High-A doesn't reflect those skills, but he hit better than league average the final month of the season, and that carried over into a solid Arizona Fall League showing. Some scouts and Padres personnel saw mechanical and approach issues that Salas had in the first half corrected in the second, as the surface numbers suggest. Given the very low bar for catcher-hitting in the big leagues (the league-average hitting line is .234/.299/.380 with 13 homers per 450 plate appearances) Salas has a shot to be one of the top five to seven at the position in just a couple of years.\n\n55 FV Tier\n\n23. Matt Shaw, 3B, Chicago Cubs\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Plus bat speed and foot speed in a 5-foot-9 NFL fullback-type build\n\nShaw was the No. 13 overall pick in the loaded 2023 draft with the sales pitch being his overall athleticism, even though it was somewhat deceptive due to his thick 5-foot-9 build. He is a plus runner with plus power and solid feel in all phases. After the Cubs' confusing Isaac Paredes acquisition was corrected with him going to Houston in the Kyle Tucker trade, Shaw now looks like a potential Opening Day third baseman in Chicago. He really hammers fastballs, especially in the strike zone (the most common pitch in the big leagues) in part due to a flatter swing plane that matches the plane of the pitch, with the feel to drive those heaters to the opposite field. This means he doesn't have the conventional pull and lift to his swing that you may prefer on paper for a hitter with his 25-homer upside, but there are many ways to succeed at the plate. I'd like to see Shaw pull back on the sliders off the plate, as big league pitchers will steadily test him in that area once they see him blister a few belt-high heaters.\n\n24. Jasson Dominguez, CF, New York Yankees\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nType: Tightly wound outfielder with plus power/speed combo\n\nThe absurd buzz for Dominguez has simmered to a reasonable level now that he's ready for his first extended playing time with the Yankees. I think he'll post roughly league-average batting averages and on-base percentages with above-average-to-plus power while providing some baserunning and defensive value. That's probably not a superstar, but instead a very valuable young player who could hit 25 homers while playing an average center field.\n\n25. Travis Bazzana, 2B, Cleveland Guardians\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: Standout power, patience, speed, and polish from a second baseman\n\nBazzana wasn't a heralded recruit when he went to Oregon State out of Australia, but he hit the ground running in Corvallis, with a career line of a 1.157 OPS, 45 homers and 66 stolen bases for the Beavers en route to going No. 1 overall in the 2024 draft. He leaned into a powerful yet patient approach at the plate, especially in his draft year, and he projects to hit .265 with plus on-base percentages and 20-25 homers at his big league peak. Bazzana is a plus runner and fine defensive second baseman for now, but there's a chance he could lose some on both counts later in his career and move to center or left field. Bazzana is an incredibly hard worker and analytical thinker, so I'd bet he has a plan to stave that off for a while.\n\n26. Kristian Campbell, 2B, Boston Red Sox\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: A confounding collection of big tools, an unusual swing, and a checkered track record until 2024\n\nCampbell was the No. 132 overall pick in the 2023 draft. From Georgia Tech, he was well-known to southeastern scouts as he was a high-level follow as a prep underclassman. He lost momentum leading into the 2023 draft, with some teams not considering him as a top-10-rounds prospect by the middle of the college season. Due to his excellent contact rates, plus speed at 6-foot-3, defensive versatility and surprisingly good exit velocity, analytics departments across the league argued with scouts and swing gurus who saw little in-game power (four home runs in 217 plate appearances in his draft year) and a swing that was borderline unusable at the big league level.\n\nCampbell answered those questions quickly after being drafted, setting the minors on fire in 2024 with a .997 OPS, 20 homers, and 24 stolen bases across High-A, Double-A and Triple-A. He's probably a second-base or center-field fit long-term but isn't a fantastic defender anywhere and has fringy arm strength.\n\nThe real issue now is that his swing doesn't fit into how many teams believe swings need to work at the big league level. Using Javier Baez's well-known bat tip toward the pitcher as a point of comparison, Campbell keeps the bat almost perfectly vertical at foot plant but doesn't tilt it much toward the pitcher. This creates a slightly longer path for the barrel into the hitting zone and, more importantly, a tough mechanical balance of entering the hitting zone steeply but flattening out by contact, hopefully with some loft, especially when pulling the ball. That's a really tough balance and unique series of movements. If this issue proves to be unfixable and affects him as many scouts and swing experts expect, Campbell could underperform relative to his raw tools -- such as his above-average to plus bat control, pitch selection, and raw power -- due to inconsistent contact quality. While he already has a very flat launch angle (so this concern isn't unfounded), it wouldn't completely undermine his offensive profile.\n\nThis outcome could still be correct, which just means that Campbell would become a roughly league-average threat in the batter's box (.255 with a solid walk rate and 15-18 homers) along with some real value on the bases and on defense. That's still a really nice player to have at the league minimum for three seasons. Of course, there are some evaluators who are looking past his hitting mechanics, focusing on his results, and imagining a future star. Some rival teams think Campbell is among the top few prospects in the game, while a larger group of teams aren't sure he belongs in the top 50 of this list, as they are skeptical of outliers when it comes to hitting mechanics. Since hitters have to adjust to all kinds of pitches and pitchers, there's a narrow sense of what swings can work in the big leagues, but we can all think of some exceptions; teams don't like to bet on them. Either way, the 132nd pick of the 2023 draft is now ranked right behind the top pick in the 2024 draft on this list, a credit to the scouting and development of the Red Sox.\n\n27. Emmanuel Rodriguez, CF, Minnesota Twins\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nType: Power-and-patience center fielder with durability issues\n\nRodriguez has similarities to Jasson Dominguez (No. 24) as a compactly built center fielder with big tools. Rodriguez has slightly more raw power, but both have shown similar in-game power output. Rodriguez is a much better defensive center fielder, but Dominguez is a faster runner. Rodriguez's batting eye ranks among the entire minor leagues, but he has well-below-average bat control, projecting for something like a .235 hitter who may lead the league in walk rate, while Dominguez is closer to average on both counts. Rodriguez is below Dominguez here, primarily because of a long history of soft tissue injuries that have limited him to just 193 games over the past three seasons.\n\n28. Jordan Lawlar, SS, Arizona Diamondbacks\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Shortstop with four of the five tools grading plus, but has fringy contact tools and has been injured a lot\n\nLawlar emerged early as one of the top high school position players in the 2021 draft class and held serve, going No. 6 overall, just behind Marcelo Mayer (No. 4 on this list).\n\nAs the type above mentions, it was easy to see why with his four plus tools and a pretty good hit tool judging from his bat speed and pre-draft performance.\n\nBut it has been a tougher road as a pro. He needed shoulder surgery soon after signing, and then he was beset by issues to his ribs, chest, thumb, and hamstring. The D-backs have also had enough infield options in the majors that a clear spot in the lineup hasn't opened for him. Lawler needs to establish his health and rhythm at the plate, with the potential to start turning into a power-over-hit, toolsy shortstop by the second half, possibly in the big leagues.\n\n29. Jac Caglianone, 1B, Kansas City Royals\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nType: MLB's next Homer King, if he can clean up his approach a bit\n\nI did a deep dive on Caglianone before the draft, here are the big-picture things to know: He has plus bat-to-ball ability, well-below-average pitch selection and 40 homer type raw power. He will likely be forced to improve his pitch selection when facing better pitchers (he ranked in college and didn't need to adjust) and he will also have more time to focus on hitting now that he is putting pitching on hold (he was a second-round prospect as a pitcher). This season will tell us a lot about how to interpret Cags' trajectory for the next few years. If he doesn't improve his pitch selection, pitchers in the upper minors, and eventually the majors, won't give him much to drive and his in-game power won't match his potential.\n\n30. JJ Wetherholt, SS, St. Louis Cardinals\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nType: Above average at almost everything on a baseball field, but not in a flashy way\n\nWetherholt wasn't well known to scouts his sophomore year at West Virginia when he became a high-first-round prospect. His draft year the following spring was limited by a hamstring injury, but he still went No. 7 overall in last summer's draft and his upside remains the same. He is a plus hitter with plus pitch selection, 20-25 homer upside, above-average speed and a passable glove at shortstop who likely settles at second or third base. Sometimes this skill set can turn into a star like Jose Ramirez, but usually it becomes a solid every-day player who may make an All-Star team or two.\n\n31. Jacob Wilson, SS, Athletics\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Shortstop with incredible bat-to-ball skills, but little else\n\nWilson was the first pick after the slam dunk top-five talents in the 2023 draft (Paul Skenes, Dylan Crews, Max Clark, Wyatt Langford, and Walker Jenkins) and Oakland rushed him to the big leagues in less than a year. He is a good defensive shortstop like his father and 12-year MLB infielder, Jack, and Jacob mixes in plus-plus bat control. His power and pitch selection are well below average, though. If those two qualities don't improve, he'll profile as a solid but lower-end regular with a limited ceiling.\n\n32. Chase DeLauter, RF, Cleveland Guardians\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nType: A well-rounded potential impact outfielder, if he can stay healthy\n\nDeLauter popped for scouts with his performance in the Cape Cod League the summer before he was draft-eligible at James Madison. That was valuable because he was bad (and his swing was worse) in a key early series at Florida State, then he missed much of the spring with a broken foot after playing a mid-major schedule. Cleveland took him No. 16 overall in the 2022 draft and he has continued to beat expectations on the field despite a unique swing -- but that's only when he has been on the field. Various foot and hamstring injuries have limited him to just 96 regular-season pro games.\n\nDeLauter should open 2025 in Triple-A and has plus bat-to-ball and pitch selection abilities along with 20-25 homer power and above average corner outfield defense. There's real upside here if he stays healthy and continues proving the doubters wrong at the plate.\n\n33. Colson Montgomery, SS, Chicago White Sox\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: A power-over-hit infielder who didn't have the 2024 many expected\n\nMontgomery was a polarizing prospect in the 2021 draft class -- analytical models didn't like that he was 19 years old on draft day (a negative historical marker for prep position players), but some clubs loved his multisport background, strong exit velos, and impressive in-game performance on the showcase circuit. Chicago took him No. 22 overall and quickly looked prescient as he became one of the better prospects in baseball, but his 2024 season raised some concerns.\n\nMontgomery is 6-foot-3, 225 pounds but is playing only shortstop, where he's limited laterally by his below-average speed, with third base seeming to be where he'll ultimately land. He has fringe-to-average bat-to-ball and on-base skills with good feel for getting to his above-average-to-plus raw power in games, helping him project as a regular but probably not as a star.\n\n34. Jett Williams, 2B, New York Mets\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: A 5-foot-6 spark plug with 20-homer upside and plus-plus speed\n\nWilliams was somewhat anonymous to national scouts during his showcase summer in high school, then he became a mid-first-round pick after he packed on more strength and emerged in the spring while playing solid competition in the Dallas area.\n\nDespite being 5-foot-6, Williams has excellent feel to get to his solid-average raw power in games while also making an above-average amount of contact and picking pitches to drive. He's been playing all over the field in pro ball and probably fits long term at second base or center field because of his plus-plus speed, fringy arm strength and good-not-great hands on the infield.\n\nWilliams didn't play much in 2024 (only 33 regular-season games and 22 in the Arizona Fall League) because of wrist and ankle injuries, so 2025 will be important to see him stay healthy, settle at a position and make his big league debut as a likely fan favorite.\n\n35. Kumar Rocker, RHP, Texas Rangers\n\nAge: 25 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: A possible front-line starter, but there's a long blurb here for a reason\n\nRocker's path since his early high school career has been full of ups and downs. He was one of the first arms to emerge from the 2018 prep class, ultimately passing on mid-first-round money to go to Vanderbilt. Rocker was a legit star immediately in Nashville and seemed the likely 2021 No. 1 overall pick after his freshman year. His stuff regressed a bit and he went No. 10 overall to the Mets in the 2021 draft, but they didn't like what their physical revealed about his arm and opted to not sign him. Rocker didn't return to Vanderbilt in 2022, instead undergoing shoulder surgery and pitching briefly in an independent league before going No. 3 overall to the Rangers for an underslot deal.\n\nHe didn't look anywhere close to his old self in 2022, either in the leadup to the draft or when he took the mound in the Arizona Fall League. Then had more bad luck: Tommy John surgery on his elbow after 28 pro innings in 2023. After he came back from that injury, he suddenly looked like a version of his old self last season -- with everything he threw plus or better and he was executing those pitches pretty well.\n\nIt could appear looking back that Rocker simply needed to stop pitching long enough to surgically clear up everything the Mets saw in 2021 and get back to what he was as a freshman at Vanderbilt. But there aren't many examples of pitchers losing some measure of stuff, health and overall effectiveness and regaining it, especially this dramatically.\n\nBetween those past shoulder and elbow surgeries, no outings longer than five innings last season and fewer 50 innings thrown total in his pro career, there is still reason to be hesitant about the idea of Rocker immediately becoming a front-line starter. I'd guess he will be capped at around 100 innings in 2025. On the other hand, he has two plus-plus pitches (fastball, slider) and two more plus pitches (cutter, changeup) along with above-average control, so he's likely to put up wacky numbers in shorter stints as he builds up his workload again.\n\n36. Chase Burns, RHP, Cincinnati Reds\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Fireballing fastball/slider potential front-line starter with flair to match\n\nBurns was a seven-figure quality prep prospect in Tennessee, hitting 100 mph on a couple of short outings in showcases, but with enough questions about his command and consistency that he joined the Volunteers in Knoxville. After a strong freshman year and a move to the bullpen in his sophomore year to both work around command issues and impact games in high-leverage situations, Burns transferred to Wake Forest for his draft year in 2024.\n\nHe made progress in getting deeper into games, expanding his arsenal and getting more swing-and-miss, leading to the Reds taking him second overall last summer. Burns' fastball still tickles triple digits, and his slider is a plus-plus pitch. His curveball and changeup both flash above-average potential, and his control/command seem good enough for him to reach his front-line ceiling.\n\n37. Alex Freeland, SS, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nType: Middling utility prospect who had enormous breakthrough and now looks like an every-day player\n\nFreeland was a midtier prep prospect who got some pro attention before ending up at UCF and eventually going in the third round of the 2022 draft. Entering the draft, he was an infielder, but not a very good shortstop. He had some power and patience, but nothing was plus and he projected more as a utility guy than an impact player. That was the expectation entering 2024 before he went off, hitting 18 homers, stealing 31 bases, and drawing 91 walks while rising from High-A to Triple-A.\n\nFreeland looks looser and more athletic with more separation at the plate than he did before his huge leap. He has improved at every swing-based metric I can find and as a runner, showing fringe-to-average speed. He also got better in the field and now looks like a decent big league shortstop.\n\nHe had a number of surgeries as a child to correct a clubfoot, so working around some remaining foot/ankle limitations to become a later-blooming athlete could make some sense in trying to understand how this breakout season occurred. Freeland still probably fits best at second base long-term and has 20-homer upside, but he may post plus on-base percentages as a switch-hitter.\n\n38. Kyle Teel, C, Chicago White Sox\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: Steady, but not flashy every-day catcher who posts 2-3 WAR seasons.\n\nTeel steadily improved from a notable prep prospect to a stalwart in the University of Virginia lineup while also growing from a possible long-term catcher to an above-average defender behind the plate. He has 20-plus homer upside, but he has taken a more balanced offensive approach and projects as a .260 hitter who hits 15-18 homers. He was the headliner in Chicago's Garrett Crochet return from Boston and should make his big league debut in 2025.\n\n39. Rhett Lowder, RHP, Cincinnati Reds\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Sinker/slider-type starting pitcher who could turn into Aaron Nola if it clicks\n\nLowder broke through as a sophomore at Wake Forest with his velocity gains leading to a firmer slider that works well with his existing standout changeup and command. He had a sterling draft year, eventually being selected by the Red with No. 7 pick in the 2023 draft. He made his pro debut in 2024, going from High-A to the big leagues and performing OK but not great in his cup of coffee.\n\nLowder's sinker and slider are both average-to-above pitches more due to location than velocity or explosive life. His changeup is a plus weapon that has always been his go-to pitch, particularly when ahead in the count. He'll likely never post huge strikeout rates, but he won't walk many batters. He could reach over 180 innings if can put up average strikeout rates, which starts to look like Aaron Nola.\n\n40. Charlie Condon, 3B, Colorado Rockies\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Potential Kris Bryant-type upside, but a poor pro debut has his momentum going the wrong way\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Florida's Wyatt Langford, who was drafted at No. 4 in the 2023 draft, Condon was lightly recruited out of high school and wasn't a pro prospect until his sophomore year at Georgia. He put up huge numbers largely in a corner position, which for Condon came split between first base, third base and the outfield. By his draft year, Condon improved at third and was giving Kris Bryant vibes as a third base/outfielder tweener with a lean frame and 30-homer upside along with good-enough on-base skills. He was narrowly my top-ranked prospect in the 2024 draft -- a virtual toss-up with Travis Bazzana, just ahead of JJ Wetherholt, Jac Caglianone, Chase Burns and Hagen Smith.\n\nAs you could guess from this ranking, Condon had a very poor pro debut, which raised all the questions I raised at draft time. A slow start in pro ball was somewhat predictable as he has had trouble keeping weight on through an entire season, which would affect his power and stamina late in the summer, and he was also battling a hand injury -- but his performance was worse than expected even considering those factors. Condon's bat control played a tick or two lower than expected, as did his in-game power indicators. It was a relatively small sample (25 games), it was High-A (Wetherholt only played in Low-A), and some other top 2024 picks haven't even had debuts yet, so it's unfair to really spike Condon's prospect status. That said, flags have been raised and we'll need to watch his start to 2025 closely.\n\n41. Hagen Smith, LHP, Chicago White Sox\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nType: Lower-slot lefty slinger who could be a mid-rotation-type soon, with shades of Garrett Crochet.\n\nSmith was a notable, low-seven-figure prospect out of a Texas high school in the 2021 draft class, but his asking price wasn't met because he missed his junior year due to Tommy John surgery. He was sitting around 90 mph at that time and his short-arm action was divisive even though he threw seven no-hitters in his draft year.\n\nOnce he got to Arkansas, Smith was effective at garnering whiffs over his first two years, but there were some questions about his finer command and if he could be a dependable starter. He answered those emphatically in his draft year, striking out 161 batters in 84 innings in the loaded SEC en route to going fifth overall last summer.\n\nSmith still has more control than command and relies heavily on his mid-90s running fastball and deadly slider (both are plus pitches) with a lesser-used curveball and changeup that both need refinement. There's deception in his unique shorter-arm action and lower-arm slot, which help explains why his fastball/slider combo performs incredibly well in the strike zone relative to their more pedestrian ball-tracking movement/velo profiles. Smith needs to refine his control to have those two pitches in the zone more often and develop a third weapon, but he has the look of a No. 2/No. 3 starter who could move quickly through the minors.\n\n42. Blake Mitchell, C, Kansas City Royals\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: Lefty hitter with standout power/patience at the plate and glove/arm behind it that provides All-Star upside\n\nMitchell was the No. 8 pick in the 2023 draft out of a Texas high school but was seen as comparable to prep players going in the middle-to-late stages of the round. After a strong 2024 full-season debut, Mitchell stands basically where the Royals took him among a group of prep players from that draft who have been excellent so far.\n\nMitchell's defense, plus-plus arm and overall tool set have always stood out with scouts who are somewhat split on his overall offensive upside. As a 19-year-old in Low-A last year, Mitchell answered those questions, posting a 17% walk rate, with 18 homers and 26 stolen bases. There's some swing-and-miss inherent to his late-count, power-focused approach and that's the main risk factor. But there could be a new starting catcher with big power headed to Kauffman Stadium right as another one's storied career is winding down.\n\n43. Luke Keaschall, 2B, Minnesota Twins\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: On-base machine with medium power/speed combo and positional versatility\n\nKeaschall transferred from the University of San Francisco to Arizona State for his draft year. He was taken in the second round in 2023 because of his strong contact profile and sneaky gap power with some speed and defensive value -- but also a lack of star potential.\n\nHis contact, on-base and in-game power skills have all played a bit better than expected and he got to Double-A in his first full pro season before it was ended by Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow. He should be ready for the 2025 season, and Keaschall's speed makes him playable at second base and center field, though he isn't great at either defensively.\n\nHe's an every-day player of some sort, but he doesn't have a true plus tool or a clear best positional home, so he'll likely end up playing wherever his team has a need.\n\n44. Drake Baldwin, C, Atlanta Braves\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: Offensive-oriented potential every-day catcher who is ready for his MLB debut\n\nBaldwin was a 2022 third-round pick out of Missouri State as an offensively oriented catcher who may have to move to a corner spot if he didn't keep progressing behind the plate. He has improved to be solid there, but will probably never be a defensive standout. He also hit more than expected in pro ball, becoming a backup option to play corner outfield down the stretch in 2024 before the Braves acquired Jorge Soler via trade.\n\nBaldwin mashed at Double-A and Triple-A last season, posting a .370 OBP and 16 homers. He hasn't played anywhere other than catcher or designated hitter, so that seems to be where the Braves want him to fit in the big leagues, with an above-average OBP and 15-20 homers being realistic at some point in the next couple of seasons.\n\n45. Jonny Farmelo, CF, Seattle Mariners\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: Above-average offensive tools and plus-plus speed that drove a breakthrough before suffering a torn ACL\n\nFarmelo's stock steadily rose from summer showcase season to 2023 draft day. His innate feel to hit (despite some unique elements to his swing) combined with speed for center field and enough power to play a corner is the kind of upside teams are looking for late in the first round.\n\nHe joined the assembly line of prep position players who have given the Mariners immediate strong returns. His improved swing mechanics fueled a loud big league spring training showing then a strong 46 games in Low-A until a torn ACL ended his season prematurely. Before the injury, he showed above-average bat-to-ball, pitch selection, raw power and in-game power skills. The expectation is that his speed and center-field defense will hold when he returns during the 2025 season.\n\nI'm jumping on the bandwagon quickly before the surface numbers become so obvious that he's on every top 100.\n\n46. Jesus Made, SS, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nAge: 17 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nType: Prototypical medium-framed international signee who surprised many by having one of the best pro debut seasons in a long time.\n\nMade was the revelatory name in my August top 100 update, going from low-profile international signing (receiving a bonus of just $1 million) to one of the biggest Dominican Summer League breakout prospects in recent memory.\n\nHis data is incredible, with his contact rates (in or out of zone) and his pitch selection (in any count) all grading as at least plus, while he was posting basically major league average power metrics (some just above, some just below) like max exit velo and 90th percentile exit velos. His pull/lift numbers were also very strong, suggesting he knows how to turn that raw power into game power. I have some basic catch-all metrics in my spreadsheet of TrackMan data that grades each key hitting ability and is then adjusted for age. Of the nearly 3,500 hitters in the sheet, Made was first and by a good margin.\n\nMade is an infielder, but possibly not a shortstop long-term (it's early for confidence about that, in general) and he's an above-average runner to boot. He isn't very physically projectable, so there may not be a ton of additional projection of his power like you expect with teenaged prospects, but he has good tools, excellent performance and an exceptional amount of refinement at the plate.\n\nIf you take the bearish stance, you'd argue that Made's good-not-great tools won't improve that much and we need to see him perform like this against High-A or Double-A pitchers to know these excellent metrics aren't misleading us due to the low level of competition in the DSL. Most players who make a top 100 list after signing as international free agents (like Leodalis De Vries above) skip the DSL so they're almost never facing players of their age cohort in the minor leagues.\n\nOn the bullish end of things, this is what a medium-tooled potential superstar like Mookie Betts or Jose Ramirez, should look like at this point -- so hop on board while you can. Some rival teams think Made could become a superstar and some think he belongs on the back end of this list, if not off of it.\n\nThe Brewers are on a bit of a scouting and development heater right now and it appears they found another excellent prospect who could become an excellent big leaguer, but it's still very early.\n\n47. Brady House, 3B, Washington Nationals\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Tooled-up prospect adapting to being promoted quickly and could still be an All-Star-level talent.\n\nHouse was one of the first players to pop nationally in the 2021 draft class, showing plus-plus power potential, plus-plus arm strength, average speed and hands to play in the infield early in his high school career. He held serve, going No. 11 in the 2021 draft with the main concern at the time being his strong tendency to swing within a few pitches of most at-bats. He has dialed in his pitch selection as he has been thrown into the deep end, being forced to improve by being among the youngest players at each level he's played at, ending last season in Triple-A right after he turned 21. House hits a lot of line drives, in part because he doesn't pull or lift the ball much, so he isn't getting to all of his raw power. He projects to have fringe-average on-base percentages and average-to-above in-game power, though House adds more value by being an above-average defender at third base and offering some value as a baserunner. That projection isn't quite as lofty as predraft expectations given his raw tools, but he's tracking like a solid every-day player.\n\n48. Cooper Pratt, SS, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: An every-day shortstop with an above-average hit tool\n\nPratt had some interest in the late-first-to-second-round range coming out of the summer showcase season and into the spring before the 2023 draft, but then tailed off a bit as scouts were split on his rumored first-round asking price, offensive upside and ultimate position. The Brewers scooped him up in the sixth round for a bonus commensurate with the back of the second round; rival teams perceived this to be a great deal at the time that they wished they knew Pratt would've accepted.\n\nHis tool grades are mostly average, but as a teenage shortstop who performed well enough to be promoted to High-A in his full-season debut, Pratt is now tracking comfortably like an every-day player.\n\n50 FV Tier\n\n49. Jeferson Quero, C, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Standout defender coming back from shoulder surgery with All-Star potential\n\nQuero tore the labrum in his right shoulder during the season opener for Triple-A Nashville. He had surgery and ended up missing the entire season, though he's on track to be ready for the 2025 season.\n\nHe is an above-average defender with a plus arm, and both of those grades could be underselling his ability. Offensively, he needs to cut down on chasing pitches out of the zone, but there's enough bat control and raw power for roughly league-average offensive output -- .255 average and 15-18 homers -- which combined with his glove would make him one the best catchers in the sport.\n\n50. Moises Ballesteros, C, Chicago Cubs\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: 5-foot-8 catcher who is OK defensively, but is an offensive savant with 25-homer upside\n\nBallesteros doesn't have a typical big league frame at 5-foot-8, which also serves to limit his defensive ceiling as a catcher, even though he's improved over the past two seasons. He's good enough to at least be a part-time catching option with acceptable arm utility who also sees time at first base and designated hitter to get his bat in the lineup. Related to his frame not being very projectable, Ballesteros may be a relatively finished product despite being 21 years old.\n\nHe is the age of many 2025 draft prospects and while that cohort was playing in the Cape Cod League, Ballesteros was hitting above league average in Triple-A at the end of last season. That precocious performance and being even a part-time defensive option behind the plate is driving his value. You can expect roughly average on-base percentages and hope his pitch selection stays good enough to get to almost all of his above-average raw power. If a couple of things give a bit, he may end up being a platoon or low-end regular first baseman, but I'll bet on his advanced performances at the plate leading to a little more growth.\n\n51. Bryce Eldridge, 1B, San Francisco Giants\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: 6-foot-7 first baseman who could hit 40 homers one day\n\nEldridge was a standout hitter and pitcher as a prep underclassman, posting big exit velos against older competition and getting into the mid-90s on the mound. Despite being a 6-foot-7 power hitter, his contact rates on the showcase circuit were among the best in the 2023 prep class, so scouts evaluated him as more of a hitter than a pitcher. At the same time, an ankle injury hurt his velocity in his draft spring, though he looked like a second-rounder on the mound anyway. Eldridge ended up going No. 16 overall as a hitter-only selection to the Giants.\n\nLast year, he posted a .372 on-base percentage along with 23 homers in his first full season, mostly at High-A before getting a taste of Double-A and Triple-A while still a teenager. Eldridge has been promoted aggressively enough that his contact skills now play a bit below average. Call him a .245 or .250 big league hitter, with a solid-average walk rate and anywhere from 25 to 40 homers at his peak.\n\n52. Nick Kurtz, 1B, Athletics\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nType: Should land somewhere on the Nick Johnson to Anthony Rizzo spectrum\n\nKurtz was on the same high school team as Cooper Kinney (No. 34 pick in 2021) and Henry Godbout (potential early-round pick in 2025 playing at Virginia), and few evaluators thought Kurtz was the best prospect on his own team, which he clearly is now.\n\nHigh school first basemen are already unlikely to get a big enough bonus to forego a scholarship to a major conference school and there was concern that Kurtz couldn't get to his plus raw power in games given the long limbs from his 6-foot-5 frame. Kurtz dominated for three years at Wake Forest (164 games, 1.235 OPS, 61 homers, 189 walks) and was the No. 4 pick last summer. He had shoulder issues in college that made some teams pause, but he's a power-and-patience type with an above average glove, and he could be an All-Star.\n\n53. Jarlin Susana, RHP, Washington Nationals\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: 6-foot-6 fireballer from the Soto trade with plus to plus-plus stuff, and the control is coming around\n\nSusana signed with the Padres for $1.7 million in the 2022 international class -- after his stuff spiked during the previous class with San Diego having the best bonus offer, but he had to wait for pools to reset.\n\nThe Padres immediately brought him stateside and he was hitting 100 mph while flashing nasty breaking stuff. After just eight pro appearances, all in the complex league, he was inserted as the final player in the first Juan Soto trade.\n\nIn 2023, Susana walked nearly six batters per nine innings, and in 2024, that figure was down to four. His sinker sits 97-100 and hits 101 mph, while his cutter is a real standout. The average major league slider averages 85.5 mph, while Susana's cutter averages 89 mph and has above-average life compared to a major league slider, too. Susana should pitch in Double-A next season and will turn 21 in March; he would be the first pick in the 2025 MLB draft if he were doing this in college rather than in pro ball.\n\n54. Edgar Quero, C, Chicago White Sox\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nType: An offensively advanced, switch-hitting every-day catcher\n\nQuero was the headliner in a trade from the Angels to the White Sox at the 2023 trade deadline for rental pitchers Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez. Opinions about his defensive ability behind the plate vary, and I have him as totally fine, around average, but some teams want an above-average defender there and would use Quero at other positions to get his bat in the lineup. That might also describe what the White Sox will do if Quero and Kyle Teel are in the big leagues at the same time next year. Quero should post roughly league-average on-base percentages and 15-20 homers in his peak seasons.\n\n55. Thomas White, LHP, Miami Marlins\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nType: Long-heralded lefty who is finding his control to complement his stuff, which has been plus for years\n\nWhite was the first pitcher in the 2023 draft class to pop; I went to see him during the summer in 2021 after he was already the top player in the class and was blown away. By 2023, he flashed three plus pitches, his changeup the least developed of the three. But his command would come and go to an extreme degree, so he lasted until the 35th overall pick, getting a mid-first-round bonus ($4.1 million).\n\nWhite's first taste of full season minor leagues yielded too many walks, but he dialed it in more in 2024 and is now on the path of a premium projection potential front-line left-handed starter (say that three times fast). Sometimes this turns into Cole Hamels, other times into guys you've never heard of.\n\n56. Alejandro Rosario, RHP, Texas Rangers\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Late bloomer who always had stuff now looks like a potential starter\n\nRosario was an intriguing follow in high school, getting into the mid-90s while mixing in a nasty low-spin splitter, but he ended up going to Miami because of concerns about his command and his breaking ball. In college, he mostly started, but he posted a 6.47 ERA, and his strikeout-to-walk ratio was just over 2-to-1. The Rangers landed him in the fifth round of the 2023 draft -- a surprisingly rich zone of the draft of late, where teams take pitchers with a couple good qualities, hoping they can dial in the other few.\n\nRosario's strikeout-to-walk ratio is now at 10-to-1 through 88\u2153 innings as his control and breaking ball issues have been largely solved, while his sinker, slider and splitter all now project as plus pitches. Rosario should be challenged in the upper minors this season to see if his command can hold up against more age-appropriate competition, but he now looks like at least an impact late-inning reliever if it can't.\n\n57. Cole Young, 2B, Seattle Mariners\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: Hit-over-power infielder who likely settles at second base and hits about 15 homers annually\n\nYoung was a high-floor prospect in the 2021 draft as a sure-handed shortstop with an advanced lefty bat, but modest other tools. He's an OK defensive shortstop who likely ends up at second base -- and has already started playing there -- so that's where I have him projected. Young's bat-to-ball ability and pitch selection have both played a notch higher than I expected, so he should post plus on-base percentages -- something like 15 homers annually with solid defensive and baserunning value.\n\n58. Quinn Mathews, LHP, St. Louis Cardinals\n\nAge: 24 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nType: Later-blooming lefty who had a velo spike in pro ball, but still has starter qualities\n\nMathews was used heavily at Stanford -- he pitched there four seasons, racking up 224 innings in his last two years, including some eye-popping pitch counts -- and was a fourth-round pick in 2023 due to concerns tied to his usage, being 22 years old and his fastball averaging 90-93 mph.\n\nIn 2024, Mathews answered all of those concerns, getting to Triple-A and posting a better than 4-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio, helped in large part by his 93-96 mph fastball that he sustained over 143\u2153 innings. His changeup is still plus, like it was at Stanford, and now with the added arm speed, his slider is now above average. He now looks like a potential mid-rotation starter, if he can keep this up and continue to dial in his command in the upper minors.\n\n59. Harry Ford, C, Seattle Mariners\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Power-and-patience catcher who continues to come along\n\nFord was the No. 12 pick in the 2021 draft because he had a plus power potential/speed/arm combo with a shot to stay behind the plate long term (a rare combination), but some trouble sticking with the same swing. He has continued to progress behind the plate and is still a standout athlete, though his offensive upside is more driven by walks/on-base percentage than outstanding in-game power or contact rates right now (they're good, not great). As long as he stays behind the plate, that shouldn't matter much. But if he moves to a corner, his power manifesting in 20 homers annually (the raw power is still there) will become more important. For what it's worth, his government name is Harrison Michael Ford.\n\n60. George Lombard Jr., SS, New York Yankees\n\nAge: 19 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Solid-average tools, great instincts and 20-25 homer upside\n\nLombard's father, George Sr., played in the big leagues for parts of six seasons and is now the Tigers' bench coach, and his little brother Jacob is a likely 2026 first-rounder. As you might guess, Lombard has advanced feel for the game, outperforming his solid raw tools at shortstop with feel for the position, in addition to above-average pitch selection at the plate. He also stole 39 bases last year despite roughly average speed. Lombard has some real tools, as well, with raw power that's already posting major league average exit velos as a teenager.\n\nHis 2024 season line (league-average hitting across both A-ball levels) doesn't necessarily represent his full ability, as some swing/approach adjustments correcting a slow start in terms of contact seemed to show results the last month of the season.\n\n61. Caden Dana, RHP, Los Angeles Angels\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: Fastball/slider-reliant potential midrotation starter\n\nDana signed for $1.5 million out of a New Jersey high school as an 11th-round pick in the 2022 draft. The 6-foot-4 righty regularly got into the mid-90s with a sharp breaking ball and flashed starter traits at draft time, but everything he does has blossomed in his two full seasons of pro baseball to the point that he reached the big leagues last summer at age 20.\n\nHe now works at 93-95 mph with tailing life, throwing a lot of strikes with his heater. His best breaking ball is a plus slider; his curveball and changeup are both around average. Dana's next thing to figure out is making one of those secondary pitches his go-to off-speed pitch against left-handed batters.\n\n62. Brandon Sproat, RHP, New York Mets\n\nAge: 24 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Power sinker/slider starter who has continued to improve from a collegiate short reliever\n\nSproat didn't sign with the Rangers as a late-rising seventh round pick who was regularly into the mid-90s out of a Florida panhandle high school in 2019, then regularly hit 100 mph as a reliever for two years at the University of Florida. Things changed when he switched to starting in his junior year and flashed first-round potential, ultimately passing on signing with the Mets as a third-rounder in 2022. The Mets didn't give up and Sproat continued to improve, coming to terms as second-rounder in the 2023 draft.\n\nSproat's improvement continued in 2024 as he went from High-A to Triple-A, showing similarly good stuff that he showed as a starter in college: sitting in the mid-90s with sink/run, complemented by a slider, curveball and changeup that are all above average at times. He still needs one more tick of command development but now looks to be on the verge of becoming a third or fourth starter.\n\n63. Brayden Taylor, 3B, Tampa Bay Rays\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: Polished defender and hitter who has a good shot to be a solid everyday player\n\nTaylor stood out almost immediately when he got to TCU in 2021, putting up loud numbers (.315 average, 103 extra base hits, 158 walks) and eventually going No. 19 overall in the 2023 draft.\n\nHe has an incredible ability to lift and pull the ball to get to his potential average raw power, giving him 20 homer upside, but there is a concern that he's so reliant on that one way to create value that there may not be a good backup option if it doesn't work at the big league level. This concern still dogs former Rays 3B Isaac Paredes, but he also hit 70 home runs in three years once the Rays let him play everyday, so maybe they know what they're doing.\n\nTaylor is likely a .240ish hitter with a strong walk rate but adds to his value with a strong glove at third base (he can fill in at either middle infield spot, if needed), and he also stole 29 bases last season despite average speed.\n\n64. Kevin Alcantara, CF, Chicago Cubs\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Long-limbed center fielder who is tooled up and ready to develop in the big leagues\n\nAlcantara was the headliner of the Cubs' return for Anthony Rizzo in the 2021 trade deadline with the Yankees. He is a 6-foot-6 center fielder whose height becomes a factor in every part of his game. He is a plus runner and defender due in part to his long strides that provide make-up speed into the gaps. His long arms help create plus raw power but also make him a below-average hitter for contact. Those elements are pretty set, but his pitch selection and ability to pull/lift the ball to optimize his quality of contact for his power are the two unknown variables.\n\nHe had a cup of coffee with the Cubs in 2024 but is blocked by Pete Crow-Armstrong, so depending what happens with the upcoming free agency of Kyle Tucker, Alcantara's best shot at regular major league playing time could come in 2026.\n\n65. Tink Hence, RHP, St. Louis Cardinals\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Well-rounded potential midrotation starter\n\nHence was a classic projection pitcher with clean arm action when St. Louis took him No. 63 overall in the 2020 draft. He has come along slowly since, building up his innings and diversifying his pitch mix. Hence is now on the Cardinals' 40-man roster and should open 2025 in Triple-A.\n\nHis pitch velocity and movement combinations are just OK on paper, mostly around MLB average for each pitch, but his outcomes are excellent. That's typical for changeups (and Hence's is plus), which rely on a couple different kinds of deception more than aggregate movement, but I think there's something interesting going on here with Hence's six-pitch mix, deception, locations and sequencing. He's tracking like a midrotation starter.\n\n66. Starlyn Caba, SS, Miami Marlins\n\nAge: 19 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nType: An intriguing blend of outstanding contact, speed and defense but very little power\n\nCaba was traded from the Phillies to the Marlins in this offseason's Jesus Luzardo deal. He is a study in extremes: He has among the best bat control, pitch selection and defensive ability of anyone in the minor leagues, along with plus speed. As you might guess, Caba isn't that big at 5-foot-9 and has very little power (posting the second-lowest exit velocity on this list).\n\nThe bull case is that there's really only one weakness to his game, and he just turned 19 years old, so it'll improve. The bear case is this weakness could torpedo Caba's whole profile and make him a utility guy when he reaches the big leagues in a few years. I tend to be bullish on players who have one notable weakness; we saw last season that players such as Jose Iglesias, Luis Arraez or Steven Kwan can become good big leaguers.\n\n67. Ronny Mauricio, SS, New York Mets\n\nAge: 23 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nType: Dynamic raw tools, decent playability of them, coming back from a torn ACL\n\nMauricio missed the 2024 season because of a torn ACL after he'd already played 26 big league games in 2023. He should return early in the 2025 season with little difference in his scouting report, but there was still a good bit unknown about Mauricio before his knee injury.\n\nHe was one of the top prospects in his signing class and moved through the minors quickly because of his big tools, but Mauricio's feel for using those tools in games could be better. He has plus bat control and plus-plus power projection, but he undermines those with a well-above-average chase rate and a flat launch angle, so his homer totals might not match his raw power in the big leagues. Mauricio is a solid defensive shortstop and has a plus arm, so he can play anywhere on the field and could be used in a utility role to find at-bats.\n\n68. Jacob Misiorowski, RHP, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Plus-plus stuff and below-average control -- just has to find a role\n\nMisiorowski went from intriguing prep then junior college projection arm to \"have you heard about that guy sitting 100 mph?\" to \"yeah, but he doesn't know where it's going\" to \"he's a useful big leaguer, but I don't know in what role yet.\" I've had all of those conversations about him over the past few years.\n\nMisiorowski's 6-foot-7 frame helps create his arm speed but doesn't help him repeat his delivery enough to turn over a lineup at this moment. Given the success of Tyler Glasnow, you don't want to rule out anything for this type of pitcher, especially given the Brewers' success at turning lower-tier prospects into frontline starters or top relievers. Misiorowski should arrive in the big leagues during the second half of 2025, if not sooner.\n\n69. Arjun Nimmala, SS, Toronto Blue Jays\n\nAge: 19 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: A chance to be a shortstop who hits 30 homers, but it's still early\n\nOne of the most intriguing prospects in the 2022 draft because of his unique background, Nimmala's blazing-hot second half earned him a spot on this list.\n\nHe found his power in games, thanks in large part to his collection of excellent in-game power indicators (barrel rate, air pull percentage, launch angle, contact position, etc.) that should allow him to maximize his power as he develops. That will come with some swing and miss, maybe a .240 batting average and fringe-average on-base percentage, but he'll play the infield and this collection of tools and soft skills as an 18-year-old (he turned 19 after the season ended) puts Nimmala alongside the top prep prospects in the past few drafts, particularly if he can post numbers for all of 2025 like he did in the second half of 2024.\n\n70. Zyhir Hope, CF, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nType: One of the biggest breakouts of 2024 with 30-homer potential and plus speed\n\nHope was a notable prep prospect in the 2023 draft but was seen as a power/speed combo without much refinement, which is why the Cubs were able to sign him for $400,000 in the 11th round. The Cubs dealt him and Jackson Ferris, ranked No. 93, for Michael Busch last winter, and Hope proceeded to have a breakout season, with a .905 OPS at the Low-A level as a teenager followed by a solid showing in the Arizona Fall League.\n\nHope is a compactly built 5-foot-10 with plus speed (though he likely settles in a corner outfield spot) and plus-plus raw power projection. The surprising thing since the draft is Hope's ability to drive the ball in the air to all fields, particularly pitches on the inner half. There is some risk that his contact rates will dive against more advanced pitching, but the in-game power appears to be very real.\n\n71. Xavier Isaac, 1B, Tampa Bay Rays\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Left | Throws: Left\n\nType: Big, lefty-hitting first baseman with 40-homer potential but also contact issues\n\nIsaac was a surprise first-round pick in 2022, going No. 29 after missing the entire summer showcase circuit because of an injury, so teams had even more varied opinions than they normally do about prep prospects. There were a handful of teams that had Isaac lined up in the dozen picks behind where Tampa Bay took him.\n\nHe has been productive since signing, posting a nearly .900 OPS and hitting 37 homers in two pro seasons while being young for each level he has played. The concerns are that he offers almost no baserunning or defensive value, and his contact rates were much lower in 2024 than 2023, suggesting he's a .230ish or even .220 hitter at the big league level. Isaac's offensive adjustments will likely be visible in even his surface stats this upcoming season at Double-A, and that will tell us a lot about what kind of big leaguer he will be.\n\n72. Termarr Johnson, 2B, Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: A top-five pick who is starting to figure it out, might still hit 20-25 homers\n\nJohnson was the No. 4 pick in the 2022 draft, selected out of an Atlanta-area high school after a long track record of success in top prep events. He had a mixed start to his pro career, hitting a combined .240 over his first two full pro seasons with an extreme late-count, power-and-patience approach at times.\n\nIn Johnson's past 40 or so games in High-A last season, his numbers turned around as he seemed to solve some health questions while making swing adjustments. A strong 2025 season at Double-A will go a long way toward showing whether he can reach his pre-draft projections.\n\n73. Cam Smith, 3B, Houston Astros\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: 30-plus homer potential in a third base/right field tweener profile\n\nSmith was a fall 2021 pop-up prospect as a Florida high schooler with big tools who hadn't seen much velocity before. His bonus price outpaced the second- to third-round grades teams had on him, so he went to Florida State where he had a lot of contact problems as a freshman. Then in his sophomore year, he implemented a much shorter, simpler swing that changed everything. He would still show plus or more raw power in BP, with strong exit velocity, pitch selection and contact rate in games. He's OK at third base but runs and throws well enough that he could be a solid right fielder if third doesn't work out.\n\nBefore the draft, a lot of scouts who are very sharp about swings were telling me that Smith's swing was too forced and stiff, with no rhythm. Essentially, it was designed to hit college arms but not those in the upper minors or big leagues, so the team that drafts him might have to move it back to closer to what he did as a freshman, which wasn't that successful.\n\nCounter to all of that pre-draft conversation, Smith went ballistic after signing as the 14th pick, with a 1.004 OPS in 32 pro games, then was included in the Kyle Tucker deal this winter. Clearly, the swing is working better in pro ball than I expected it to, but spending a whole season facing pitchers in the upper minors this season will be a real test for how well he can make adjustments when the time comes.\n\n74. Jaison Chourio, CF, Cleveland Guardians\n\nAge: 19 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nType: Yep, Jackson's little brother can really hit and is a center/left field tweener\n\nChourio signed for $1.5 million out of Venezuela in the 2022 international signing period. He performed well, with excellent feel for the strike zone, in his first two seasons in the foreign and domestic complex leagues, then popped into top-100 consideration when he played at Low-A in 2024 before he broke his wrist toward the end of the season.\n\nHe is an average runner who stole 44 bases last year and plays mostly center field, but we'll see if he improves enough to stay there. At the plate, Chourio is borderline plus at both pitch selection and bat-to-ball ability with 20ish-homer upside. That kind of production really plays in center but is more of a low-end regular in a corner spot.\n\n75. Christian Moore, 2B, Los Angeles Angels\n\nAge: 22 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Power-over-hit everyday second baseman\n\nMoore was a solid prospect in the 2021 draft out of high school but really blossomed at Tennessee, particularly in his final two seasons when he belted 51 home runs. The Angels took him at No. 8 last summer, and he immediately got to Double-A, putting up big numbers with rumors of a big league call-up interrupted by a knee injury.\n\nMoore hunts for pitches to do damage with, so he gets to much of his plus raw power in games, but he might end up running below-average contact rates and on-base percentages.\n\n76. Chase Petty, RHP, Cincinnati Reds\n\nAge: 21 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Prep fireballer now turning into a sinker/sweeper starting pitcher\n\nPetty was a relative surprise as the No. 26 pick in the 2021 draft, coming from a New Jersey high school with some fame because he'd hit 100 mph for much of the preceding year. There's a long and not very successful list of triple-digit high school arms -- being velocity-dependent and adding stress on an arm at that important developmental stage generally aren't good future indicators.\n\nPetty pivoted well in pro ball, sitting 93-96 mph with his sinker, developing his nascent changeup and leaning his slider toward a sweeper shape. All three pitches are now flashing above-average potential, his control and command are also getting close to big league rotation quality. He should open 2025 in Triple-A and is on track to join the rotation in 2026.\n\n77. Felnin Celesten, SS, Seattle Mariners\n\nAge: 19 | Bats: Switch | Throws: Right\n\nType: Hyped international signing who has played only 32 pro games, but the tools are real\n\nMost scouts thought Celesten was the second- or third-best player in the 2023 international signing class, behind Ethan Salas. A hamstring injury delayed his pro debut to 2024 then a hamate injury ended his 2024 domestic season. There are some similarities to Leodalis De Vries, ranked No. 15, as top international signees who are developing strength quickly and may eventually move off of shortstop, but their innate hitting ability stands out wherever they move.\n\nCelesten hasn't proved that much in regular-season games, but he's on this list because he's tracking like a middle infielder who will hit 20-plus homers in the big leagues and also do other stuff well. He can fill in those blanks more definitively after a strong 2025 season at Low-A.\n\n78. Travis Sykora, RHP, Washington Nationals\n\nAge: 20 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: 6-foot-6 power righty with a middle-of-the-rotation look after one pro season\n\nSykora popped early in his prep career, hitting the mid-90s as a sophomore and holding his high-octane stuff to his senior year, landing a $2.6 million bonus from the Nats in the 2023 draft. I was bearish at draft time as I thought his velo had maxed out and he lacked the kind of starter traits needed to justify that kind of bonus. So far, I've been wrong.\n\nHe made 20 starts in Low-A last year and, while his velo/shapes on paper are just OK, he looks like a midrotation starter to the eye with outcomes also along those lines. Analysts will be interested to see if his whiff rates hold up in the upper minors or if there's simply something they're missing right now. I've decided to get on board before we find out.\n\n79. Bryce Rainer, SS, Detroit Tigers\n\nAge: 19 | Bats: Left | Throws: Right\n\nType: 6-foot-3 potential star shortstop but there are some hit-tool questions\n\nRainer was a well-known high schooler years before he was draft-eligible, getting into the mid-90s with a sharp breaking ball early in his prep career, but standing out the most as a lefty-hitting shortstop with plus raw power. He was considered a late-first-rounder or second-rounder after the summer showcase season due to his contact rate questions, but looked so impressive last spring, including against high-end competition, that some scouts thought he was a notably better hitter than in the summer.\n\nHe has the raw power for 25-30 homers and the tools to stick at shortstop, giving some Corey Seager vibes. Summer performance is the single best indicator for professional performance, so Rainer's pro debut is eagerly awaited.\n\n80. Emil Morales, SS, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nAge: 18 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: 6-foot-3 teenaged shortstop with 25-plus homer potential but contact and position questions\n\nMorales signed for $1.9 million in last year's international signing class with scouting buzz that he may have been worth at least double that bonus by the time he signed. Like many top international signees, Morales is a longer-levered hitter with big raw power and a physical projection, but those qualities also make contact and sticking at shortstop long-term a challenge, balancing strength and quickness. He had a fantastic pro debut, hitting 14 homers and posting a 1.168 OPS in 46 games with almost as many walks as strikeouts in the Dominican Summer League, but his whiff rate at the lowest level of the minors is a yellow flag for most evaluators. In 2025 or 2026, when Morales gets an extended look at Low-A, we'll see if he makes the necessary adjustments to stay on this list; there's a really high variance to where he lands on next year's list.\n\n81. Konnor Griffin, SS, Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nAge: 18 | Bats: Right | Throws: Right\n\nType: Potential star who is plus at almost everything, but some scouts worry about his swing\n\nI wrote at length about Griffin's unique two-way upside going into the draft.\n\nHe was taken with the No. 9 pick last summer as a positional player who gave me Fernando Tatis Jr. vibes, but he was also a potential top-50 pick as a pitcher with Jack Flaherty vibes.\n\nThe risk is that Griffin's swing, despite his ample tools, isn't conducive to a high-contact rate in pro ball. So his 30-homer upside, plus-plus speed and shortstop/outfield defensive projection would have to carry the value or he would maybe even turn to the mound. He hasn't played a pro game yet and from the performance data we do have, like the summer showcase circuit, he had a solid contact rate. There's a belief in the industry that Griffin may be a slower climber through the minors as he makes offensive adjustments, but the potential for a superstar is there.",
