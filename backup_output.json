    "authors": ["The Hindu Bureau"],
    "raw_text": "With folk artistes performing a range of cultural events, the much-awaited 11-day ‘Porunai Book Fair 2025’ got off to a colourful start here on Friday.\n\nWriter Vannadasan inaugurated the book fair at Tirunelveli Trade Centre in the presence of District Collector K. P. Karthikeyan, Vice-Chancellor of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University N. Chandrasekar, District Revenue Officer M. Suganya, Sub- Collector, Cheranmahadevi, Arpit Jain, MLAs M. Abdul Wahab and Ruby R. Manoharan, Mayor of Tirunelveli Corporation G. Ramakrishnan and Deputy Mayor K. R. Raju.\n\nPresiding over the function, Dr. Karthikeyan said the highlight of the ‘Porunai Book Fair 2025’ is the release of ‘Nellai Seemaiyin Oru Noottraandu Kavithaigal, Katturaigal’ compilation of stories penned by school students (‘Kathai Solla Porom’) and teachers (‘Ungaludan Ainthu Nimidam’), who are in-charge of ‘Anbaadum Mundril’ programme which was introduced in the schools for promoting harmony among school children.\n\nSince this region is known for its contribution for ancient civilization, freedom struggle, literature, culture etc., the book fair would highlight these features. After playing major role in the ancient era, the district’s contributions in science and technology were also immense as the liquid propulsions being synthesised at Indian Space Research Organisation’s facility at Mahendragiri were being used for powering the rockets.\n\nThe wind energy being generated by the windmills of the district had taken Tirunelveli to the top position in the State for generating green power. India’s largest photovoltaic cells and modules for solar power generating units had come-up at Gangaikondan on Tirunelveli outskirts to give employment to over 2,000 persons including 1,200 women from this region.\n\n“Since Tirunelveli has contributed to ancient civilisation and also for the development of science and technology, all these aspects have been exhibited in the fair in the forms of books, models and artefacts so that the visitors can understand the importance of the district,” Dr. Karthikeyan said.\n\nDebates, concerts, poetry sessions and lectures by writers will be conducted everyday at Tirunelveli Trade Centre from 7.30 p.m. onwards as part of the book fair. Cultural competitions for the students, training sessions by rural artisans, sculpture sessions for differently-abled by artist Chandru, workshops for budding journalists etc. will also be conducted. The readers can interact with the writers during the sessions to be organised this year.\n\nAs the ‘Porunai Vaasagar Vattam’ (Porunai Reaers’ Circle) has been established in every college in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari districts to nurture the literary skills of the students by conducting competitions, these students are the ‘Master of Ceremonies’ for all the events to be held during the ‘Porunai Festival 2025’.\n\nGift vouchers worth about ₹15 lakh are given to students for buying books in the book fair, in which the drawings of students from the four southern districts and exhibits from INS Kattabomman, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project and Indian Space Research Organisation’s Propulsion Research Centre, artefacts, natural farm products, artificial intelligence products etc. have been displayed.\n\nPublishers have displayed their books in 124 stalls in the fair which also offer traditional sweets and savouries to the visitors. A stall has been dedicated for training the students on making handicrafts and women self-help groups have put-up their stalls for selling their products.\n\nDeputy Inspector General of Police, Tirunelveli Range, Pa. Moorthy presided over the function held in the evening.",

All disgruntled leaders and their issues will find their answers after the elections to the post. The party national leadership has appointed Union Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to oversee the elections to the post and he will shortly visit the State,” he told mediamen at Sedam in Kalaburagi district on Friday.\n\nHe was there to participate in the seventh edition of Bharatiya Samskruti Utsav.\n\nWhen asked about the charge that only a few dominant castes are prioritised in the appointments of presidents for the party’s district units, Mr. Vijayendra said that building a party is not possible without the involvement of all communities.\n\n“As per the party rule, the appointment of presidents for at least 50% of the district organising units should be completed before the elections to the post of president of the State unit. There are 39 organising committees in the State and the appointments of presidents for 25 of them have been completed. Party organisation is not possible if we depend on a couple of castes. We will have to take people of all communities along with us,” he said.",

Sivaguru Prabakaran outlined the project’s implementation and its advantages over the conventional water supply system.\n\n“Coimbatore Corporation sources drinking water from the Siruvani and Pilloor reservoirs, treating it with chlorine at a minimum of 0.2 PPM to prevent contamination. While there is a probability of contamination in conventional supply systems, the 24x7 pressurised water supply system will eliminate these issues and provide residents with safe drinking water directly from their taps, reducing reliance on filtration or packaged water. It also enables households to extend their house service connection (HSC) directly to their kitchen and overhead tanks up to seven metres in height, removing the need for a sump and motor,” he said.\n\nHe highlighted key features of the system, including GIS-based mapping with high-resolution satellite images, detailed water network mapping, and GIS-based hydraulic modelling.\n\nOver 150 officials from 14 States, representing various local bodies, attended the workshop to learn from Coimbatore’s model and explore ways to implement similar water supply systems in their regions. They also visited control centres, households, and other facilities to gain a deeper understanding of the system’s operations.",

The annual festival, also known as Surya Jayanti festival locally, is expected to attract 2-3 lakh devotees.\n\nAccording to TTD Chairman B.R. Naidu, strict security measures have been taken to prevent any untoward incidents. It may be recalled that a stampede in Tirupati on January 8 killed six persons and injured over twenty.\n\nBriefing the media after a board meeting at Annamayya bhavan here on Friday (January 31), he said the festivities would take off with the pre-dawn Surya Prabha Vahanam between 5:30 a.m. and 8 a.m. and conclude with the Chandra Prabha Vahanam between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. at night.\n\nOther significant processions include the Garuda Vahanam at 11 a.m., Hanumantha Vahanam at 1 p.m., Chakrasnanam at 2 p.m., Kalpavriksha at 4 p.m., and Sarva Bhupala Vahanam at 6 p.m.\n\nAs a precautionary move, several arjitha sevas like Astadalam, Kalyanotsavam, Unjal, Brahmotsavams and Sahasra Deepalankara sevas as well as all formats of privileged darshans such as those extended to the NRIs, parents with infants and senior and special citizens have been cancelled in anticipation of heavy crowds.\n\nThere would be no issuance of Slotted Sarva Darshan (SSD) tokens from February 3 to 5, and devotees with Special Entry Darshan (SED) tickets must report at Vaikuntam Queue Complex at their designated time.\n\nTo ensure security, 1,250 police personnel and 1,000 vigilance staff would be deployed, along with personnel from Octopus, APSP, fire services and traffic control teams. Emergency gates and designated entry and exit routes would be in place at the gallery areas. NDRF and expert swimmers would be stationed at Pushkarini for Chakrasnanam.\n\nTemporary shelters have been set up along the mada streets for the convenience of the devotees. Supply of drinking water and food, sanitation measures and medical and ambulance services have also been arranged.",

    "authors": ["Hemanth C.S", "Hemanth  C.S"],
    "raw_text": "A new study has found that the tiger population in India has increased by 30% over the past two decades.\n\nThe study, which has been published in Science, was led by Senior Scientist Yadvendradev Jhala and colleagues. It has explored the socio-ecological factors that have enabled tiger recovery and persistence despite high human densities and economic challenges amid rapid urbanisation.\n\nMeticulous balance\n\n“They have found that the tiger population in India has increased by 30% over the past two decades. This demonstrates the remarkable success achieved through a meticulous balance of scientific strategies and a strategic blend of land-sharing and land-sparing,” the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) said.\n\nIt further added that despite harbouring the highest human population residing in economically diverse regions, India has achieved significant success in conserving wildlife, even as global wildlife populations have declined by 73%.\n\n“Protected areas, devoid of humans, through land sparing have allowed sustenance of 85% of breeding populations. These source populations facilitated through corridors and sustainable land-use practices have enabled tigers to disperse and expand into multi-use forests. Tigers now coexist with over 66 million people, proving coexistence possible,” said Mr. Jhala.\n\nLegislative framework\n\nThe study stated that India’s tiger recovery has strengthened due to a strong legislative framework, including the Wildlife Protection Act, Forest Conservation Act, and the National Tiger Conservation Authority.\n\n“Beyond ecological factors, economic prosperity and cultural values have influenced tiger persistence, recovery and colonisation. Regions with lower dependence on forest resources and better socio-economic conditions have witnessed higher tiger recolonisation rates. Conversely, areas with high poverty, and armed conflict such as in Naxal-affected parts of Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand—have experienced tiger decline,” it added.\n\nFuture direction\n\nOn challenges and future directions, the scientists also have key recommendations which include, expanding protected areas and habitat corridors, strengthening anti-poaching measures, promoting sustainable livelihoods for communities living near tiger habitats,enhancing human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies, including early warning systems and rapid response teams.\n\n“While India’s tiger recovery is an extraordinary achievement, challenges remain. Large tracts of potential tiger habitat — spanning 157,000 sq km — are still devoid of tigers due to socio-political instability and habitat degradation,” it said.",

    "authors": [],
    "raw_text": "Investigators on Thursday (January 30, 2025) recovered the black boxes from a passenger plane whose mid-air collision with a military helicopter over Washington's Potomac river killed 67 people, as rescuers pulled victims' bodies from the freezing water.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump launched a political attack blaming diversity and inclusion policies championed by his Democratic predecessors for causing the incident.\n\nMr. Trump's politicization of the tragedy came as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it had recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the Bombardier jet operated by an American Airlines subsidiary that smashed into an Army Black Hawk helicopter late Wednesday.\n\n\"The recorders are at the NTSB labs for evaluation,\" the agency said in a statement to AFP.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, staffing was thin in the control tower at Reagan National Airport, where the airliner was about to land when the collision occurred.\n\nOne controller, rather than the usual two, was handling both plane and helicopter traffic, the Times quoted a preliminary Federal Aviation Administration report as saying.\n\nA fireball erupted in the night sky and both aircraft tumbled into the icy Potomac, leaving rescue crews with the grim, difficult task of searching for bodies in the dark and cold.\n\nOver 40 bodies had been recovered as of Thursday evening, according to US media reports.\n\nTrump politicizes crash\n\nMr. Trump, who took office 10 days ago, turned a press conference on the disaster into a platform for his crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion or DEI -- a series of often decades-old measures meant to combat racism and sexism across the United States.\n\nAccusing his Democratic predecessors Joe Biden and Barack Obama of having kept good employees out of the aviation agency in pursuit of DEI, he claimed: \"They actually came out with a directive: 'too white.' And we want the people that are competent.\"\n\nThe passenger plane was carrying 64 people and the Black Hawk had three aboard.\n\nThe collision -- the first major crash in the United States since 2009 when 49 people were killed near Buffalo, New York -- occurred as American Eagle Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas came in to land.\n\nReagan National is a major airport located a short distance from downtown Washington, the White House and the Pentagon. The airspace is extremely busy, with civilian and military aircraft a constant presence.\n\nMr. Trump opened his White House press conference by speaking of the nation's anguish.\n\nHowever, he then launched into an extended broadside against DEI, aiming directly at Biden's openly gay transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\"He's run it right into the ground with his diversity,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe message was hammered home as Mr. Trump's vice president, JD Vance, and new defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, took turns at the podium to repeat -- without evidence -- the hard-right theory that diversity measures keep capable Americans out of responsible jobs.\n\nAsked again by reporters whether he was blaming workplace diversity for the crash, Trump answered: \"It could have been.\"\n\nButtigieg responded on X, calling Mr. Trump \"despicable.\"\n\n\"As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy posted that Trump's comments \"blaming the FAA's hiring of women and black people for the crash -- was disgusting.\"\n\n\"He's in charge. This happened on his watch,\" Murphy said.\n\nTrump doubled down, however, later issuing an official memo directing the government to investigate \"deterioration in hiring standards\" under Biden and \"replacement\" of anyone unqualified.\n\nSkaters among victims\n\nAmong those on the airliner were several US skaters and coaches, US Figure Skating said. Officials in Moscow also confirmed the presence of Russian couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won the 1994 world pairs title.\n\nTwo Chinese citizens were also among the victims of the crash, state news agency Xinhua reported Friday in Beijing, citing the Chinese embassy.\n\nThe force of the collision soon made it clear that survivors were unlikely.\n\n\"I just saw a fireball and it was gone,\" one air traffic controller was heard telling a colleague after communication with the helicopter was cut.\n\nTransport officials said both aircraft were on standard flight patterns on a clear night with good visibility.\n\nAnd Hegseth said the chopper had \"a fairly experienced crew that was doing a required annual night evaluation.\"",

    "title": "Editor’s Note | Vaishna Roy Writes: Why the Waqf Bill Reforms Cannot Do Without a Consultative Approach",
    "authors": ["Vaishna Roy"],
    "raw_text": "The return of Donald Trump to the White House shows how demagogues the world over are successfully convincing large swathes of voters that their continuing post-pandemic distress will vanish magically if they get rid of that one evil enemy. Trump identified this enemy as illegal immigrants and others whom he ominously called “the enemy within”, which seems to be the American equivalent of the “urban naxal”.\n\nIf Israel and India have both created models of virulent masculinity, as Martha Nussbaum wrote, this is derived from the sense of eternal victimhood that Zionist and Hindutva fundamentalists share, and both direct their aggression at Muslims, whom the Christian colonial project had already conveniently vilified.\n\nSince 2014, a series of measures has sought to demonise India’s Muslim community—the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, the criminalisation of triple talaq, and the various jehads from COVID and love jehad to land jehad and vote jehad. Even for the Jharkhand Assembly election campaign, the BJP has aggressively raised the bogey of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants robbing tribal lands and tribal women.\n\nThat the spotlight would soon turn on the Waqf Board was never in doubt. Hindutva warriors have always spread the jealous narrative of waqf being the largest property owner after the Railways and Army, a carefully cultivated piece of disinformation. If one considers that the Hindu religious boards in the three States of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana alone control more than 10 lakh acres of land, then the 9.4 lakh acres estimated to be under waqf falls into better perspective; even more so when you consider, as the Congress party’s Rajya Sabha MP Syed Naseer Hussain explains in his interview to Vikhar Ahmed Sayeed in this issue, that even the smallest cemetery and mosque in the country is technically waqf land.\n\nThe returns from waqf properties have always been low and not used adequately for the benefit of disadvantaged Muslims. That there is inefficiency and corruption in the management of waqf property is a fact: the 2006 Sachar Committee report had already pointed to it, as it had to the educational, social, and economic backwardness of the Muslim community.\n\nThe community has largely been shut out of India’s post-Independence social churn and mobility not only because of historical discriminations, but also because large sections turned inwards and became insular and retrogressive. As the veteran journalist Saeed Naqvi wrote in Being the Other, the average Muslim remains disadvantaged because of “his clerical leadership, which strikes bargains with the political class and keeps the community mired in religion” and “distant from modernity”.\n\nUnfortunately, the community’s overall backwardness becomes fertile ground for the right wing to piously claim that projects such as the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, are meant to “improve” their living conditions. In reality, there is reason to believe that the Bill’s motivation stems from the baser instinct to “put Muslims in their place”, an objective that has never been a secret since 2014. Just one example will suffice: The Bill wants to appoint non-Muslims to the Central Waqf Council, an inexplicable demand given that no Hindu religious endowment body allows non-Hindus in its governing councils.\n\nThere is much that real reform can achieve, but it must be consultative and come with clean hands. Unfortunately, even Jagdambika Pal, the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee set up to examine the Bill, is accused of riding roughshod over the real stakeholders.\n\nThe Muslim response to such “reforms” is captured rather well in this couplet quoted in Naqvi’s book:\n\nTurfatar yeh hai ki apna bhi na jaana\n\nAur yun hee apna apna kehke humko sabse beygana kiya.\n\n(The irony is that you never considered me your own\n\nBut you claimed me as yours until I became a stranger to everyone else.)",

    "authors": ["Soni Mishra", "Vaishna Roy", "Soni  Mishra & Vaishna Roy"],
    "raw_text": "It has been difficult to get an interview with Arvind Kejriwal. Not only is it a question of time, Kejriwal is also wary of “mainstream” media, a fact that he admits when we finally meet. After a postponement, the interview is set for 9:00 pm, and when we get to his current residence at 5 Ferozeshah Road, Kejriwal has just returned from a long day of campaigning for what is being seen as a make-or-break election for both him and his party.\n\nBut Kejriwal himself does not display any such anxiety. He enters the drawing room with a smile and a slight spring in his step, visibly tired but upbeat.\n\nAs we talk, his social media team calls every now and then, relating tweets that make him smile. He asks them to draft a quote tweet “that I will check later”. Hearing the news that Dhruv Rathee’s upload of Unbreakable, a 30-minute documentary about his arrest (whose screening was stopped by the Delhi Police), has garnered 8.5 million views on YouTube, his smile widens. “By stopping it, they achieved just the opposite,” he says.\n\nIn the freewheeling conversation that follows, Kejriwal says that he is confident of winning Delhi a third time. According to him, people will vote his government back in because of its “kaam ki rajneeti” (politics of delivery). He adds: “Delhi is the only State with 24x7 free electricity. Have you seen government schools like ours? Or mohalla clinics?”\n\nWhen asked about the corruption charges against him, he says that if they were true, the Aam Aadmi Party would not have to resort to crowdfunding. The frequent run-ins with the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) do not appear to faze him—“we will manage”—nor do the multiple cases against him and his party members, but when he talks of his plans to counter the BJP, Kejriwal’s voice takes on an edge. Excerpts:\n\nIt has been more than a decade since you entered politics and since the AAP burst on to the Delhi political scene. What motivated you to give up a lucrative job and plunge into the uncertain world of activism and then politics?\n\nDuring my job in the income tax department, I saw how entrenched corruption had become in our system. I started Parivartan [an NGO] to fight corruption because I felt I couldn’t do much to address it as a civil servant. Eventually, I left the IRS [Indian Revenue Service] because I felt my calling was to fight injustice in all forms. I worked for a decade in the slums of Sunder Nagri. The plunge into politics happened suddenly. When the India Against Corruption [IAC] movement failed to convince politicians to pass a strong Jan Lokpal Bill, they challenged us to win elections and make our own policies. If the UPA [United Progressive Alliance] government had accepted the IAC’s demands, I would never have entered politics.\n\nHow did your wife, Sunita, and your parents react to the decision? How are they coping now with the immense public and political pressure on you?\n\nSunita and my parents have always been my biggest pillars of support. They’ve stood by me through every challenge. Last year was particularly hard for them when I was jailed for five months in a completely fake case. It was heartbreaking for them, especially when even my medicines were stopped, something no family should have to worry about. I have immense admiration for Sunita’s strength and resilience in those difficult times. She not only managed the household but also took on a huge responsibility—coordinating with party leaders and volunteers and even stepping out to make public appearances on my behalf. Her courage and determination kept our entire team motivated. My family’s unwavering support gives me the strength to continue this fight for the people.\n\nAlso Read | Delhi electoral roll faces unprecedented scrutiny amid 510,000 last-minute registration surge\n\nTell us a bit about your childhood and family. Can your activism or decision to join politics be traced to any incidents from your early years?\n\nI had a simple, middle-class upbringing in Hisar, Haryana, where I studied up to the 12th standard. Back then, I had no interest in politics or activism. Like most kids, I focussed on studies and getting into a good college. I worked hard and managed to crack IIT-JEE and secured admission to IIT Kharagpur. After graduating, I worked at Tata Steel for three years. During that time, I volunteered with an organisation in Kolkata to help those in need. That experience changed me deeply. For the first time, I understood the immense satisfaction and purpose that comes from serving others. That phase of my life planted the seeds of wanting to contribute to society in a more meaningful way.\n\nHow challenging were the five months you spent in prison? How has it changed you as a person and politician?\n\nThose five months were extremely challenging. They did everything they could to break me mentally and physically. I was kept in solitary confinement the entire time—conditions usually meant for hardened criminals. For over two weeks, they even stopped my insulin, despite knowing I am diabetic and need insulin four times a day. It was only after I approached the courts that it was resumed.\n\nIn politics, we may have opponents but not enemies. The way I was treated was nothing short of inhuman. But during those dark days, I found strength in reading the Bhagavad Gita. I read it multiple times, and it gave me immense clarity and inner peace. The prayers and support of crores of people also kept me going.\n\nThe experience has made me stronger and more determined. I knew that the truth was on my side and that sooner or later I would be free. It has reaffirmed my commitment to continue fighting for what is right, no matter the odds.\n\nWho or what has been your inspiration in your journey as an activist and later as a politician?\n\nI have been deeply inspired by the lives of many of our freedom fighters, particularly Babasaheb Ambedkar. He faced immense challenges, including poverty and discrimination, yet he dedicated his life to fighting for equality and justice. His work in drafting the Constitution has been instrumental in shaping our democracy and safeguarding the rights of every citizen. I also draw inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi and Bhagat Singh, whose courage and sacrifices for the country remain timeless examples of true leadership. Even today, I find motivation in ordinary people who work to bring change in their communities. Their determination reminds me why this fight for justice and fairness is so important.\n\nLooking back at the IAC movement of 2011, in what ways did it impact the country’s politics?\n\nThe movement gave millions of Indians a voice against the rampant corruption that had seeped into every corner of our political system. It was a turning point, where people from all walks of life came together to demand accountability and transparency from those in power.\n\nBeyond giving birth to the AAP, the IAC movement remains a powerful reminder of what ordinary citizens can achieve when they unite and raise their voices against injustice. It redefined the relationship between the people and the political system, showing that public power is stronger than any political machinery when exercised with conviction and purpose.\n\nThe IAC was your springboard into politics. Do you believe that the AAP has taken that anti-corruption narrative ahead?\n\nAbsolutely, and in multiple ways. The AAP has fundamentally challenged the old formula of “satta se paisa, paise se satta” [money from power and power from money] that traditional parties have followed for decades. We’ve proven that elections in India can be fought and won without relying on massive sums of money. For us, “kaam ki rajneeti” takes precedence.\n\nOur commitment to honesty has been central to achieving transformational changes. In Delhi, we’ve redefined what’s possible in government schools and healthcare systems. Across much of the country, politicians control the education and health mafias, ensuring that governments deliberately fail to provide good services so that even the poorest are forced to turn to expensive private options. We refused to follow that path.\n\nWe’ve also been pioneers in tackling corruption at the systemic level. We introduced doorstep delivery of government services so that people do not have to run around and face middlemen. We even shut down RTOs [regional transport offices], which had become notorious centres of corruption. These initiatives demonstrate that honest governance isn’t just an ideal—it can deliver real, tangible benefits to the people.\n\nAlso Read | Arvind Kejriwal faces toughest battle yet for New Delhi constituency\n\nYour early AAP colleagues are your bitter critics today. Why did you fall out? Would your fight be easier today if they had remained with you?\n\nWhoever left did so for their own reasons, and I respect their choices. I have only good memories of the time we spent together and the work we accomplished as a team. I genuinely wish them well and hope that, someday, they might return to join us in this journey.\n\nAt the same time, many remarkable individuals have joined the AAP over the years. Every political party evolves, and people come and go—it’s a natural process. What matters is that the mission and values we started with remain strong, and we continue to fight for the people with the same determination.\n\nThe past two and a half years have been tumultuous for your party, with the BJP relentless in its attacks. Why did it pick corruption as its weapon? Have the allegations, especially relating to the excise policy scam, damaged the image of the AAP and its leaders, including yourself?\n\nIt was clear that they targeted our greatest strength: our honesty. They aimed to create doubt in the minds of the people about the integrity of the AAP and its leaders. However, now that this episode is behind us, it has only strengthened our image. Despite hundreds of raids and all the top investigative agencies working on the case, not a single rupee of corruption was found in the so-called Delhi excise scam. Yet, several of our senior leaders were jailed, purely on baseless allegations, without trial or conviction.\n\nThis has not damaged our image; in fact, it has only generated more sympathy and support for the AAP. People see through these tactics and know that we remain committed to honesty and public service.\n\nDelhi is where the AAP began its electoral journey. You came up with the “Delhi model of governance”. What does this model stand for?\n\nThe Delhi model of governance prioritises spending on human capital the most. People are our greatest asset, and unless we provide every citizen, rich or poor, with quality education and healthcare, how can we aspire to become a developed nation?\n\nWe are the only government across India that invests nearly 40 per cent of its budget in education and health. We also believe in providing basic amenities free of cost to the “aam aadmi”, such as water, electricity, and bus travel for women. This allows them to live a life of dignity besides giving them relief from inflation. This is sound economics too because these transfers increase the purchasing power of the people and create demand in the economy. And only if there is demand, will there be growth and investment.\n\nEconomists refer to this as bottom-up or trickle-up approach. This is opposite to the failed trickle-down theory of growth being followed in our country for several decades, where governments focus spending only on rich industrialists hoping that their prosperity will trickle down to the masses.\n\nSpeaking of ideology, you have often proactively taken pro-Hinduism decisions. For example, extending the grant for imams to pujaris and granthis, the pilgrimage grant, the temple train schemes, etc. Is Kejriwal taking a right turn?\n\nIf my government is giving grants and support to people of all religions, and if I am enabling citizens to visit pilgrimage sites of their faith—be it temples, mosques, churches, or gurdwaras—why should that be seen as wrong?\n\nReligion and faith are an intrinsic part of our society, and it is the responsibility of a government to respect and support the spiritual needs of its people, irrespective of their beliefs. These initiatives are about inclusivity and ensuring that every community feels cared for and represented. Governance, in my view, is about serving people in all aspects of their lives, including their spiritual and cultural needs.\n\nAlso Read | Is AAP changing its political tactics?\n\nYou have said this is the toughest election the AAP has faced in Delhi. How do you rate your chances of victory? After 10 years in power, why will the people vote for you again?\n\nEvery election is challenging, and we approach each one with full determination. The last five years were particularly tough. The first two years were lost to the COVID-19 pandemic, and after that many of our leaders were imprisoned in fake cases. Despite these obstacles, we’ve made remarkable progress across multiple sectors.\n\nWe are confident of victory because of the transformation we’ve brought to the lives of Delhi’s people. Government schools have been completely overhauled and are now performing better than many private schools. Our mohalla clinics are serving two crore patients annually. Delhi is the only State in the country with 24x7 free electricity. We’ve also doubled the length of the Delhi Metro and added 2,000 electric buses—the highest in India.\n\nThe people of Delhi will vote for us because of these achievements and because they know we are committed to their welfare and progress.\n\nEven if you win, how are you going to do effective work if the L-G continues to control the bureaucracy? And, if you do come back to power, what is the one big administrative reform you wish to implement in Delhi?\n\nIt’s unfortunate that the BJP-led Centre seems to think that its primary role in Delhi is to derail the work of the elected government. Politics should be about competing to serve the people, not pulling each other down. The Centre has so many powers in Delhi—they could have built schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, and worked to reduce crime. Yet, they’ve failed to deliver even a single meaningful contribution to the people of Delhi.\n\nIn our next term, one major infrastructural reform will be to redesign 1,400 km of Delhi’s major roads to European standards, giving the city the look and feel of a global metropolis. We’ve already successfully piloted around 40 km of roads along these lines, and the results have been highly encouraging.\n\nCan you become Chief Minister if the AAP wins? Do the Supreme Court’s bail conditions allow you to do so?\n\nThis is just another fake narrative being spread by the opposition because they cannot counter us on the work we’ve done, nor do they have a credible chief ministerial face for Delhi. Let me make it clear: the Supreme Court has not imposed any bar on me becoming the Chief Minister again.\n\nBesides corruption, the other big plank this time is the AAP’s financial viability. Your opponents say you do not have a plan to fund the Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana.\n\nSimilar doubts were raised when we introduced free electricity, water, and bus rides for women. Yet, not only are these schemes running successfully, we’re also the only State government to maintain a surplus budget for the past 10 years. I have a detailed plan to fund every guarantee I have made for the next five years, including the Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana.\n\nThe BJP has no chief ministerial face. Is this election a Modi vs Kejriwal contest? If so, will this work for you or against you?\n\nModiji is the Prime Minister of the country, so it cannot be a Modi vs Kejriwal contest in Delhi. I have repeatedly asked the BJP to declare its chief ministerial face, but instead of answering, they resort to verbal abuses.\n\nFor the people of Delhi, the choice is clear: it’s between Kejriwal, who has a track record of delivering results, and a party that relies on “gaali-galauj” [abuses] instead of presenting a vision for the city. I trust the voters of Delhi to make the right decision.\n\nAlso Read | Trickle-up economics and AAP’s ‘Delhi Model’\n\nThe RSS is reportedly using its massive cadre base to reach out to your traditional voter base in the slums and migrant worker colonies. Can the AAP counter this?\n\nIn a democracy, everyone is free to contest elections and seek votes. But the people of Delhi are wise—they know who has genuinely cared for them and worked to improve their lives. Ultimately, it is their decision, and I have full faith in their ability to choose what’s best for them and the future of Delhi.\n\nThe AAP has alleged large-scale voter additions and deletions in the electoral list. If the Election Commission does not respond satisfactorily to your complaints, what will your plan of action be?\n\nThis is not just an allegation—we have provided substantial evidence to the Election Commission and the media, showing how the BJP is attempting to manipulate voter lists in this election.\n\nFor instance, in my own New Delhi constituency, where there are around 1 lakh voters, we found that within just 15 days in December, 14,000 new voter applications were filed, and 6,000 voters were marked for deletion. If 20 per cent of voters in a constituency can be altered so easily, it raises serious questions about the integrity of the election process.\n\nWhat’s more troubling is that when the Election Commission contacted individuals who allegedly requested voter deletions, those who responded said they had never filed such applications—it was a clear case of identity theft. Despite these red flags, the Election Commission has neither launched an investigation nor stopped processing these fraudulent [deletion] applications.\n\nWe’ve raised the issue repeatedly and been assured that the Election Commission will address it and prevent any manipulation. For now, we are closely monitoring the situation and mobilising our volunteers on the ground to ensure that every voter’s right is protected. If the Election Commission fails to act, we will leave no stone unturned in raising this issue before the people and ensuring fair elections.\n\nWhat are the national implications of this election? With the Trinamool Congress and the Samajwadi Party supporting the AAP, what is the future of the INDIA front? Do you believe the Congress should no longer helm the anti-BJP alliance?\n\nI am deeply grateful to Mamata [Banerjee] didi, Akhileshji [Yadav], and other leaders for their support. They recognise that the alliance’s primary goal is to defeat the BJP and protect the country’s democratic values. In every State, the party best positioned to challenge the BJP should take the lead, and this principle must guide us moving forward.\n\nI am fighting this election to save the country, while it seems the Congress is fighting to save itself. The future of the INDIA alliance will be decided collectively by its leadership. It is this shared vision and unity that will ensure we achieve our larger goal of securing the country’s future.\n\nAfter two huge mandates—67 of 70 seats in 2015 and 62 of 70 in 2020—how many seats do you expect to win this time?\n\nThat’s for the voters of Delhi to decide. Wherever I go, people tell me they believe the AAP will form the government again with a comfortable majority. The exact margin may vary, but the support and trust of the people remain strong, and that’s what truly matters.\n\nFinally, what legacy does Arvind Kejriwal wish to leave behind?\n\nI consider it a blessing and a privilege to have been chosen as Chief Minister three times—something I had never even imagined. My only focus is to use every moment of this opportunity to serve the people and contribute to building a better, stronger India.",

    "authors": ["The Hindu Bureau"],
    "raw_text": "As part of the obituary references, Speaker Om Birla expressed condolences on the deaths of 30 devotees during the ongoing Maha Kumbh festivities in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj.\n\nThe house observed a minute of silence as a mark of respect.\n\nSpeaker Om Birla commences Lok Sabha proceedings. He makes references to the demise of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and the former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.\n\nMr. Birla also expresses condolences on the demise of former Parliamentarians Kunar Hembram, Hassan Khan, Dr. Manda Jagannath, and P.R. Sundaram.\n\nThe government’s third term is seeing work being done at thrice the speed of previous administrations with a determination to end “policy paralysis”, President Droupadi Murmu said on Friday (January 31, 2025), citing decisions on issues such as Waqf boards and One Nation, One Election.\n\nClick here to read more on President Murmu’s joint address to Parliament\n\nVice President Jagdeep Dhankhar moves to read some parts of the President’s address in English. When he reads out the condolence message for victims of the Maha Kumbh stampede, certain members of the Opposition raise their voices in protest.\n\nLet us once again reiterate the resolve of unity, and be committed to fulfilling India’s dreams, says President Murmu\n\n“When we grow together, our future generations will definitely see a developed, strong, capable and prosperous India in 2047,” Ms. Murmu adds while concluding her address.\n\n“In a time of global instability, India is presenting an example to the world by becoming a pillar of economic, social and political stability. Be it G7 Summit, Quad, BRICS, SCO or G20, the whole world has expressed confidence in India’s capabilities, policies and intentions,” President Murmu says.\n\nThe government has taken historic actions to protect the country’s borders and ensure internal security. We have got very encouraging results especially in self-reliance in the defence sector.\n\nWe have moved from ‘Make in India’ to ‘Make for the World’. Due to this, new employment opportunities are also being created in the country.\n\nAlong with protecting the borders, development of the border areas of the country is also an important part of our strategy. Border area roads and modern infrastructure like Atal Tunnel, Sela Tunnel, Sonamarg Tunnel have given a boost to defence and tourism.\n\n“For the development of India, my government has created three such strong pillars of Reform, Perform and Transform. Today these words have become synonymous with India’s new governance model all over the world,” President Murmu says\n\n“PM Suraj Yojana has been expanded to provide easy loans to the backward sections of the society and sanitation workers. To extend the benefits of government schemes to the disabled people, more than one crore disablity identity cards have been issued.”\n\n“Our manuscripts are our heritage. They contain vast knowledge that needs to be studied, researched and used for the benefit of mankind. Digitization and conservation of manuscripts using advanced technology is being taken up on mission mode.”\n\n“In order to enable the entire country to see the potential of the eight States of the North East, the first Ashtalakshmi Mahotsav was organised.” President Murmu says.\n\nAlong with the development of the North-East, the government has started working on the action plan for “Purvodaya” i.e. all-round development of the eastern States of the country, which will also provide new employment opportunities.\n\nAs a result of various steps taken for the economic empowerment of the cooperative sector, many employment opportunities are being created, President Murmu says.\n\nThe year 2025 is being celebrated as the Year of International Cooperation, in which India will make an important contribution, she adds.\n\n“My government has given first priority to the welfare of our tribal communities, which continued to be neglected even after decades of independence. ‘Dharti Aaba Tribal Village Utkarsh Abhiyan’ and ‘PM-Janman Yojana’ are direct examples of this. Health problems related to sickle cell of the tribal community are also being addressed by running a special national mission. About five crore persons have been screened under this mission.”\n\nSaying that the goal of the govt is to have a modern and self-reliant agricultural system in India, President Murmu adds: My government is working dedicatedly to provide fair prices to the farmers for their crops and to increase their income.\n\nFor a weather ready and climate smart India, my government has started “Mission Mausam” at a cost of Rs 2,000 crore, which will also benefit our farmers.\n\nPresident Murmu, in her joint address to the Parliament, speaks on the intersections of digital and health sectors. She says: U-WIN portal has been launched to keep accurate tracking of the vaccination schedule of pregnant women and children. So far, about thirty crore vaccine doses have been registered on this portal.\n\nCitizens have got health benefits through more than 30 crore e-tele-consultations through telemedicine.\n\nUdhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link Project has been completed and now the country will be connected from Kashmir to Kanyakumari by railway line. Under this ambitious project, Chenab Bridge has been constructed, which is the highest railway bridge in the world, Ms. Murmu said.\n\nIndia’s metro network has now crossed the milestone of one thousand kilometers. India has now become the third largest country in the world in terms of metro network.\n\nIn our rapidly digitizing society, another important topic related to national security is cyber security. Technologies like digital fraud, cyber crime and deep fake have also become a challenge to social, economic and national security, President Murmu says. Many steps have been taken to control these cyber crimes.\n\nThere are employment opportunities for youth in the field of cyber security also, Ms. Murmu adds.\n\nPresident Murmu highlights the expansion of banking services, penetration of digital payment services, and introduction of 5G services in the country. She says:\n\nFor decades, the brothers and sisters of our country who made their living by setting up shops on the street vendors remained out of the banking system. Today he is getting the benefit of PM Swanidhi Yojana. On the basis of digital transaction records, they get more loans to expand their business.\n\nToday India is making its presence felt as a major global player in the field of digital technology. The introduction of 5G services in India is a big example of this.\n\nMy government has used digital technology as a tool for social justice and equality. Digital payment is not limited to some people or some classes. Even the smallest shopkeeper in India is taking advantage of this facility.\n\nIn her joint address to the Parliament, Ms. Murmu turns her focus towards discussing the govt’s plan for AI in India. She says:\n\nTaking forward India’s contribution in the field of Artificial Intelligence, “India AI Mission” has been started.\n\nWith the National Quantum Mission, India will be able to take a place among the leading countries of the world in this frontier technology.\n\nThe stability and resilience that the Indian economy has shown despite global concerns like Covid and its aftermath and war is proof of its strength.\n\nMy government has taken many important steps to promote ease of doing business.\n\nToday our youth is bringing glory to the country in every field from startups, sports to space. Through MY Bharat portal, lakhs of youth are getting involved in the work of nation building, Ms. Murmu says.\n\nMy government is preparing a modern education system for the students through the National Education Policy. No one should be deprived of education, that is why opportunities for education in mother tongue are being provided. Language barriers have also been overcome by conducting various recruitment examinations in thirteen Indian languages, she adds.\n\nIndian teams have performed well everywhere, be it the Olympics or Paralympics.

More than ten crore women of the country have been connected with it. A total amount of more than Rs 9 lakh crore has been distributed to them through bank linkage.\n\nOur Banking and Digi Payment Sakhis are playing an important role in connecting people in remote areas with the financial system.

    "raw_text": "The wait is over, folks! The play has been suspended for the day. We will start half an hour early on Sunday.\n\nWe will be back with more action on Day 4.\n\nThe latest images from the ground show the pitch under covers. The crowd too has dispersed now.\n\nIND vs AUS, 4th Test: Nitish, Washington register second-highest 8th-wicket partnership for India in Australia\n\nNitish and Washington got together at 221 for seven when Nathan Lyon pinned Ravindra Jadeja in front with the side still in a deficit of 253 runs.\n\nThe match has been stopped due to bad light. It is not Stumps yet. But we doubt the players will be back given the stoppage comes this late in the day.\n\nNitish facing Lyon, four riders at the boundary on the on side. He gets a single on the third delivery. Siraj gets an edge past slip and runs two.\n\nIND vs AUS, 4th Test: Nitish Kumar Reddy scores maiden hundred\n\nIndia batter Nitish Kumar Reddy scored his maiden Test hundred on Saturday during the third day of the fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne.\n\nBoland to Nitish. Defends the first delivery on the off stump line. The second nips in and hits him on the back foot. FOUR! Nitish picks this over mid on and that’s his hundred. The MCG is up on its feet. What a moment for the 21-year-old. He has his father watching in the stands.\n\nHe gets a single on the fifth and Siraj plays the final delivery out.\n\nCummins back into the attack. Jasprit Bumrah on strike. Starts with a bouncer, Bumrah ducks. WICKET! Bumrah is caught at first slip.\n\nJasprit Bumrah c Khawaja b Cummins 0(3)\n\nMohammed Siraj is the final man. He has three deliveries to survive with Nitish on 99. He does it, gets through the final three deliveries.\n\nBoland to Nitish. Drives the first delivery to mid on, denies a single. Looks like he has decided to farm the strike now. He goes for a heave on the final delivery, lands safe of the fielder at mid on and gets him two runs.\n\nLyon to Nitish, punches to long on for a single. WICKET! The partnership is broken. Washington is caught at slip.\n\nWashington Sundar c Smith b Lyon 50(164)\n\nLyon. Nitish tries to paddle sweep but is beaten. Takes a single off the next ball. 95 now for him.\n\nWashington Sundar reaches his fifty in 146 balls. Terrific knock. Has looked solid. Nitish also enters 90s with a four towards backward square leg. A brilliant fightback by these two.\n\nLyon. Sundar takes a quick single. Just that quick single from the over.\n\nScott Boland into the attack. Spongy bounce on that nip-backer! Reddy somehow manages to keep the ball away from stumps. A maiden over.\n\nNathan Lyon is back. Sundar wanted to tap and run but was sent back by Nitish. Good call. Sundar punches towards cover and gets three. Lovely shot. Nitish pushes the ball towards square leg, Khawaja tries to dive and stop but falls bad on his right knee. He’s okay though. Six runs from that over.\n\nMarsh. Sundar pushes the ball towards midwicket and the batters run an easy double. Sundar leaving length balls and anything outside off. He ends the over with a quick single.\n\nStarc. Beats Nitish! Quick, seamed away from off stump. Nitish was lucky not to edge that. Maiden over.\n\nMarsh. Nitish goes for flashy drive, the ball goes behind point for a single. Risky. One more run added to the total this over.\n\nStarc from the other end. Nitish pushes the ball towards point and takes a single. Just one run from that over.\n\nNitish and Sundar are back in the middle. India 326/7, trails Australia by 148 runs.\n\nMitch Marsh to begin proceedings. Sundar lets the first two balls go. Sundar has come prepared to leave anything outside off.\n\nMatch to resume at 10:30 AM IST if there’s no more rain.\n\nCovers are coming off. Still a bit overcast, umpires are still having a look. Rain has completely stopped.\n\nLive pictures suggest the umpires are taking a look at the conditions. Although they are not in their full gears. The weather seems to have improved.\n\nThe delay continues. Still gloomy in Melbourne. Looks like we are in for more delay here.\n\nSo, it has started to drizzle and the players are walking off. Umpires might take an early tea here. Yes, bad light has forced an early tea.\n\nMitch Marsh into the attack. Down the leg, Nitish sweeps the ball towards fine leg, Starc dives but the ball falls just before him and goes for four. Off the next ball, Nitish goes towards square and gets another boundary.\n\nStarc is back. Sundar punches him towards cover for four off the first ball. Starc gets his line right in the next five balls.\n\nIndians keeping the scoreboard running with singles, quick singles, and doubles here and there. Australia waiting for a mistake now. Overpitched by Lyon, Nitish smacks the ball towards cover for four.\n\nLyon. Misfield by Cummins, Nitish takes a single to get India to 300-run mark. Three runs added to the total in this over.\n\nBoland. Ball is deviating off the pitch a bit. Good angles by Boland to keep the outside edge in play.\n\nLyon is back. Sundar defends, not much turn out there. Maiden.\n\nBoland. Keeper is standing up. Nitish tries to reverse ramp, misses and Australia appeals for LBW. Umpire says not out, not much discussions further. Keeper has gone back to its regular mark. NKR drives straight for four. Lovely shot to end the over.\n\nCummins. Sundar and Nitish continue to get easy singles on offer. Sundar plays with soft hands, the ball goes past gully and they add another two runs.\n\nScott Boland replaces Starc. Nitish drives the first delivery through covers, three runs. Beaten! Boland’s delivery leaves Washington’s drive. A single on the next as Head misfields at mid off. Two runs for Nitish through mid on, wants to play this through covers but gets an inside edge.\n\nCummins to Nitish. A single on the second delivery through point. Cummins tries a bouncer to Washington but the batter is able to duck under it with ease.\n\nStarc again. He squares up Washington, angles this towards the leg stump and the swing takes it away. Washington wants to flick but gets an edge towards point. Washington square drives the next past point for three. Nitish blocks this back of a length ball right under his eyes and takes a single. Washington flicks the last delivery through mid wicket, the ball does not run to the fence but the pair runs four nonetheless.\n\nCummins to Washington, punches through covers for three runs. That’s the 50 partnership between Washington and Nitish. Nitish punches the next delivery through point for one run. Washington glances the fifth to fine leg for one run .India has now avoided the follow on. An appeal for lbw on the final delivery but Cummins admits this is going a little down the leg.\n\nStarc to Nitish. FOUR! Wide and angling away, Nitish goes for it and picks the fence. MAIDEN FIFTY FOR NITISH! He drives the next through covers for two runs.\n\nCummins from the other end with this new ball. Nitish chips this down the ground, just gets enough bat on it to clear mid off, three runs. Gets the edge from Washington, goes to Marnus at third slip on one bounce.\n\nAustralia takes the second new ball. Mitchell Starc back into the attack. DROP! Starc sends a delivery down leg but somehow Washington manages to edge it towards the slips in trying to flick it. Steve Smith at second slip is not expecting it and goes with one hand and sees it pop out of his hand. A maiden over from Starc.\n\nHead to Nitish, drives the first delivery to long off for one run. A single for Washington through mid wicket. Nitish tries a reverse sweep but hits it towards the fielder at backward point.\n\nLyon to Washington. A maiden over. Lyon sticks to the off-stump line and Washington is able to get on his front foot and defend. Not much purchase for him though.\n\nHead to bowl now. Washington swipes through mid wicket to pick a single. Nitish rocks on his back foot, gets in line and punches to long on for another run. Washington cuts the last ball to get the third single of the over.\n\nLyon to continue. Washington looks to defend the fourth, gets it off the inside of the bat and runs one through the on side. Nitish opens the blade and guides the next through point for another single. Another single to end the over.\n\nCummins to Nitish. Beats the outside edge. In the channel, Nitish tries to defend it but the ball moves away from the angle. Back-to-back bouncers but Nitish sways away.\n\nLyon to Washington with two slips and a silly point. Cuts the first delivery and mix up between Konstas and Boland allows India a second run. A punch to long off to get India to 250 with a single. Nitish taps this through the off side and gets one. Edge for Washington and this time there is no second slip, two runs more.\n\nCummins to start the proceedings after Lunch. Washington on strike. A short leg for him and Cummins lands one short, Washington manages to fend at it and keep it away from that catcher. Washington places the fourth between mid wicket and mid on for two runs. Now punches through point for a single. Another bouncer from Cummins and it hits Nitish under his arm. He seems to be in considerable pain.\n\nWelcome to the second session on Day 3. How long can Nitish and Washington keep India batting in the first innings? The former is on 40 while Washington on 5. The second new ball is seven overs away.\n\nWhile India added 80 to its total in this session, it was Australia which helped itself and moved slightly closer to a win. The two wickets of Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja knocked further sail out of India’s wind. The visitor is still 230 behind and has its last recognised pair - Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar - batting.\n\nLyon to bowl the last over of the session. A single for Washington on the third delivery through mid wicket. Nitish defends the last three deliveries.\n\nThat will be it for the first session.\n\nTravis Head to bowl now. A single for Nitish with a drive to mid off. Washington punches to long off for the second single of the over. FOUR! Nitish steps out and takes this on the full, clears mid off.\n\nLyon to Nitish. Three runs, a little to wide from Lyon and Nitish cuts this. Lyon goes rounnd the wicket to Washington who pushes the third delivery through covers for a single. Another single for Nitish through covers.\n\nNitish drives the first delivery from Cummins through covers for one run. Edge! Cummins gets the fifth delivery to jump onto Washington, but the ball takes the glove and drops just short of the keeper.\n\nLyon for his eighth straight over. Washington picks a single to long on off the fifth delivery. Nitish with a soft clip through mid wicket to retain strike for the next over. Two runs from it.\n\nCummins to Nitish now. A bouncer on the body line, Nitish able to sway out of the way. Nitish tries to charge down the wicket, Cummins sends it down the leg. Another bouncer from round the wicket, Nitish drops his shoulders to this one too. Another maiden for Cummins.\n\nLyon to Nitish. SIX! Gets to the pitch using his feet and smokes this over long on. One run with a push through long on next.\n\nCummins back into the attack. Washington plays out all six deliveries. A maiden over.\n\nLyon again. Sharp turn from outside off, Nitish plays it in the air through mid wicket, one run. WICKET! This delivery is fired in, angles into Jadeja and goes straight. He is trapped in his crease as the ball thuds into his back foot. We have a DRS taken! This just about clips the bails and that is the end of Jadeja. India in trouble!\n\nRavindra Jadeja lbw Lyon 17(51)\n\nWashington Sundar in next. India still 54 away from avoiding a follow on. Washington off the mark with a punch through covers for a single.\n\nStarc to Jadeja, FOUR! On the pads, angling in and Jadeja clips it through mid wicket. The second delivery also angles into him and Jadeja glances it to deep square for one. Nitish clips through mid wicket, one run.\n\nLyon to Nitish, dances out on the first delivery but defends eventually. Comfortably defends the next five deliveries which are fuller and on the stumps. A second maiden for Lyon.\n\nStarc bowling to Nitish. A fly slip and two catchers in the deep at fine leg and backward square leg. Only one bouncer in the over to test him with a pull or a ramp shot. He takes a single off the final delivery.\n\nLyon to continue. Nitish comes down the track, looks to play it over covers, gets an edge past slip and runs two. Nitish punches the fifth to long on for one more run.\n\nStarc to Nitish. After three wide deliveries, Nitish gets one slightly straighter and full, drives through mid off for three runs. Jadeja with another risky single to mid on. Cummins makes a direct hit but Jadeja is safely home. A single through covers to finish the over.\n\nLyon to Jadeja. A square-ish silly point in place. Jadeja nudges the ball towards mid wicket for a single. Nitish punches off his back foot for another run through point.\n\nMitchell Starc into the attack. Coming around the wicket to the right hander and ball holds its line coming into the Nitish. Fuller length, Nitish drives, gets a thick outside edge past gully for four.\n\nLyon. NKR drives straight and for four! Good shot. Seven runs came in that over with three singles.\n\nBoland continues. Thick outside edge off Pant’s bat towards point and the batters run a double. Pant shuffles across and tries to ramp but misses and is hit on the body. OUT! Pant once again tries to ramp, gets a top edge straight to deep third. Poor dismissal. Pant falls for 26.\n\nNitish Kumar Reddy at the crease. Off the mark with a quick single.\n\nNathan Lyon into the attack. Pant pushes the ball towards midwicket and takes a double. Takes a single in the same region off the next ball. An LBW appeal for Jadeja. Umpire says not out. Australian discuss but don’t review. Quicker one took Jadeja by surprise.\n\nBoland kept bowling in the channel and Jadeja was happy to leave and defend. Boland strays down the leg off the last ball and Jadeja tucks it fine for four towards fine leg.\n\nAustralian bowlers are not letting the batters settle in on one angle. They have kept switching between over and around the wicket. Nothing from the pitch though. Pant and Jadeja have responded well so far.\n\nBoland. Short ball and Pant pulls it towards square leg for four. Good and well controlled shot. Pant pushes the ball towards leg and takes a quick single.\n\nCummins. Shorter lengths by the Australian bowlers. Just one runs added to the total.\n\nBoland. Short ball, Pant late cuts between slips for single. Lucky shot. Australia has put in two close-in slips and two regular slips. Jadeja is very keen on getting off the strike and is looking to take quick singles; has been denied by Pant.\n\nCummins. Pant comes down the track and launches the ball towards wide long-on for four! Australians appeal for an LBW off the next ball. Umpire says not out. Australia has reviewed straightaway. It was a short ball, looked to go close to the handle but replay suggests there was a lot of gap. Australia loses a review. Bouncer, Pant pulls and takes a single.\n\nScott Boland from the other end. Targets the stumps, Jadeja happy to defend. Boland switches between around and over the wicket and bowls a maiden over.\n\nPat Cummins will begin the day. Pant leaves the outside off delivery. Jaffa! Ball holds its line, making Pant come on frontfoot and defend before leaving him. Edged and four! Similar line as the previous ball, slightly fuller, Pant gets an outside edge that goes between slips..\n\nIndia will resume the day at the 164/5 with Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja at crease. India was 153/2 at one point before it lost three wickets in the last 30 minutes. Both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli got out in back-to-back overs while nightwatchman Akash Deep followed soon.\n\nIndia trails Australia by 310 runs.\n\nWelcome to the live coverage of the third day of the fourth Test between India and Australia at Melbourne. Stay tuned for the live updates.",

    "raw_text": "It may be difficult for a person with a sweet tooth to imagine losing weight since many feel that giving up their favorite foods is the first thing to do. However, this common myth has been put into question by fitness influencer Carla Visentin. In her latest social media post, Carla showed that she consumed some form of dessert each day in order to lose almost 40 kg.\n\nCarla has posted such a wonderful post on Instagram explaining the strategies with which she changed. Despite the common belief that losing weight means giving up all the tasty foods you love, Carla's journey proves otherwise. Her message encourages others that weight loss doesn't have to mean depriving yourself of your favorite treats.\n\nCarla, now offers diet and health tips based on her personal experience to help others on their weight loss journey.In one Instagram post she mentioned randon wightloss tips that helped her lose 40 kg.\n\n1: Exercise alone won't help you lose weight unless you follow a calorie-deficit diet. Carla advised choosing a physical activity that encourages movement and that you can stick to.\n\n2: Sometimes thirst is disguised as hunger, so drink water and wait a couple of minutes to determine if you're actually hungry.\n\n3. Eating the same item each day will make tracking your caloric intake easy. It will help you prepare meals more quickly and prevent you from becoming indecisive.\n\n4. She would take pre workout drink before working out and put herself in automatic mode to encourage herself to go to the gym. She would become so excited by this that she would inevitably go to the gym.\n\n5. Using smaller utensils will help slow you down while you are eating and stop you from inhaling the food in 2 seconds. Additionally, eating with a smaller plate tricks the mind into thinking that you are eating more.\n\n6. The fitness influencer suggested setting aside some calories every day to eat something you like. “I have some form of dessert every day because it stops me from going crazy and regulates my cravings,” she revealed. It doesn't matter what you eat; as long as you're eating in a calorie deficit, you will lose weight.\n\n7.The influencer advised chewing sugar-free gum whenever you're hungry or craving sweets.\n\n8. Little mind shifts go a long way when it comes to motivation. Carla confessed that the fact that she had transformed because she liked herself and this was her favourite motivating point.\n\nHer transformation story is a powerful reminder that with the right mindset and approach, achieving a healthy body while enjoying life's pleasures is possible.",

    "authors": ["NDTV Movies News Desk"],
    "raw_text": "New Delhi:\n\nFilm veteran Naseeruddin Shah slammed Hindi films celebrating \"hyper masculinity\" and \"debasing women\", released in recent time, at the Kerala Literature Festival. The actor had a conversation with actor Parvathy at the film festival.\n\nWhen Parvathy asked Naseeruddin Shah about the \"implosion of insecure hyper masculinity\" in mainstream films, he quickly replied that the success of such \"sickening\" films actually showcases the state of society we are living in.\n\nIn recent times, films like Animal, Pushpa 2 had major box office success though the films were slammed for their take on masculinity.\n\n\"I don't know if it's a reflection of our society or if it is a reflection of the fantasies of our society,\" Naseeruddin Shah added.\n\n\"I think the films which feed into the secret fantasies of men, who in their heart of hearts, look down on women, these are being fed and it's actually very scary to see how much approval such films get from the common viewer. It's very terrifying and it does explain the horrendous things that happen to women in a lot of places in our country, \" Naseeruddin Shah said at the film festival.\n\nNaseeruddin Shah also admitted at the event that he did a few films for money only. \"I have also done some movies which I did only for the money, that's the simple truth. I don't think that one needs to ashamed of working for money, I mean what do we all do? But those are jobs I regret. Fortunately, people don't remember the bad work you did.\n\n\"As an actor, they only remember the good things you did,\" he said.\n\nNaseeruddin Shah was last seen in Sonu Sood's Fateh.",

UPSC Essentials will provide some guiding points or ideas as a thought process that will help you to evaluate your answers.\n\nTHOUGHT PROCESS\n\nYou may enrich your answers by some of the following points\n\nQUESTION 1: Discuss the link between the quality of elementary education and higher education institutions in India. How does the foundation created during primary school affect leadership and general quality in higher education?\n\nIntroduction:\n\n— Education is essential for realising individual potential, creating an equitable and just society, and advancing national progress. Providing universal access to quality education is critical to India’s continuous rise and leadership on the global arena in areas such as economic growth, social fairness and equality, scientific advancement, national integration, and cultural preservation.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n— The global education development goal, expressed in Goal 4 (SDG4) of the 2030 goal for Sustainable Development, accepted by India in 2015, is to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030.\n\nBody:\n\n— It has been observed in intellectual circles at prestigious universities, well-established schools, and systems that manage a huge number of institutions. The trust gap suffered by government schools is a prime example, and practically every Indian family agrees. The Indian education system witnessed a significant shift in attitudes from “why educate” to the demand for “good education in a good school not only for boys but also for girls”.\n\n— The post-independence increase of school education, and thus higher education, was unavoidable. However, there was a significant shortage of educated and competent people, as well as a constitutional mandate to provide free and compulsory education to all children until they reached the age of 14.\n\n— The quality of higher education institutions, including their leadership, is directly related to the quality of basic education.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n— We have inherited the legacy of great academics and researchers, who may motivate young people to pursue professional goals that benefit society as a whole.\n\n— There are occasions where a single leader has transformed an institution. Every great university is always remembered, coupled with one brilliant individual who propelled it to new heights. For example, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Syed Ahmed Khan, Rabindranath Tagore, and Zakir Husain were instrumental in the founding of BHU, AMU, Vishwa Bharati, and Jamia Malia Islamia.\n\n— A primary school should instill a culture of punctuality, respect for hard work, and complete attention to the worth of every minute, all while contributing to nation building.\n\nConclusion:\n\n— This National Education Policy 2020 is the first education policy of the twenty-first century, and it seeks to address our country’s numerous expanding developmental imperatives.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n— The Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE), chaired by the Union Education Minister, is made up of a diverse group of state education ministers, academics, and important institutions from around the country. They might discuss and address topics such as education policy and the selection procedure for vice-chancellors, as well as how to develop leaders at all levels of educational institutions, including primary schools.\n\n(Source: How quality of higher education is tied to primary education by J S Rajput, http://www.education.gov.in)\n\nPoints to Ponder\n\nRead more about the National Education Policy, 2020\n\nEnrollment in higher education\n\nConstitutional provisions related to education\n\nRelated Previous Year Questions\n\nDiscuss the main objectives of Population Education and point out the measures to achieve them in India in detail. (2021)\n\nHow have digital initiatives in India contributed to the functioning of the education system in the country? Elaborate your answer. (2019)\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nQUESTION 2: Examine the significance of the Kumbh Mela in India’s independence movement. What role did this religious group play in promoting nationalist movements and mobilising the populace against colonial rule?\n\nIntroduction:\n\n— On November 1, 1858, a great durbar was held in Allahabad in what is now known as Malaviya Park. Lord Canning, the Viceroy, read the Queen’s momentous proclamation, which ended the East India Company’s 250-year reign and transferred the government directly to the Crown.\n\n— The site of the proclamation was also significant; Allahabad would quickly become a major focus of political and religious activities, notably the Maha Kumbh, which is held every 12 years.\n\n— Allahabad became the centre of government and public life. A High Court was founded in 1867, Muir Central College in 1877, and Allahabad University in 1887. The city would soon be home to a burgeoning student population, as well as existing powerful Indian families.\n\nBody:\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n— One of the first changes to affect the Kumbh Mela was the emergence of an influential Hindu ‘lobby’ that wanted to create a space within the colonial state where Indian political sovereignty was respected.\n\n— One component of this development was the types of things available for purchase at the fair. In the early nineteenth century, the mela drew luxury goods from as far as Persia. Fanny Parks, a British travel writer, reported the presence of pearls, semi-precious stones, bows and arrows, sable and costumes, and Persian and Arabic books in the 1830s mela. In contrast, from the late nineteenth century onwards, devotional goods such as trinkets, pamphlets, religious paraphernalia, idols of Hindu gods and goddesses, puja materials, and the like began to appear.\n\n— The Kumbh Melas provided a platform for the spread of nationalist ideologies beginning in the early twentieth century. “As nationalism developed, the hub of politics emanating from Allahabad’s notables, such as Motilal Nehru, Madan Mohan Malaviya and Purushottam Das Tandon, gave it a national reputation, giving the pilgrimage an extra dimension,” according to Maclean.\n\n— From the early twentieth century onwards, pilgrimage manuals began to recommend that pilgrims visit Allahabad’s secular attractions, such as Minto Park (later known as Malaviya Park) and Anand Bhavan, the house of Motilal Nehru.\n\n— In his writings, Jawaharlal Nehru recounted pilgrims who, after bathing at the Sangam, would frequently visit the Bharadwaj Ashram, which was across from his residence.\n\n— During the 1907 mela, for example, Hindu ascetics were reported to preach swadeshi and nationalism. According to Maclean, the local press at the time endorsed this development as a task appropriate for sadhus as national exemplars.\n\n— By the 1930s, Congress was actively using the mela to disseminate the message of civil disobedience. According to Gould’s book, both the Kumbh and Magh Melas in the early weeks of 1930, sanyasis played a key role in turning the festivities into political rallies.\n\n— During the 1930 mela, for example, the British government disseminated information about the Sarda Marriage Act (1929), which prohibited the marriage of girls under the age of 14 and boys under 16.\n\nConclusion:\n\n— Since the late nineteenth century, the Allahabad Kumbh Mela has served as a venue for showcasing nationalist emotions through religious events. “Part of this was due to the British government’s stance of not intervening in religious matters. So religion became a stage for nationalist activity,” explains Lochtefeld. For example, the Ganesh Chaturthi became a nationalist event in the 1890s.\n\n(Source: How Kumbh Mela became a platform for nationalism during Independence movement by Adrija Roychowdhury)\n\nPoints to Ponder\n\nRead about Nationalist movement\n\nHow did Ganesh Chaturthi become a nationalist event in the 1890s?\n\nRelated Previous Year Questions\n\nWhat were the events that led to the Quit India Movement? Point out its results. (2024)\n\nSince the decade of the 1920s, the national movement acquired various ideological strands and thereby expanded its social base. Discuss.

I do really think before Hitler got on meth, he was a guy to go fishing with,\" the American fighter said.\n\n\"He fought for his country. He wanted to purify it by kicking the greedy Jews out that were destroying his country and turning them all into gays,\" he added.\n\n\"They were gaying out the kids. They were queering out the women. They were queering out the dudes. Do you know where the first tranny surgery ever was? Happened to be in Germany before Hitler took over.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League's chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt slammed Mitchell for the range of antisemitic, homophobic and transphobic comments.\n\n\"I'm aghast at this podcast interview. There are simply no words,\" Mr Greenblatt told BBC.\n\n\"In the span of just a few minutes Mitchell manages to express antisemitic, homophobic, and transphobic sentiments. We hope the UFC will take immediate action to make clear that these ideas are noxious and have no place in the sport.\"\n\nAlso Read | Sam Altman-Backed Startup Raises $425 Million To Build World's 1st Nuclear Fusion Power Plant\n\nDana White reacts\n\nReacting to Mitchell's comments, UFC boss Dana White released a statement, calling Hitler the \"most evil human being\".\n\n\"Hitler is one of the most disgusting and evil human beings to ever walk the face of the Earth and anyone that even tries to take an opposition position is a moron,\" said Mr White.\n\n\"That's the problem with the internet and social media. You provide a platform to a lot of dumb and ignorant people.\"\n\nDespite the gravity of Mitchell's statements, Mr White said UFC would not take any disciplinary action against the fighter owing to freedom of expression.\n\n“It's free speech. That's the beautiful thing about this business, for all of you who hate Bryce Mitchell, you get to see him hopefully get his ass whooped on global television.”\n\nHitler led Germany into World War II as leader of the Nazi party and ordered the Holocaust genocide, where six million Jews were murdered.",

    "title": "\"You Will Find Akash Deep Not Playing Another Test\": R Ashwin's Blunt Take On Team India",
    "authors": ["NDTV Sports Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin feels pacer Akash Deep will find it hard to get back into the Test side in the near future. Ashwin, who retired last month during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, explained how bowlers don't get enough backing in India, whereas in Australia things are different. Speaking at AWS AI Conclave 2025 in Bengaluru, Ashwin explained why India is far behind Australia as a cricketing powerhouse. Ashwin rued over the fact that bowlers tend to get sidelined after a few bad outings, unlike the batters; who don't get the same treatment.\n\n\"It is an unfair world. The batters get cocooned, but the bowlers don't. You will find Akash Deep not playing another Test match because he didn't get enough wickets in Australia. But you will never find another batter who hasn't made enough runs not playing another game for India. That's exactly why Australia is a dominant force in world cricket and Indians aren't,\" said Ashwin.\n\nOn the contrary, Ashwin explained why Australia are far ahead of India in terms of recognising their strengths, which is the main reason why they always manage to perform at big events.\n\n\"Even though we have everything, I still think Australia are a dominant force because they know where their roots are and they know bowlers are their main guys who will win Test matches and tournaments. The day we get there, bowlers will start consuming data way better than they do,\" he added.\n\nAshwin pulled down the curtains on his illustrious Test career after taking 537 wickets in 106 Test matches. He also registered 156 ODI wickets in 116 matches and 72 wickets in 65 T20I appearances.\n\nTalking about his final Test appearance, Ashwin played the day-night Test in Adelaide and picked up one wicket.",

    "title": "NSE Nifty 50 Index Today - S&P CNX Nifty",
    "raw_text": "About Nifty\n\nThe Nifty is the flagship benchmark of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), which is a well-diversified index, comprising top 50 companies in terms of free-float market capitalisation that are traded on the bourse. It is supposed to reflect the health of the listed universe of Indian companies, and hence the broader economy, in all market conditions.\n\nOfficially called the Nifty50, the index is computed using the free float market capitalisation method, which is essentially the count of shares in active circulation in the market at any given point of time.\n\nThe Nifty, just like BSE benchmark Sensex, is today used for benchmarking portfolios and returns of mutual fund schemes and launching index funds.\n\nThe Nifty index was launched on April 22, 1996, with a base value of 1,000 counted from November 3, 1995. Live Nifty quotes are available on NSEIndia.com, ETMarkets.com and numerous other web platforms and TV channels at any point of time.\n\nThe Nifty brand and indices are managed by the Mumbai-based India Index Services and Products Limited, IISL in short, which itself is a subsidiary of NSE. IISL has a three-tier governance structure comprising the board of directors, the index policy committee and the index maintenance sub-committee. IISL managed some 67 indices under the Nifty brand as of September 30, 2016.\n\nIISL rebalances the Nifty index semi-annually. The cut-off dates for the semi-annual review of the index are January 31 and July 31 each year. Average data for the six months ending the cut-off date is considered. The exchange notifies any change in the index four weeks before such changes take effect.\n\nThere are defined eligibility criteria for selection of Nifty constituent stocks. The liquidity of a stock is measured by the market impact cost, which is essentially the cost involved in transacting a stock. For a stock to qualify for inclusion in the Nifty50, it must have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less for six months and for 90 per cent of observation cases.\n\nBesides, the company must have a listing history of at least six months. However, a newly-listed company, which has just got listed through the IPO route, may become eligible for inclusion in the index, if it fulfils the normal eligibility criteria for a three- month period instead of six months.\n\nOnly those stocks which are eligible for trade in the F&O segment of NSE are considered for inclusion as Nifty constituents.\n\nAs of September 20, 2017, the Nifty had 35.73 per cent components from the financial services sector, 14 per cent from the energy sector, 11.46 per cent from the information technology sector, 10.64 per cent from the automobile sector and 10.13 per cent from the consumer goods sector. Six of the nine BFSI companies in the Nifty50 were private banks.\n\nThe Nifty index also has several variants such as Nifty Junior, Nifty50 USD, Nifty50 Total Returns index and NIFTY50 Dividend Points Index.",

    "authors": ["Nikhil Pandey"],
    "raw_text": "NASA scientists have found an asteroid named 2024 YR4, which might collide with Earth in 2032, posing a 1-in-83 chance of impact. The asteroid, measuring around 130 to 300 feet across, is too small to threaten the extinction of humankind, but experts warn that it could cause massive destruction if it hits a major city. The impact would unleash an energy equivalent to 8 megatons of TNT-more than 500 times the power of the atomic bomb that obliterated Hiroshima, Japan.\n\nAccording to NASA, the scientific analysis of a near-Earth asteroid, designated 2024 YR4, indicates it has a more than 1% chance of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032-which also means there is about a 99% chance this asteroid will not impact. Such initial analysis will change over time as more observations are gathered. Currently, no other known large asteroids have an impact probability above 1%.\n\nAsteroid 2024 YR4 was first reported on December 27, 2024, to the Minor Planet Centre-the international clearinghouse for small-body positional measurements-by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System station in Chile. The asteroid, which is estimated to be about 130 to 300 feet wide, caught astronomers' attention when it rose on the NASA automated Sentry risk list on December 31, 2024. The Sentry list includes any known near-Earth asteroids that have a non-zero probability of impacting Earth in the future.\n\nThere have been several objects in the past that have risen on the risk list and eventually dropped off as more data have come in. New observations may result in reassignment of this asteroid to 0 as more data come in.",

    "authors": ["NDTV Sports Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Virat Kohli's cheap dismissal in the first innings of the Ranji Trophy match between Delhi and Railways triggered the iconic cricketer's fans, who decided to went their anger on social media. Kohli, making his return for Delhi in the Ranji Trophy after 13 years, was undone by a brilliant delivery from Railways pacer Himanshu Sangwan. As a result, Virat only lasted for 15 balls, scoring 6 runs in the process. Disappointed by Kohli's early dismissal, his fans tried to target Himanshu Sangwan on social media, but vented their anger on the wrong person.\n\nAnother Instagram user, by the name of Himanshu Sangwan, whose profile was public, suddenly experienced immense traffic on his account, while the comments section of his profile also got filled with hateful words from angry fans.\n\nThe person even shared a video and put status, saying he isn't the same Himanshu Sangwan who dismissed Kohli at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday.\n\nFor the 5000-odd crowd that assembled here to watch Kohli (6 off 15 balls), it was fun while it lasted but when he had his off-stump uprooted by Railways pacer Himanshu Sangwan in the 28th over of Delhi's first innings, a majority of them took no time to exit the Arun Jaitley Stadium.\n\nKohli came out to bat to a loud reception following the leg before dismissal of Yash Dhull at about 10.30am local time, which was an hour into day's play.\n\nIt was left-arm pacer Rahul Sharma who first got to bowl at the cricketing icon and with a spring in his stride, he bowled a yorker down the leg-side only to realise that he had overstepped.\n\nConsidering the batter in front, Rahul went for that little extra in his following ball and it turned out to be another no ball.\n\nIn the next over bowled by medium pacer Kunal Yadav, Kohli tried to assert himself and played and missed twice to balls pitched on his vulnerable zone -- wide outside the off-stump.\n\nAfter collecting two singles, Kohli decided to dominate the opposition -- right-arm pacer Sangwan in this particular over.\n\nStanding way outside the crease, Kohli disdainfully dispatched Sangwan towards the straight boundary.\n\nIt was still the first session and the ball was doing a bit but in his attempt to dominate Sangwan, the very next ball, Kohli went for an expansive drive off a good length delivery but missed it completely to see his off-stump shattered.\n\nThe ball seamed back in contributing to Kohli's downfall.\n\nHe had a quick look at the surface before trudging back to the pavilion and with him his sea of fans headed towards the exit door.\n\nWith PTI Inputs\n\nTopics mentioned in this article",

Even though my heart is full, I am saddened by the events of last night, and my prayers are with the families who lost loved ones. Har Har Gange! Har Har Mahadev!!\"\n\nOn the same day, veteran actor-turned-politician Hema Malini also took a dip at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya.\n\n\"It is my good fortune that I got the opportunity to take a 'snan' on this auspicious day,\" the BJP MP said.\n\nApart from Hema Malini, several other celebrities, including Sunil Grover, Kabir Khan, Guru Randhawa, Avinash Tiwary, Mamta Kulkarni, and Anupam Kher, have also participated in the grand religious gathering.",

    "title": "Readers’ comments: Important report on increase in communal riots has a data flaw",
    "authors": ["Scroll"],
    "raw_text": "The 84% rise in communal riots in 2024 in India, compared to 2023, is a very significant finding (“India saw 84% rise in communal riots in 2024: Report”). I may have spotted an important methodological issue, though. The report by the Centre for Study of Society and Secularism, which (quite rightly) uses newspapers as the source of data, does not include “communal riots that are either not reported or are reported in other editions of these newspapers”.\n\nIt is, indeed, true that newspapers do not always report riots that did not lead to fatalities. For a scholar, this is “missing data” – a common nuisance that can adversely affect their findings. Given that quite a few riots likely went unreported in both 2023 and 2024, or either year, a comparison of riot occurrences is unlikely to be fruitful or accurate. For example, if 2023 had as many riots (many unreported) as in 2024, it tells us a very different story – that nothing changed between the two years.\n\nA better method would involve counting fatalities rather than the number of riots. Newspapers will always report riots with fatalities, even if the death toll is only one. This better-quality data would reduce the bias arising from missing data on riots. Further, fatalities have greater political and social ramifications than property damage. Unfortunately, the report provides us the number of fatalities for only 2024, not 2023.\n\nThis methodological problem, of course, does not take away from the implications of the report. Small-scale rioting has always been a successful way of keeping the fires of hostility burning – until the time is perfect for pogrom-like anti-minority violence to be organised, when required. It is usually required when a political party in power, whose victory does not depend on minority votes, finds its power waning. Extreme violence is a tempting strategy to consolidate the majority vote. – Raheel Dhattiwala\n\nKumbh photos\n\nShame on Scroll for running a business on public pain (“Despair and horror: 10 photos that tell the story of the stampede at the Maha Kumbh Mela”). You should share good things instead of photographs of scared and crying people. – Jiggi\n\nSend Christian clergy to convert Muslims\n\nChristians can live peacefully in India if they stop proselytising (“In Chhattisgarh, a Christian man’s body seeks a grave as fraternity is given a burial”). But they are not ready to do that. What is an army of thousands of pastors, nuns and other clergy doing in Hindu-majority states? Like any other country or society, Indians also have the right to push back against forces that disparage local religion and culture and promote an alien religion.\n\nWithdraw the army of pastors and nuns and deploy them in Kashmir, Kerala’s Malappuram, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh to proselytise and convert Muslims. – Muraleedharan Nair\n\n***\n\nAs usual, this report is not only one-sided but deliberately provocative “(Why a Christian pastor was denied a burial in his own village by India’s Supreme Court”). Let me inform your readers that it is a common and well-established practice that Christians bury their dead in the cemetery of their church and that they are barred from the graveyards of others. This fact should have been highlighted. Matters of burial and last rites should not be twisted.\n\nBut it seems the family of the dead thought they can bully the others and that the judiciary and media and news portals like Scroll will always come to their rescue and force others to give in to their demands. Last but not the least, who is paying for these adventures? This should have been investigated by the reporter.\n\nShame on Scroll for unnecessarily creating controversy. – Ajay Kumar Jha\n\n***\n\nOrthodoxy is always blind. Its animosity pounces not only on the living but also the dead. Religious fanatics now have their heyday in our country. Secularism and democracy have been withering over the past few years. – Saikat Rudra\n\n***\n\nThe “divide and rule policy” of the Bharatiya Janata Party continues. The regime is anti-Christian yet openly seeking “alms: from Christian countries and are even exporting their “Hindu” population to these very countries. – Noel Freeman\n\n***",

    "title": "‘Helicopter tourists’ to Everest Base Camp skip Himalayan trek, leave sherpas grounded",
    "authors": ["Shashwat Pant"],
    "raw_text": "When Pasang Nuru Sherpa recalls his childhood in the quiet village of Pangboche, in the foothills of Sagarmatha, the Nepali name for Everest, his memories take him back to the gentle hum of daily life: the swishing of prayer flags, the calls of mountain birds, and the soft clink of yak bells as the animals meander along the narrow trails.\n\nBack then, any disruption to this silence was rare, signaling either an emergency medical evacuation or the arrival of a high-profile visitor. Both were reasons for a helicopter to approach the homes of the Sherpa people, renowned for their ability to thrive on the world’s tallest mountains.\n\nToday, however, the choppers have become ubiquitous. Their duty now extends to serving “helicopter tourists”, the name given to affluent tourists who want an instant ride up nearly all the way to Base Camp and are willing to pay a premium for it. “The sound of helicopters never stops,” Pasang says. “They start flying at 6 am and don’t stop until sunset. It disrupts our lives.”\n\nIt’s more than just the noise; the air traffic has taken an economic and social toll on Pasang and his community, while also endangering the fragile ecosystems of their homeland already under stress due to rising temperatures. Residents say much of the profits from helicopter tourism end up with the operators, often based in Kathmandu or abroad, leaving local Sherpas to face the consequences and costs.\n\nReaching the Base Camp of the highest peak on Earth typically requires a minimum 14-day trek, often led by guides and filled with physical and spiritual preparation. But now much of the hard work can be shortened to a matter of hours for those willing to pay between $1,500 and $2,000 for a helicopter trip. The chopper takes tourists straight from Kathmandu to Base Camp or locations such as the Hotel Everest View, located in Syangboche (elevation 3,780 metres, or 12,402 feet), a small settlement above Namche Bazaar, the main gateway to Sagarmatha from the Nepali side. The mountain can also be scaled from the Chinese side, in Tibet, where it’s known as Qomolangma.\n\nCompanies also offer chartered flights starting from $5,000 that go even higher than Base Camp, to Kala Patthar, the viewpoint to see Sagarmatha from up close.\n\nThis facility for tourists to get close to the scenic mountain and savour its views while bypassing the grueling trek up to Base Camp represents a paradigm shift in the country’s tourism industry, helicopter operators say. Pratap Jung Pandey, first vice president of the Airline Operators Association of Nepal, says affluent tourists with limited time couldn’t get the “Everest experience” in the past, but now they can, thanks to the helicopter service.\n\nPandey also says the operations are in compliance with government regulations, including those set by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal and Sagarmatha National Park.\n\nThat hasn’t quelled protests by local communities, which have prompted the national park authorities to suspend helicopter flights in the region. Park authorities along with the local municipal government have also proposed changes to existing rules to ban non-emergency flights in the region.\n\nSherpas feel the pinch\n\nWith its harsh climate and rugged terrain, the Sagarmatha region has always been a challenging home for the Sherpas who traditionally relied on rearing livestock and trade with Tibet for their livelihoods. But with the arrival of adventure tourism and trekking, communities spread across different settlements in the Khumbu Valley region at the foot of Sagarmatha – including Tengboche (3,860 m/12,664 ft), Pangboche (3,985 m/13,074 ft) and Namche (3,440 m/11,286 ft) – saw their livelihoods change as thousands of people from all over the world started to pour in.\n\nThe helicopters are the latest arrivals, but they bypass iconic trekking routes in the Khumbu Valley, including Namche Bazaar, the gateway to Sagarmatha; Tengboche, home to one of the largest monasteries in the region; and Gorak Shep, the last stop before Base Camp (5,364 m/17,598 ft). These were places once abuzz with trekkers engaging deeply with the local culture.\n\nIn 2024, there were more than 5,600 helicopter flights recorded in the region, according to Sagarmatha National Park information officer Bibek Baiju, with some days during the peak trekking season (April-May and October-November) recording nearly 100 flights daily between 6 am and 5 pm.\n\nPorters carrying gear and supplies for trekkers say they feel the pinch the most as their earnings have gone down. “We have observed that the longer the trekkers stay with us, the more tips we get,” says Tenzing Bhote, a porter from Lukla, home to the region’s one and only airport and the starting point for the trek to Base Camp. “Now, with trips being shortened to seven days, our income is much lower,” he told Mongabay by phone.\n\nAccording to the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, 57,690 people visited Sagarmatha National Park in the 2022/2023 period. That was more than double the 26,492 visitors in the previous period. With each helicopter carrying an average of two tourists, that translates to an estimated 11,000 people (two out of every 10 trekkers) taking a chopper. Figures from the airline operators’ association also indicate that around 20% of trekkers use helicopters to either fly into or out of Sagarmatha National Park.\n\nAlso left out of this aviation boom are local Sherpa women, who play a critical role in managing the mountain’s lodges and gift shops.\n\n“We prepare for months, stocking food and supplies, but when tourists fly out quickly, much of it goes to waste,” says Pasang Sherpa, president of the Khumbu Women’s Committee. “We need to understand tourists spend more on their way back, and when they don’t trek back, our income is hit hard.”\n\nWith fewer tourists spending extended time in the region, the local economy is experiencing a ripple effect that impacts families, small businesses and cultural preservation efforts, says Sonam Sherpa, a youth activist advocating against helicopter tourism.\n\nBeyond financial losses, the personal bonds that often formed between trekkers and the Sherpas – sometimes leading to long-term support like sponsoring of their children’s education – has also weakened, residents tell Mongabay.\n\nThere was a time when trekkers stayed for weeks, forming deep connections with the local culture that left long-lasting impacts on both the hosts and the guests, says Mingma Sherpa, a lodge owner at Namche Bazaar.\n\n“They used to come for the journey,” he says. “Now, when coming down from the mountain, many prefer to fly out from Gorak Shep,” which is closer to Base Camp than Namche.\n\nPasang Nuru Sherpa from Pangboche says the fast-paced nature of helicopter tourism leaves little room for cultural exchange, further distancing visitors from the unique traditions of the Khumbu region. He says the region’s Sherpa culture, deeply rooted in Buddhist traditions and a reverence for the mountains, is becoming increasingly commercialised as tourism grows.\n\n“Ceremonies such as the puja, a prayer ritual performed to bless climbers before expeditions, have become mere spectacles for tourists rather than meaningful spiritual practices,” he says.\n\nSonam Dorjee shares a similar sentiment: “The special connection we had with visitors is disappearing,” he says.\n\nThe environmental consequences\n\nHelicopter tourism is also potentially disrupting the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas, an area already vulnerable to climate change, says Sudeep Thakuri, a climate scientist.\n\n“While there is no research on the ecological damage caused by helicopters in the region, the number of helicopters flying in the region obviously has an impact as they emit a lot of CO2 and disturb the wildlife in the region,” he says.\n\nResidents also say the noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights is driving wildlife, including snow leopards (Panthera uncia), Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) and musk deer (Moschus leucogaster), away from their natural habitats.\n\n“The locals’ concerns are valid, as the Khumbu Valley is very narrow, which amplifies the noise. This does have an impact on both the wildlife in the area and the livestock,” Thakuri says.\n\nWhile studies on this specific issue in Nepal are limited, researchers say they believe helicopter tourism could already be taking a toll on the iconic yet vulnerable snow leopards. Researcher Bikram Shrestha, who has studied the big cat in the region, says that as snow leopards are nocturnal animals, they might not be directly affected by daytime chopper flights. But he says he’s seen Himalayan tahr, a large goat-like animal that’s the prime prey for snow leopards, run away due to helicopter noise.\n\n“This could have an impact on their reproductive success and in turn the availability of food for snow leopards, the apex predators of the mountains,” Shrestha tells Mongabay.\n\nStudies conducted in high-altitude ecosystems, such as those in Alaska and the Alps, have found that noise pollution disrupts animal behaviors such as feeding, mating and migration. A study in the Alps showed that frequent helicopter noise caused a significant reduction in the grazing behavior of mountain goats, leading to decreased food intake and an increase in stress.\n\nIn Alaska, a study carried out for the US Army showed that when helicopters flew 100 meters (330 feet) above the ground, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) would flee up to 64 km (34 miles) away and spend significant time away.\n\nBack in Nepal, even domestic yaks (Bos grunniens) may be affected. Traditional herders tell Mongabay they’ve noticed increased agitation among their animals. Yaks are vital for local communities here, where they’re used for transporting goods and providing milk and manure – essential services for farming in this high-altitude region.\n\nThis aligns with findings from a 1991 study that indicates that helicopter noise and other disturbances can cause heightened agitation and behavioral changes in both livestock and wildlife. The study further suggested that aircraft-related disturbances may decrease food intake in animals.\n\n“Our yaks are vital – not just for milk but for manure, which is essential for fuel and farming,” Pasang Nuru says. “If yak herding is affected, it’s not just an economic loss; it’s also the loss of a cultural tradition.”\n\nIn addition to the strain on wild animals, helicopter noise could have severe repercussions for the fragile mountains and glaciers, already under stress from rising global temperatures, says Thakuri, the climate scientist. Frequent movement of aircraft could potentially increase the risk of avalanches and landslides, especially in areas where helicopters fly close to the ground, he says. Locals still remember the recent destruction of the village of Thame by glacial floods, and say they worry that increased helicopter activity could aggravate such disasters.\n\n“Who’s to say it won’t happen again with helicopters flying so close to the mountains?” asks Sonam Dorjee Sherpa, the youth activist.\n\nEven before tourism took off as a major enterprise, local communities were already bearing the cost of living in Sagarmatha National Park since it was established in 1976. As a protected area and UNESCO World Heritage site, Sagarmatha is subject to various restrictions, such as limits on construction of houses, felling of trees, and laying of power lines, all aimed at conserving the natural ecosystems.\n\nWhile the local communities bear such immense costs of instant tourism, they don’t have a share in the profits, says Mingma Sherpa, the Namche lodge owner. “The money is leaving Khumbu,” he says. “The helicopter companies profit, but we are left with the consequences.”\n\nA report prepared by local residents with support from the municipality of Khumbu Pasang Lhamu showed that less than a fifth of the hourly fee of 145,000 rupees ($1,050) for an Airbus H125 helicopter operating in the area remains within the national economy –and that’s only if the pilot is Nepali. Economist Arjun Dhakal, who specialies in natural resources, says the number sounds plausible, given that a large chunk of the revenue goes toward repayment of loans taken out by companies to buy the aircraft, pay for insurance and cover operating costs, including fuel.\n\n“This shows that helicopter tourism is not beneficial for both the local as well as national economy,” he says.\n\nThe operators do pay a $21 fee to the national park for every flight, but that’s hardly enough for the damage they cause, say local community leaders, who argue that the ideals of ecotourism — sustainable travel that benefits both nature and communities — have been cast aside in the pursuit of quick profits.\n\nMingma Sherpa says many tourists opt for helicopter rides to save time, but this fast-paced tourism model undermines the region’s long-term sustainability vision for ecotourism practices that ensure a win-win for development as well as conservation.\n\n“Helicopters may bring in more tourists, but they don’t bring sustainable development,” he says.\n\nMitigating impacts\n\nRecognising the growing impact of helicopter tourism, local communities are taking a stand. Youth groups in the region have staged protests, blocking helipads and demanding stricter regulations.\n\nMunicipal officials from Khumbu Pasang Lhamu are also advocating for policies that limit flights, reroute them away from sensitive areas, and ensure that tourism profits are distributed more fairly among local communities.\n\n“We need balance,” says Pasang Nuru Sherpa. “The helicopters aren’t going away, but if we don’t manage their impact, we risk losing everything: our culture, our peace, and our way of life.”\n\nHelicopter operators say their services aren’t the primary cause of environmental or cultural disruption in the Sagarmatha region. Pandey from the airline operators’ association acknowledges the problems caused by the noise, saying, “We will try to address these concerns, but variable weather conditions sometimes force us to fly at low altitudes.”\n\nHe says helicopter transport plays a vital role in the region, supporting the transportation of food, construction materials and emergency medical rescues. “Without us, even basic logistics in such a harsh region would be challenging,” he says.\n\nPandey adds that some of the criteria imposed by local authorities in response to the protests over helicopter flights, such as rerouting flights away from sensitive areas, are difficult to meet under current operational needs. He says that if helicopter services are limited only to rescue operations, the government would need to take over the operations entirely, and pay proper compensation to the operators.\n\n“We have advance bookings made six months to a year prior to a flight. This protest by the locals has forced us to cancel flights,” says Pandey, who’s also the managing director of Kailash Helicopter Services Ltd., one of the 11 helicopter companies flying the route.\n\nWhile the operators agree that climate change is a significant issue, Pandey says helicopter emissions contribute minimally to environmental degradation. Instead, he calls for a balanced approach that allows for both tourism and sustainability, emphasising that “helicopters are a lifeline in this region, not just for tourists but also for locals.”\n\nBack at his village in Pangboche, Pasang Nuru says he longs for those quiet days when life was simpler for the Sherpas. He also acknowledges that the helicopters are a necessary lifeline to the region, but says they shouldn’t be used for fancy instant parties for the rich.\n\n“We’ve lost our peace, parts of our culture are at risk, and we have lost the connection we once shared with the mountains and the people who came to see them,” he says. “All we are saying is that we want to get back those days.”\n\nShashwat Pant is a Kathmandu-based journalist writing about culture, tourism and mountaineering.",

    "raw_text": "It is said that when Lucy’s great-grandfather Cheriyan took his life at the age of forty-five, the only thing left behind was massive debt.\n\nZacharia was fifteen years old then – a scrawny chap with an unpleasant smile. His older brothers, overwhelmed by newfound responsibilities, escaped to Bombay, abandoning their mother and younger sister to fend off local predators. When the thugs arrived, claiming they had lent money to Cheriyan and taunting that Zacharia’s mother and sister could repay the debt with their bodies, the teenager dropped off school early to find employment.\n\nHis first job was assisting a local fish merchant in Chambakkara Market. He unloaded the fish from the boats and displayed them in the open stand, bellowing with gusto: “Meene venno, Meen. Fresh fish. Best fish. Ayilla Matti, Chura. Meene venno Meene.” When someone made a purchase, he expertly gutted the fish, removed its entrails and chopped it into curry-sized portions, ultimately wrapping them in banyan leaves.\n\nDuring those years, he woke up before dawn and returned home only after midnight, labouring until he collapsed without ever complaining. Within a few years, on his eighteenth birthday, the boy who had once been deemed useless opened a seafood wholesale shop with the help of his employer.\n\nA small board was soon put up: Palathikal Seafood Co. Seven decades later, the boy had amassed a fortune greater than the former rulers of Cochin. In addition to owning hundreds of fishing vessels throughout the Arabian Sea, he also possessed a multitude of seafood restaurants and resorts. There was also the textile import business from Europe and the Middle East, a food processing company called Ilachi and a film studio in Madras. The list had no end. But out of all his gems, the one that stood out the most was the Daily Malayalam, a newspaper agency that became a staple for thirty-four million Malayalees since the 1960s. It was rumoured that in his prime Zacharia held considerable sway in Kerala politics and had a monopoly in publishing.\n\nBut nobody, not even his mother, was aware of how his circumstances transformed so dramatically – how an individual who had scarcely completed high school ascended to the position of CEO of an empire.\n\nSome who witnessed his rise tried to spread rumours that he was involved with narcotics – that Zacharia had connections with the mafia and helped them import contraband through Kochi port. Others believed he had delved into durmathravadam (witchcraft) and paid obeisance to a kuttichattan (devil), a very prevalent practice that survived generations in Kerala.\n\nBut those who were close to him believed the man possessed a sharp knack for trade. They held him in high esteem as a savvy entrepreneur who fearlessly fought for the rights of the common man. Despite the conflicting notion of who he was, everyone agreed that Zacharia had an extraordinary talent to foresee the future. It was like he had a fortune teller’s crystal ball and knew how to use it.\n\nAfter the birth of his three children from a late marriage, Zacharia slowly began to reside in the comforts of his home. He kept a firm grip on his companies and local politics but spent most of his time mentoring his younger ones to take over his empire.\n\nHis oldest son, George, was smart and cunning, ruthless in his endeavours even as a teenager. And for that, his father treated him differently and gave him responsibilities early in life. In business, Zacharia knew, it is only people like George who survive.\n\nHis only daughter, Elza, had her own ways of making sure she emerged victorious in every game she played. She knew how people worked and used it to her advantage. Determined and driven, she pursued her desires relentlessly.\n\nAnd though Zacharia tried to see all his children as equals, like all other parents he had a favourite – his youngest son, David, the kindest of them all.\n\nWhen both his elder siblings were sent abroad for studies, David was kept at a hand’s distance. It might be this sort of kind nature that led him to marry early and eventually produce the first heir to the family, Lucy. Ever since then, Lucy had been in Zacharia’s thoughts. His first granddaughter, his favourite, the one he truly cared about. Though everyone enjoyed David and his wife’s soothing company, fate had another plan for them. Their untimely death was a blow to the family. Zacharia was never the same after that.\n\nIn his old age, Zacharia often communicated with others in a cryptic tone. He mentioned many times that he could talk to the dead and could hear other people’s thoughts. Many, including his children, took it as a sign of the old man losing his mind, blaming it on the Alzheimer’s that nibbled on his brain cells.\n\nHours before his death, the old man revealed to his lawyer that his last will was not just a transfer of wealth but also a message from the dead to the ones who still roam in this world. And its reasons would only be revealed in time.\n\nExcerpted with permission from Lucy and the Djinn, Pranoy Mathew, Westland.",

    "authors": ["Nandini Ramnath"],
    "raw_text": "When Indira Gandhi governed India between the 1960s and the 1980s, she was rarely depicted directly in films. If the prime minster was seen, it was mostly as a photograph or portrait in a government office. Now, Indira Gandhi is everywhere.\n\nA revival of interest in period dramas has led to an Indira revival of sorts too. She is in films about military victories over Pakistan, biopics of regional leaders – even movies about cricket and an income tax raid. And of course, she is present in films about her father Jawaharlal Nehru’s reign as prime minister.\n\nMore recently, her lowest point as elected head of state – her suspension of the Constitution and civil liberties between 1975 and 1977 – has been committed to film. That is the focus of the January 17 release Emergency.\n\nKangana Ranaut directs the biopic and plays India’s first woman prime minister as a bundle of nerves who displays borderline psychosis during the Emergency period. Ranaut is helped along by Oscar winner David Malinowski’s prosthetics and makeup.\n\nBut even before Ranaut, Indira Gandhi has been portrayed in her Emergency phase by Supriya Vinod, Navni Parihar and Sarita Choudhury. At other stages of her life, she has been played by Avantika Akerkar and Charu Shankar.\n\nSupriya Vinod stars as Gandhi in Madhur Bhandarkar’s Indu Sarkar (the title is a play on Gandhi’s pet name). The 2017 film explores a conscientious poet’s rebellion against the Emergency. Neil Nitin Mukesh has a prominent role as Gandhi’s crooked son Sanjay Gandhi.\n\nVinod appears in a few dialogue-free scenes. Gandhi nods when assured that her Congress party will win the Lok Sabha election after the Emergency has been lifted and then drives off, ominously replacing her spectacles with sunglasses.\n\nVinod had previously played Gandhi in Yashwantrao Chavan (2014), Jabbar Patel’s biopic about the Congress politician from Maharashtra. Vinod also starred in Ratnakar Matkari’s Indira – The Play (2015), a psychological portrait of Gandhi between the Emergency and her assassination in 1984. Four years later, she was Indira Gandhi in the NT Rama Rao biopic NTR: Kathanayakudu.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Scroll, Vinod spoke about the challenges of playing Gandhi. “You have to make people remember her,” Vinod said. “The likeness has to be there.”\n\nVinod added: “She had a very famous walk, she used to walk very rapidly.”\n\nMost actors who have played Gandhi barely look like her. Acting skills, makeup, prosthetics, wigs and costumes combine to resurrect the leader.\n\nBecoming Indira Gandhi involves much more than wearing an impeccably draped sari or donning a close-cropped wig with its trademark white streaks, Avantika Akerkar told Scroll. Akerkar is arguably cinema’s favourite Indira Gandhi due to the actor’s talent for channelising her subject’s mannerisms and overall mien. She has played the leader in six productions till date.\n\nAkerkar first played Gandhi in the Bal Thackeray biopic Thackeray (2019), following it up with 83 (2021), Head Bush (2022), Mission Majnu (2023) and Padatik (2024). Akerkar also played Gandhi in the web series Mukhbir (2022).\n\nAkerkar was approached to act in Thackeray by the Shiv Sena (UBT) politician Sanjay Raut in 2018. “I could not mess up playing someone so iconic,” Akerkar said. “I couldn’t caricaturise her, nor could I pretend to be her. I had to get some of her mannerisms without copycatting her.”\n\nAkerkar’s research included Katherine Frank’s biography Indira and videos of Gandhi’s speeches. “I kind of got the cadence of her voice – she talked in a very high-pitched kind of voice,” Akerkar said. “I don’t do any makeup, so whatever you see in my roles as Mrs Gandhi is my natural face except for the slight eyebrows and the wig. There’s no prosthetic nose. That minute the wig goes on my head, something happens.”\n\nIn Abhijit Panse’s Thackeray, Akerkar’s Gandhi is so impressed by Thackeray (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) that she drops his Shiv Sena party from the list of proscribed political organisations during the Emergency.\n\nIn Kabir Khan’s 83, Gandhi cannily tries to quell communal riots at home by telecasting the Cricket World Cup that is underway in England – and in which India is performing brilliantly against expectations.\n\n“I find her fascinating and a bit of a tragic figure,” Akerkar said. “She was a very complex woman. She was also very smart and politically astute.”\n\nIf Mahesh Mathai’s biopic of the astronaut Rakesh Sharma had been made, Akerkar might have played Gandhi even earlier. Sharma began work on the film in 2015, but it has not been completed yet.\n\nMathai was keen on casting Akerkar for the scene in which Sharma tells Gandhi that from outer space, India looks “saare jahaan se accha” (the best place in the world). “Something about Avantika’s look, demeanor and bone structure reminded me of Mrs Gandhi,” Mathai told Scroll. “If I ever complete the project, I will still cast Avantika.”\n\nIndira Gandhi’s personal tryst with destiny began in her childhood. Born on November 19, 1917, Gandhi closely witnessed her father Jawaharlal Nehru’s participation in the freedom movement, his appointment as prime minister, and his leadership of the newly independent country. Films or shows about the early post-Independent years that have Nehru sometimes include Gandhi too.\n\nIn 1962: The War in the Hills, about the war between India and China, Geetika Vidya Ohlyan plays Gandhi. The role is played by Charu Shankar in Rocket Boys (2022-2023), about the involvement of Homi J Bhaba and Vikram Sarabhai in the development of India’s space and nuclear programmes.\n\nIn both shows, Gandhi is a leader in the making, picking up political strategy from the sidelines. The dominant image of Indira Gandhi in popular culture – the only woman in a room full of men, taking far-reaching decisions with firmness and precision – is from the 1970s.\n\nHindi cinema’s preoccupation with Pakistan, particularly the 1971 War, has led to a rash of productions based on actual or imagined missions. Films such as Bell Bottom (2021) and Bhuj: The Pride of India (2021) include a scene or two of Indira Gandhi consulting with the military top brass or putting her Pakistani equivalent in his place. The prime minister’s presence creates an image of muscular leadership, while also giving legitimacy to risky operations.\n\nBut the Gandhi in the Sam Manekshaw biopic Sam Bahadur (2023) is a different woman. Meghna Gulzar’s film imagines a flirty relationship between the dashing Chief of Army Chief Staff (Vicky Kaushal) and the Madam Prime Minister (Fatima Sana Shaikh).\n\nThe pucca Mankeshaw prevents Gandhi from attending a strategy meeting for which she does not have clearance. Later, after Gandhi has become prime minister, Mankeshaw becomes an unlikely confidante.\n\nI have problems, she sighs. Whenever you want, you have my shoulder to cry on, Manekshaw says. What if you are the problem, Gandhi retorts.\n\nIn movies set in other time periods, Gandhi has a talismanic presence.\n\nIn Raj Kumar Gupta’s Raid (2018), Gandhi, played by Flora Jacob, comes to the rescue of an honest Indian Revenue Service officer who is conducting a tax evasion operation against a corrupt politician in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIn AL Vijay’s J Jayalalithaa biopic Thalaivii (2021), starring Kangana Ranaut, Flora Jacob’s Gandhi openly admires the Tamil Nadu politician’s assertiveness in Parliament.\n\n“Indira ji was articulate, intelligent, polite, soft and yet very strong,” said Navni Parihar, who played Gandhi with quiet authority in Bhuj as well as the television shows Pradhanmantri (2013) and 7RCR (2014).\n\nFor Parihar, one of the biggest challenges was to sound like Gandhi.\n\n“It’s easier to do mythological characters since we don’t know what they look like, but Indira ji was prominent – her face, body language and voice are all seared in memory,” Parihar said. “The most difficult thing was to sound like her. She had a soft but firm voice, while my own voice is nasal and slightly husky.”\n\nParihar also focused on other aspects of Gandhi’s body language, such as her straight-backed walk, her style of sitting, the way she draped her sari border over her head. Parihar was praised for her accurate performance in Pradhanmantri by a friend of Sanjay Gandhi, she said.\n\nWhile there have been biopics about the freedom movement’s luminaries, the chronicling of milestones in post-Independent history is a little over two decades old. Filmmakers trying to make sense of momentous events in the recent past that resonate in the present find themselves running into the woman who was one of the most powerful prime ministers before Narendra Modi.\n\nPopular interest in fictionalised drama, whatever its veracity or merit, has been bolstered by advancements in makeup and prosthetics – even when the actors look nothing like their subjects.\n\nMakeup designer Prashant Doiphode, who transformed Lara Dutta into Indira Gandhi for Ranjit M Tewari’s Bell Bottom, observed, “If an actor doesn’t resemble the person, the make-up focuses on elements of the face, such as the skin tone, eyes, nose, eyebrows and jawline.”\n\nLara Dutta’s skin was aged to look like Gandhi, and she wore a prosthetic nose too, Daiphode said.\n\nContemporary films that revisit the 1970s are in stark contrast to productions made in that period. At the peak of her powers, Gandhi was either heavily fictionalised or an allegorical figure. Even a fleeting reference to her could be controversial or invite censorship.\n\nIn the biography SD Burman: The Prince Musician, Anirudha Bhattacharjee and Balaji Vital write about how a dancer reportedly called Indira in the Dev Anand starrer Gambler (1971) was renamed Julie after the film ran into trouble with the censor board.\n\nManoj Kumar got away with making a smuggler as an Indira Gandhi fan in Roti Kapda Aur Makaan in 1974. The film about rampant unemployment includes a commodities hoarder who never misses a speech by the prime minister.\n\nGulzar did not have it so easy. Similarities between Gandhi and the heroine of his Aandhi (1975) resulted in the film being pulled out of cinemas for a short period. Aandhi stars Suchitra Sen as Aarti Devi who, on her father’s insistence, walks out on her hotelier husband (Sanjeev Kumar) in order to pursue her political career.\n\nAandhi had already been in cinemas for nearly five months when the Emergency was announced. The film was re-released after a few cuts before the Emergency ended, Saba Mahmood Bashir writes in Gulzar’s Aandhi.\n\nGulzar told Bashir that he based Aarti Devi, especially her appearance, on Gandhi because she was the most prominent leader of her time: “… even today, there is nobody like her, so she was the best persona to keep in mind”.\n\nCritiques of the Emergency appeared in the 1970s itself. In Marathi filmmaker Dada Kondke’s Ram Ram Gangaram (1977) and IS Johar’s Nasbandi (1978), one of the Emergency’s most horrific legacies – the forced sterilisation of men as population control measure – is mined for comedy.\n\nThese films do not feature Indira Gandhi anywhere but lampoon her sycophants, especially local leaders and medical professional who are racing to meet daily sterilisation targets.\n\nIn Ram Ram Gangaram, a rural busybody trying to forcibly sterilise the hero played by Kondke is tricked into getting operated himself. In Nasbandi, a wheeler-dealer who is running a sterilisation campaign greets his guests not with a “Namaste” but “Jai Maruti” – a reference to the notorious Maruti Udyog car manufacturing company set up by Sanjay Gandhi.\n\nSimilarly, in the anti-Congress satire Kissa Kursi Ka. Indira Gandhi is nowhere and everywhere. Amrit Nahta’s film targets the dictatorial ways of Sanjay Gandhi and his posse. Nahta paid a heavy price for making Kissa Kursi Ka.\n\nThe film was completed in April 1975 – before the Emergency – but was never released. All the prints were destroyed on the orders of Vidya Charan Shukla, a Sanjay Gandhi crony and the Information and Broadcasting Minister at the time.\n\nIn 1978, after the Emergency had been lifted and the Janata Party came to power, Nahta remade the movie, retaining the title, script and most of the cast.\n\nThe film begins with a prayer to the “kursi god” (the god of power). Kissa Kursi Ka has barely disguised references to the Maruti Udyog project, Sanjay Gandhi’s good friend Rukhsana Sultan, Indira Gandhi’s all-powerful secretary RK Dhawan and the godman Dhirendra Brahmachari.\n\nSudhir Mishra’s Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi (2003) is a more thoughtful exploration of the political upheaval in the 1970s. Filmmaker Aditya Bhattacharya plays a politician closely modelled on Sanjay Gandhi, who rues that “rats are deserting the sinking ship” while standing before a photograph of Indira Gandhi.\n\nDeepa Mehta’s 2012 adaptation of Salman Rushdie’s post-modern classic Midnight’s Children stars British actor Sarita Choudhury as Gandhi. In his book, Rushdie refers to Gandhi only as “The Widow”, and says about her distinctive coiffure that “the white side of her hair was the visible documented part; the black the stuff about violence and torture”.\n\nWhile the book’s hero Saleem Sinai is born on August 15, 1947, his son Aadam comes into the world on June 25, 1975, the day the Emergency is announced.\n\nThe film’s Gandhi presides over the torture and sterilisation of prisoners. “The Emergency, everyone called it, but it was really a betrayal, her betrayal of her father’s dreams,” Rushdie says in a voiceover over close-ups of Gandhi chewing hard on her food.\n\nStrong leader or failed autocrat – screen depictions of Indira Gandhi have largely fallen into these two camps. But there have been bizarre indirect portrayals too, such as in Jumbish (1986).\n\nMade two years after Gandhi’s assassination, Salahuddin Parvez’s film stars Akbar Khan as Manas, a scientist who strives to create an ideal world by building two supercomputers that will mate and create a baby computer, thereby negating the need for human relationships.\n\nDaya Dongre plays Manas’s mother, who is the only thing standing between Manas and the Devil (Shafi Inamdar). Although known only as “Madam”, any resemblance between her and Gandhi is surely intentional.\n\nActors who played Gandhi in a positive light acknowledge her faults, especially her decision to impose the Emergency and her mishandling of the Khalistan separatist movement in Punjab in the 1980s.\n\n“The Emergency phase was definitely wrong,” actor Navni Parihar said. “But Mrs Gandhi was no shallow personality. She was an iron lady.”\n\nGandhi’s decision to allow the storming of the Golden Temple – the sacred Sikh shrine in Amritsar – to flush out her opponent Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale led to her assassination by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984. This final phase of Gandhi’s life, and portrayals of the Khalistan movement, remain contentious topics.\n\nIn 2014, Kaum De Heere, which valourises Gandhi’s assassins, was banned by the Union government despite being cleared by the censor board. The Punjabi movie was released only in 2019 after the Delhi High Court’s intervention.\n\nIn the film, Gandhi is played by an unidentified actor whose face is hidden by an umbrella. When confronted by her gun-toting bodyguard, only her voice can be heard asking, “Yeh kya kar rahe ho?” (What are you doing?)\n\nThe bodyguard and his accomplice pump bullets into Gandhi, causing her to moan and whirl around like a blood-stained marionette. The bodyguards smirk as Gandhi hits the ground.\n\n“Sometimes, people who start off with the right ideals get enmeshed in the machinery,” the actor Avantika Akerkar observed. “Mrs Gandhi became paranoid and sort of insular towards the end and made stupid mistakes. It’s a bit like Margaret Thatcher or Golda Meir – these strong women left their mark but what is remembered isn’t what they should be remembered for. I would like to hold on to the good things that Mrs Gandhi did and acknowledge that there were many bad things too.”\n\nAlso read:",

    "title": "How Kerala’s trade unions have failed women",
    "authors": ["Johanna Deeksha"],
    "raw_text": "The first protest that P Viji ever organised was for toilets.\n\nThe year was 2010 and Viji had been running a tailoring shop on SM Street, in the coastal city of Kozhikode, Kerala, for more than 15 years. She had learnt tailoring and set up the shop after failing to get a job as a salesperson in larger shops in the street. “At that time, I was told that they would only hire fair-skinned girls in sales positions, and because I was dark skinned I would be of no use in their shops,” Viji said, as we sat in her office in the shop on a sultry December day. “So I decided to learn tailoring.”\n\nOver the years, Viji formed friendships with other women working in the area. Though she was the proprietor of her establishment, most of the other women worked under other employers.\n\nIt pained Viji to hear of the challenges the women faced. “Saleswomen would not be allowed to sit down even once during their 10 or 12-hour shifts,” she said. “They were not even allowed toilet breaks. If they took an extra few minutes at the toilet, the boss would cut their salaries. Even during their menstruation days, they were not shown any leniency.”\n\nThis was despite the fact that there were not enough toilets in the area. “So sometimes, women would have to wait a while for their turn,” Viji said. “But even then, their employers would accuse them of taking too much time for their breaks and penalise them.”\n\nShe recounted that some women would avoid drinking water so that they would not have to use the toilets as often. “Can you imagine that?” she said. “Due to this, they would develop other health problems like urinary tract issues.”\n\nThese stories drove Viji to form Penkootu, a group for working women in the area, in the late 2000s. In 2010, the group organised its first formal protest, to demand that toilets be built for women on the street. A few other activists in the city also joined them in the protest, Viji recalled.\n\nTheir protest didn’t have any immediate effect.\n\nViji and some of her colleagues approached trade unions in the city, seeking support for their demand for toilets – they also raised other demands, such as for better wages and the rights of workers to take breaks and sit down. The unions did not support them.\n\n“They did not care for our problems,” Viji said. “They could not understand why these issues were important to us. They would not even allow us to speak to them properly.”\n\nShe added, “They simply didn’t see us as humans and as workers who were equal to them and deserved all the same rights as them.”\n\nBut despite this obstacle, the women’s protest was successful – six months later, the district collector inspected the area and ensured toilets were built.\n\nThis story is part of Common Ground, our in-depth and investigative reporting project. Sign up here to get a fresh story in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nThe failure of trade unions to support the women’s demands was indicative of a wider problem with left movements in Kerala.\n\nThe state is the undisputed bastion of left parties and organisations in the country. According to a 2018 report on trade unions in India by the ministry of labour and employment, Kerala has the highest number of registered unions in the country, with 13,099 such bodies – Karnataka is a distant second with only 4,711 registered unions. Kerala also has the largest number of members in state and central unions, at around 38 lakh, followed by Assam, which has around 23 lakh registered members of unions.\n\nKerala also has the largest number of women members of trade unions – more than 15 lakh women are members of state trade unions and more than 70,000 of central unions.\n\nBut Kerala’s trade unions have been criticised for not giving women a platform. A 2018 study analysed women’s participation in the Centre for Indian Trade Unions, one of India’s biggest unions. The study noted that there was a “serious dearth of unions and associations in the organised sector where women are more participative in general and at leadership positions in particular”.\n\nThe study also noted that a survey of over “200 collective agreements signed by nearly 1800 trade union leaders revealed that less than five out of 1800 were women trade union leaders who formally participated in collective bargaining and were signatories to the collective agreements”.\n\nFurther, the study observed that women face sexual harassment and assault in the unions but out of a fear of losing their jobs, usually refrained from discussing these problems.\n\n“Issues like maternity benefits, night shift work crèche facility and availability of washrooms for women are also matters of concern for working women,” the study noted.\n\nBut rather than view these hurdles as immutable, a few women, Viji among them, have sought to tackle them head-on by forming their own unions, through which they brought about significant improvements to the lives of working women.\n\nViji and her peers in Penkootu first decided to approach the government directly. Since the unions were “so heavily male-dominated, we realised it was no use trying to get them to care about our needs”, she said. “They didn’t view us in a humane way and it felt useless to continue to approach them.”\n\nBut to their dismay, government officials refused to acknowledge the women’s demands because they were not a registered union.\n\nViji and her team decided to form a women’s union and named it the Asanghaditha Mekhala Thozhilali Union, or the Unorganised Sector Workers Union. In 2014, members launched a protest, demanding the “right to sit” for women in textile shops. The protest garnered considerable attention from government officials and the public, inside and outside the state.\n\nThough the union was formed in 2014, Viji and her peers could only register it in 2016. “The other unions discouraged us saying there was no need for a women’s union to be formed because mainstream unions already existed,” she said. “There were several hurdles that we had to face before we were allowed to register properly as a union.”\n\nBut the protest by the women sparked similar protests by workers across the state. In 2018, the state government amended its Kerala Shops and Establishment Act, 1960, and introduced a new section that stated that “In every shop and establishment suitable arrangements for sitting shall be provided for all employees so as to avoid ‘on their toes’ situation throughout the duty time, so that they may take advantage of any opportunity to sit which may occur in the course of their work.”\n\nIn SM Street, the union also fought for women’s right to use the toilet – though public toilets had been built after the initial protests, proprietors at some establishments still barred employees from using their toilets.\n\nPriya M, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym for this story, has been a saleswoman at one such establishment, a textile shop, for more than 20 years. “The toilet inside was only for customers and management staff outside,” she said. “We had to use the toilet outside.”\n\nBut six years ago, Asanghaditha Mekhala Thozhilali Union intervened directly in the matter, forcing the shop to change its rules. “Today, we are also allowed to use the toilet inside, the same one used by customers and the management,” Priya said.\n\nDespite these successes, Viji noted that the act of organising women was a fraught one, and that many women workers, especially saleswomen, still hesitate to acknowledge their engagement with the women’s union. “If the employer hears them discussing the union or our work, they reprimand them,” she said.\n\nWomen workers have also been fighting to eliminate the gap in wages between men and women workers.\n\nAmong Indian states, Kerala has the largest wage gap between men and women engaged in casual labour. According to a report of the ministry of statistics and programme implementation, in June 2023, men workers in the state earned an average wage of Rs 903 per day, while women workers earned only Rs 494.\n\nThis corresponded with women’s accounts from the ground. “Women get paid around Rs 450 rupees and men are paid Rs 1,000,” Viji said. “A huge chunk of that money goes off in travel costs, so barely anything is left over for women.”\n\nDr Neethi P, a researcher from the Indian Institute for Human Settlements, pointed out that the longstanding pattern of unequal wages for men and women was a significant concern for female workers.\n\n“As we have seen in sectors like plantations, despite the existence of trade unions for many years, they have failed to ensure equal pay for men and women,” she said. In this context, she added, she often heard women workers ask questions such as “Why do we have trade unions if they cannot fight for your right to appropriate wages?”\n\nViji recounted that wages of women workers on SM Street were even lower a few years ago and that Penkootu had made several representations to the employers to increase them. “It was only around Rs 300 before,” she said.\n\nBut many women workers on SM Street continue to struggle for money, particularly those who work as sweepers and cleaners.\n\nSeventy-year-old Sreedevi Chandran has worked as a sweeper on the street for more than 36 years. She currently works across four shops, sweeping and mopping the interiors of each, as well as the road outside. She explained that she only gets paid small amounts at each shop, of around Rs 20 or Rs 30 a day. Another woman, also a sweeper, said that they were not even guaranteed this money. “We have to keep badgering them to even give us those few rupees,” she said. “We work and still have to beg them for the money.”\n\nThe question of low wages for women was also at the heart of large-scale protests by women tea estate workers in Munnar in 2015, perhaps the biggest public show yet of working women’s disillusionment with mainstream unions.\n\nAccording to a 2017 paper on the protests, the workers, mostly women, were being paid a wage of Rs 231 per day – when they were denied a wage hike and bonus in 2015, many of the workers were dismayed.\n\n“As per protocol, they brought their frustrations to their respective trade union leaders in order to begin the process up the communication chain,” the paper noted. “When the trade unions failed to act on the workers’ demands, a group of ten female plantation workers on the Periovari estate plotted an infiltration of one of the weekly, male-dominated trade union meetings. The women took the microphone and demanded an explanation. Word spread all over the plantation about this disruption.”\n\nThe women formed the Pempilai Orumai, or women’s rights group, and more than 5,000 women held a protest that stretched over 30 days. The women accused trade unions of being corrupt and hand-in-glove with the management, and demanded an increase in their wages. The women refused to allow other male workers, even from their own families or the trade unions, from participating in the protest. Each day, more women skipped work and joined the protest.\n\nThe response of local trade unions was telling of their culture of sexism. The paper noted that these unions were enraged by the women’s decision to protest and their “subsequent success” at organising such a large protest.\n\n“It quickly became apparent that the Pempilai Orumai posed a significant threat to the social and political influence traditionally vested in the trade unions,” the paper stated. It added that “Trade union leaders were quick to act on their rage”.\n\nAccording to the paper, as a way to undermine the women’s protest, other local trade unions also went on strike. “There was one distinctive catch: all those who pledged allegiance to the trade unions were guaranteed 500 rupees from the trade union for every day they participated in the strike,” the paper stated. Many saw this as a form of mockery, and a way of projecting the idea that the women’s protest was an unimportant one. “This mockery and added monetary incentive was a direct attack on the Pempilai Orumai,” the paper stated.\n\nDespite the lack of support from other trade unions, after the women protested for 16 days, the employers agreed to restore an annual bonus of 20% of their annual salary that they paid earlier. The following month, the women protested again to demand a daily wage of Rs 500 – after they protested for 14 days, the employers increased their pay from Rs 231 to Rs 302.\n\nA key problem that women workers face is a lack of women leaders in existing unions.\n\nAbout 100 km from Kozhikode, in the neighbouring district of Kannur, women workers in a government-run farm told Scroll that they had not received their wages for five months. The women work on cashew and rubber plantations on the farm, and were all members of the Centre for Indian Trade Unions. “We’ve complained to everybody, the management, government officials and also CITU,” one of the workers said. '“Nobody has helped us so far.”\n\nWhen asked if they knew any women leaders in CITU whom they could approach, they said they did not. “We don’t know if there are any women in big leadership positions,” one worker said.\n\nSonia George, the general secretary of the Self-Employed Women’s Association, Kerala, noted that while the number of women members in trade unions has increased over the years, even today very few occupied leadership positions. “For example, it is rare to see women become presidents of the unions but they’ll be one of the five vice-presidents,” she said.\n\nShe added, “Since the mainstream trade unions are heavily male-dominated it is very rare to see women have equal representation. Leaders are not consciously thinking of ways to enable the increase in women’s participation in trade unions.”\n\nThe 2018 study also noted that when it came to attendance at state conferences, key annual events organised by trade unions in different states, women made up half the attendees in most states, but that in Kerala’s conferences, they comprised only slightly more than one-third of the attendees. Kerala was also among the states where women comprised less than 10% of the state committee of CITU – these are crucial elected bodies, and include positions such as of president, vice president and general secretary of the union at the state level. According to the 2018 study that analysed CITU’s membership, in Kerala, only 7% of the union’s state committee members were women.\n\n“These details clearly show that in general, the reluctance to elect women to leadership positions continues, particularly in the stronger state committees,” the study stated.\n\nOther studies, focused on specific industries, have found similar trends. An article by the Centre of Public Policy Research about coir workers in Kerala noted that “women are underrepresented in positions of ownership and management in cooperatives, labour unions, and enterprises connected to the coir industry”.\n\nFurther, Neethi argued, trade unions largely function in ways that only suit men. “Worker union meetings and other activities often occur outside work hours or on weekends,” she said. “The care burden and other domestic responsibilities often prevent women from participating in worker-agency activities outside their working space and work hours”\n\nA 2019 paper on women’s participation in trade unions that echoed these arguments found in its analysis that “full participation (of women in trade unions) remains a myth”. It noted, “The masculine structure of the entire industry, lower social acceptance of women’s union activity and existing family responsibilities have made it difficult for women to reach full participation.”\n\nNeethi also pointed out that 95% of working women in the country are engaged in informal work. “In sectors where women’s participation is higher, including garment, construction, and plantations, women get to play primarily supporting roles to supplement the main tasks carried out by male workers,” she said. “They are treated as ‘helpers’ or ‘unpaid family workers’ rather than equal to their male counterparts, which widens the existing gender pay gap in these sectors.”\n\nA 2017 research report, funded by the Kerala State Planning Board, noted that the view of women workers as secondary was so deeply embedded in unions that in 1967, when the Minimum Wages Act was revised, trade unions demanded that “male workers be paid on a monthly basis since it was said they did the vital work and it was reasonable to pay them a high salary”. The unions omitted to include women workers in this demand. “Thus, the demands of the trade unions were not based on an economic rationale but on gender,” the report stated.\n\nThe paper also observed that women were discriminated against in the nature of their employment, and that while men were given continuous employment, women “were classified as temporary or seasonal workers towards whom their employers had less obligations”.\n\nGeorge observed that “It is the men’s income that is seen as primary income”, while women’s income is usually considered “secondary”.\n\nA member of the women’s wing of the All India Trade Union Congress, who asked to remain anonymous, disagreed with the criticism that women were not given an equal platform in trade unions. “At the national level, we have a female general secretary,” she said, referring to Amarjeet Kaur, who became AITUC’s first female general secretary in independent India in 2017. CITU has also had a woman leader – K Hemalatha from Andhra Pradesh was elected as the president in 2016. “AITUC takes women’s concerns very seriously,” the member said.\n\nBut when asked about gender wage gaps in different sectors, she acknowledged that challenges pertaining to gender did exist inside the union. “The union has different branches for different sectors and some are dominated by men,” she said. “The construction workers union is male-dominated, so there hasn’t been much scope for discussion there about the wage gap.”\n\nDespite these significant challenges, on the ground women’s unions have played a crucial role in bringing about changes in women’s working conditions.\n\nAnnamma M, a member of Asanghaditha Mekhala Thozhilali Union and Penkootu, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym, works at a local government office in Kozhikode.\n\nAnnamma struggled for years to get a permanent job at the office. “Only the male members were getting permanent positions and despite many representations to the higher-ups, there were no positive outcomes,” she said. Annamma was a member of the CITU but did not receive any support from the union. “Having a membership at CITU was useless,” she said. “Women don’t have a voice in these unions. They are not allowed to grow. One has to remain in a shell if you join these unions.”\n\nAnnamma heard of Asanghaditha Mekhala Thozhilali Union in 2019 and approached it, seeking support. Along with Viji and other members of the union, Annamma and some of her colleagues went on a 43-day strike, demanding permanent positions. Eventually, senior local officials gave Annamma and some of her protesting colleagues permanent positions – today, she sits in a cabin of her own.\n\nOn other occasions too, such as when she has faced any kind of harassment or bullying in her office, Annamma has approached Asanghaditha Mekhala Thozhilali Union for support. “Any problem I have is immediately resolved,” she said. “It is so important to have a women’s union because nobody can understand our problems like other women do. When trade unions don’t even have women leaders, who do we approach?”\n\nSreedevi Chandran, who works as a sweeper on SM Street, said the establishment of the women’s union has reassured her that she has a support system in place.“If they really trouble us, then we bring Viji to speak with the employers,” Chandran said. “Now, after the women’s union has been formed, the employers are a little scared of us and worry we will go on a protest. So they listen to our demands.”",

    "title": "A new book recommends ten ways for content creators to get long-term loyalty from their audience",
    "authors": ["Varun Mayya", "Achina Sirohi Mayya"],
    "raw_text": "While it may be true that you get paid for the image that pops into people’s minds when they think of you, I think it’s more nuanced than that. There’s no “average sentiment” of what a creator is. Most creators are polarising, and the algorithm is responsible for this. But what this means is that you get paid for the image that pops into the mind of whoever is paying you. For most creators, that’s a brand manager. If you appear often on the feed of a brand manager and they like you, then you have a shot at getting a deal from that brand. If you appear often in the feed of your specific audience and they like you, then they buy from you.\n\nThe first part, “appearing in the feed”, is something you should have a grip on by this point in the book. The second part, “loyalty”, is something that is infinitely harder to create.\n\nHere’s a step-by-step guide on how you can create long-term loyalty:\n\nBe yourself: I know this sounds clichéd, but you can’t put on an act for too long on the internet. The first step in creating long-term loyalty is to be authentic. Viewers can easily detect when someone is putting on a facade, especially on long-form content. Show your true personality, share your interests and be honest in your videos. This helps build a genuine connection with your audience.\n\nConsistency is key: Maintain a consistent tone and style in your content. Whether you’re funny, informative or inspiring, stick to what you’re good at. Consistency helps your audience know what to expect from you, making them more likely to return for more. Many creators want to do ‘multiple things’ on one channel. Don’t do it, however tempting it is, unless it’s on the same topic. You can’t put real estate content on your channel for years and then do a parallel series about AI. Even larger creators split their own interests into multiple channels. Simple rule – if you want to cover two different types of content, then do two separate channels.\n\nEngage with your audience: Take the time to interact with your viewers. Respond to comments, ask for their opinions and include them in your content creation process. This makes them feel valued and part of your channel’s community. Know some of your regular fans by name (or at least username).\n\nTell stories: People love stories. Especially personal stories. Share your experiences, challenges and achievements. Storytelling creates a deeper emotional connection with your audience, making your content more relatable and memorable. The general tendency is for the content creator to gradually show more and more of their personal lives because people want to know. This is only true after you have at least 1,00,000 followers.\n\nShow appreciation: Regularly thank your viewers for their support. I can’t stress this enough. Creators who forget this gain no loyalty. It’s also true that you are only there because of your audience. Some creators get frustrated with the hate comments and trolls and believe everyone is out to get them. They stop respecting their audiences. Don’t do this.\n\nStay true to your values: Never compromise on your core values for views or sponsorships. Your integrity is crucial to maintaining trust with your audience. Early in your career, you will make some mistakes with choosing brands (every creator does). As you get larger, do due diligence on the brands you work with so you can promote their product without worry or guilt. Stay true to what you believe in, and your viewers will respect you for it. Stay away from betting apps.\n\nMeet your fans offline: Some real-world meet and greets are important for audiences to build affinity with you. You should host regular meetups after 1,00,000 subscribers or so. Eventually, decentralise the meetups to a few community heads across the country.\n\nEvolve and grow: While consistency is important, don’t be afraid to evolve. Try new things, and explore different content formats or topics, but keep them aligned with your overall persona and channel theme. Growth shows your audience that you are invested in improving and keeping things interesting for them. Many of our fans come to us years later and say, “Hey, I was one of your first 10,000 subscribers!” People love to see you evolve over time and be there for the journey.\n\nGet in the circle: Being seen with or having the “approval” of an existing mainstream content creator is a good way to be taken seriously. Do not attack other creators as you will not be seen as brand-friendly nor will any large creator work with you. To become relevant, you need them.\n\nCreate content around what you do for a living: People take you a lot more seriously when you do something related to what you make content around. This is why it is rare to see, say, a sixteen-year-old create content around business and be taken seriously by audiences and brands – it feels inauthentic, and you can smell it from miles away.\n\nBut the final “dark arts” tip to true loyalty is to stand for something. A mission. A movement. A revolution. The best movements are driven by primal human emotions.\n\nTo their respective audiences:\n\nSandeep Maheshwari stands for hope.\n\nTanmay Bhat stands for fun and laughter.\n\nBeerBiceps stands for awe and mysticism.\n\nAshneer Grover stands for chaos.\n\nWhile all these people may be hated outside their audience base, all that matters is that their audiences associate them with a core emotion.\n\nExcerpted with permission from The Content Creator Handbook: A Millennial’s Guide to Creating Content, Varun Mayya and Achina Sirohi Mayya, Penguin India.",

    "title": "Prior relationship details, Aadhaar card: What live-in couples must submit under Uttarakhand UCC",
    "authors": ["Vineet Bhalla"],
    "raw_text": "Uttarakhand’s uniform civil code that went into effect on Monday makes it mandatory for couples in live-in relationships to obtain registrations – a process that requires them to give a long list of documents to the state government. This includes their Aadhaar cards, details of previous marital relationships or live-in relationships being terminated and the name and contact of their landlord.\n\nIf they fall within the “degrees of prohibited relationships” under the state’s uniform civil code, which means if they are related by blood, they must get a certificate from a religious leader stating that they are eligible to marry.\n\nLandlords are barred from renting their premises to couples who do not register their live-in relationships. Such couples will face imprisonment of up to three months and a fine up to Rs 10,000 under the code.\n\nThe state government also has the power to reject a plea to live in.\n\nScroll explains how live-in relationships are to be registered in the state.\n\nDocumentary requirements\n\nCouples can register their relationships even if they are not yet living together but intend to. This may be done online on the newly-launched Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code services registration portal or offline, by submitting a 16-page form, along with supporting documents to the registrar for the area.\n\nUnder the code, depending on the area, the sub-divisional magistrate, the municipal commissioner, the chief executive officer of a cantonment board or any officer appointed by them may be the registrar.\n\nBoth partners must furnish an extensive set of documents. These include their photographs, their income tax Permanent Account Number, Aadhaar linked to their phone number and proof of residence or domicile in the state.\n\nRelationship history\n\nThe partners must provide proof of previous marital or live-in relationships, if any. For previous marriages, the partner must provide evidence of divorce or annulment through the decree or certificate number and other specific details of the divorce or annulment. In case of previous live-in relationships, they must provide a termination number. If a former spouse or live-in partner has died, their death certificate must be attached with the application.\n\nThis is also necessary for registering marriages under the code.\n\nIf either of the partners is between 18 and 21 years of age, they must furnish the Aadhaar-linked phone number and address of each of their parents or legal guardians. The registrar must inform the parents or guardians about the relationship being registered, as well as if it gets terminated.\n\nHousing details\n\nIf the partners have already been living together, they must share proof of their shared household. This is limited to the last electricity or water bill. If they are living in rented premises, they must share the full name and contact number of the landlord and a copy of the rent agreement. As per the Uniform Civil Code Rules, the registrar will contact the landlord while verifying the application information.\n\nIn case the partners are not yet living together, they must apply for a provisional certificate. Such a certificate has the same documentary requirements as the final certificate, though without proof required to demonstrate the “shared household”.\n\nOnce the provisional certificate is granted, the couple must find accommodation within the next 30 days, extendable by 15 days. They must then apply for final registration with proof of those premises.\n\nThe rules stipulate that a landlord must ask for a provisional or final registration certificate when leasing out a property to a live-in couple. This certificate will form a part of the rent agreement. Failing to do so will lead to a penalty for the landlord that the government will notify. It has not yet done so.\n\nCouples seeking to register their marriages are not required to share proof of a “shared household”.\n\nThe live-in couple must also provide details and the birth or adoption certificate of their children, if any.\n\nCertificate approving ‘prohibited relationship’\n\nIf the couple is within degrees of prohibited relationships, they must get approval from a religious leader certifying that they are eligible to marry.\n\nThe term “degrees of prohibited relationships” is borrowed from the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The act prohibits marriages between two persons related lineally or by blood unless permitted by local or communal customs.\n\nThis requirement poses an additional hurdle for couples from minority religious backgrounds that are permitted to marry under the personal laws of their communities or even Hindu couples permitted by the local customs exception under the Hindu Marriage Act.\n\nRegistering marriages under the rules has a similar requirement.\n\nUnder the code, only unmarried, heterosexual couples may enter into live-in relationships.\n\nApproval and termination\n\nThe registrar must approve or reject the live-in relationship registration application within 30 days of receiving it. Rejection could be due to false or incomplete information being provided or if the registrar concludes that one of the partners is in the relationship due to force, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation or fraud.\n\nA couple aggrieved by the rejection of their application may appeal before a Registrar General under the code.\n\nThe rules also provide for how a registered live-in relationship must be terminated. The process for this is simpler.\n\nIt may be done bilaterally by both partners or unilaterally by either of them.\n\nThey must provide the date, time and place of termination of the relationship, as well details of any children that the couple may have as well as whether the female partner is pregnant.",

    "raw_text": "I wished to live like a woman. It was destined by nature. My body did not cooperate with my heart as it was subject to nature’s law. I became anxious when I started to grow facial hair. I was disgusted as though my face had been infected. I shaved my face and then all my body hair and wore makeup to conceal my emerging beard. I applied clear coat nail polish on my nails and used women’s perfumes. I would never step out without doing all this. This is how I went to school. I was particular about my feminine appearance precisely because I hated being teased and ridiculed for being effeminate.\n\nBabu offered me a part-time job at his provision store. I would work at Babu’s shop after school and return home at 8 pm I had to work on weekends too. My salary was 500 euros a month, but I would give half of it to my mother. It somewhat relieved my family’s financial crisis.\n\nFor someone feminine like me, it was a challenge to work in that store. The store was frequented by drunks and vagabonds because it sold cigarettes and alcohol. Some of the men who noticed my effeminacy would write down their phone number and give it to me before leaving. Some womanisers would scratch my palm under the pretext of shaking hands. It was a sign that meant “I want to have sex with you”.\n\nThere was a computer at the shop that had an internet connection. I would spend time browsing the internet when there were no customers. Looking for answers to the questions in my heart, I watched documentaries and videos on queer people and transwomen. Most of the documentaries on transwomen were made in Asia or the US. I did not find any information on transwomen living in Germany.\n\nI found some videos on Indian transwomen. In one of these videos, there was a Tamil transwoman named Angel who described the lives and struggles of transwomen in India. Then, I watched a Singapore Tamil television programme about transwomen. A transwoman named Buvana spoke about her life and the challenges she had to face.\n\nBuvana was very beautiful. She spoke fluent Tamil and English. Her voice was just like a woman’s. Buvana was emphatic when she said that transwomen suffer because of their lives as sex workers and that they should leave their jobs. When she described her childhood and her journey, it resembled my own life. I would cry every day watching her videos.\n\nThrough Buvana’s videos, I discovered that anyone could acquire a feminine body with hormonal pills and that one could get gender reassignment surgery done in Thailand. Her words made a bright ladder descend into my prison-like heart that was enveloped in darkness. I was filled with determination to break through all obstacles like Buvana and live like a complete woman.\n\nI also listened to an interview with Sukanya, a Malaysian transwoman. She was interviewed along with her mother. She looked like a beautiful angel with long hair that touched her waist. Sukanya lived with her mother in a large house and they ran a restaurant together. She also did social work. Seeing her life, I was gradually filled with hope and had a grip on the future.\n\nIn 2007, a website reported that someone from Kerala had become Mr Gay Europe. He lived in Hamburg in northern Germany. I thought I should contact him. After a tireless search, I found his email address and emailed him with some questions. I asked him, “Why wouldn’t a gay person like you become a transwoman?” He replied, “I like being a man.” I did not understand his response. But our friendship lasted. I never stopped asking all the queer people I met then why they had not become transwomen.\n\nI once watched a television show on the internet called Ippadikku Rose. The anchor was a beautiful woman whose voice revealed her identity as a transwoman. I searched for anything that I could find on her. She had completed her higher education in the US but was living in Chennai. I sent her an email to introduce myself and ask if I could talk to her. She wrote back to me that very day with her telephone number.\n\nI was unable to suppress my excitement and gave her a call. I quickly told her my entire story. Talking to Rose made me feel ecstatic. It was as if I was talking to God. Rose patiently listened to what I had to say and, like a specialist in the field, spelt out the contradictions that constituted different genders.\n\nShe very patiently said that I was ignorant to think that my wish to become a woman was because of my disappointing sexual relationships. She even said that I was born with a woman’s sensibility and that I was not a homosexual but a woman. She suggested that I complete my education and become a woman. I thought I had finally met my mentor.\n\nI often called her and she slowly dispelled the veils of confusion that had shrouded my heart. I seriously began to think of all the ways I had of becoming a woman. I studied German medical practices that concerned gender reassignment surgeries and their laws on various websites and thought that these laws could not possibly have been formulated by a transwoman.\n\nIf someone who was born a man wanted to become a woman, they would have to consult a psychologist for at least two years. They would have to wear women’s clothes for at least a year. Only then would the psychologist send the person to a doctor who would prescribe hormonal pills and do the gender reassignment surgery. These expenses would be covered by medical insurance. Only after that could one obtain legal documents certifying them to be a woman.\n\nI shared my concerns with my class teacher. “I believe I’m a woman,” I told Clara. “I’m not a homosexual as you think. Can you accept me as a woman?” With tears in her eyes, she embraced me and asked, “What will you do now?” I said that I didn’t know who could help me. Clara recommended a psychologist from Aachen and suggested that I visit him.\n\nI called the psychologist for an appointment. But from our very first meeting, I knew that he knew nothing about transwomen. I still met him for an hour every week. He could not help me, but he listened to my stories without scowling. It was a relief to have someone patiently listen to me.\n\nI became good friends not just with Rose but also with Angel. I frequently spoke to them on the phone. Through our conversations, I learnt of the travails of Indian transwomen. A modern gender reassignment surgery was a fruit that was still out of their reach.\n\nIn those days, there were two ways in which Indian transwomen could transition. There was a ritual called nirvanam that was performed to get rid of the penis. The first way of severing the penis was called tayamma kai. The transwoman would give offerings to their goddess, Santhoshi Mata, along with the other transwomen before their penis and testicles were severed with a razor before a picture of the goddess. The one who severed the penis was known as a tayamma in the transwomen community. When Rose told me about this, my body shivered. I could not understand how they could sever the genitalia without any medical assistance.\n\nThe second way was for a doctor to remove the penis and testicles after putting the transwoman under anaesthesia. Whichever method was used to remove the genitalia, an orifice was left through which the transwoman could urinate. However, they could no longer have sex with a woman.\n\nRose told me that she was going to undergo a modern gender reassignment surgery in Thailand. I longed for the day when I would have the same surgery. I was confronted by a sense of emptiness. My male genitalia was an unwanted thing that hung from my body like a heavy burden.\n\nTime was indifferent to my sorrow as it flew past. I scored o the highest marks in my annual exams in 2007 and was given an award for being the best student at school. The news was even published in the local newspapers and some of the customers who visited Babu’s store congratulated me. But it made no impression on my family. While others celebrated my success, my father continued to thrash me.\n\nMy brother always ridiculed me and called me names and my mother remained indifferent. My sister was far away. My family made no attempt to understand me.\n\nInstead, they harassed me by insisting that I behave like a man. They wanted me to cut my hair short and not wear makeup. The more they did this, the stronger became my desire to live like a woman. I would go shopping with my female friends from school and buy dresses. Later, I’d secretly hide them in my cupboard. When I was in the bathroom, I would dress up like a woman.\n\nExcerpted with permission from Thanuja: A Memoir of Migration and Transition, Thanuja Singam, translated from the Tamil by Kiran Keshavamurthy, Bloomsbury India.",

    "raw_text": "Salim Mira Moideen Shaikh was one of the strongest men in the D-Company. He was also always ready for a fight. Due to his rabid nature and dark complexion, he was nicknamed Salim Kutta. He was a native of Kotta Nellore in Tamil Nadu. In Mumbai, he was involved in rioting cases.\n\n“But how did Salim get involved in the blasts?” I asked. His name also evoked a reaction from Neeraj Kumar, who had conducted a cross-border operation to arrest him; a surgical arrest in the mid-1990s, for sure, if not a strike.\n\nSalim Kutta used to be a bodyguard for the Dossa family. Mohammad Dossa used to help Salim with medical expenses and gained the latter’s undying loyalty. Salim’s violent nature was of good use for Dossa. In the late 1980s, Salim was also part of a gang known as the “Arjun” gang which was modelled after the gang led by Sunny Deol in his superhit film of the same name. This gang also had the blessings of Mustafa Dossa aka Mustafa Majnu. By 1992, Salim was firmly entrenched in Mohammad Dossa’s good books. Members of the Arjun gang were also sent to Pakistan for training in the usage of arms and ammunition.\n\nWhile Neeraj Kumar was investigating the bombings, he was hell-bent on chasing down those who played a key role in the bombings.\n\nSalim had participated in landing the arms and ammunition at the Gosabara Coast in Gujarat. These were used for the Black Friday bombings in 1993. Hence, he was on the radar of the Gujarat Police. The Gujarat landings were orchestrated by Mustafa Dossa, whereas two other landings were organized by Tiger Memon at Dighi and Shekhadi coasts in Raigad district of Maharashtra. Thus, Salim Kutta became a natural target for Neeraj Kumar.\n\nAfter weeks of waiting, things heated up with the arrival of an intelligence report at the CBI headquarters in New Delhi. Holding the INTREP in his hands, and reading it over and over again, Neeraj Kumar (then joint director of the CBI) made a concrete effort to keep his zeal in control.\n\nThe CBI Headquarters had pint-sized cabins for members of their Special Task Force who were investigating the blasts. The walls of those cabins were so thin that officers seated in adjacent cabins could hear each other’s conversations even if they were top secret! For this precise reason, Kumar resisted the urge to call his juniors to his cabin and brief them about the report which had come from India’s top agency – the famed Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW).\n\nAccording to the report, dreaded terrorist Salim Kutta, an accused in the Bombay bomb blasts, was said to be working at a grocery shop named “Abhinandan” in Kathmandu. There were also reports of two other accused, Shabir and Firoz, who were said to be spotted around the same area in Kathmandu. Neeraj Kumar stifled a chuckle. Who could have imagined that a most wanted man from the D-Company would be hiding in a grocery shop in Nepal’s capital?\n\nIn all honesty, Kumar expected this intel to turn out to be another dud, the likes of which would get thrown at them with abandon in this game of cops and criminals. Now he had two options. To put in a half-hearted attempt or go all in. He gave it some serious thought and allowed his policeman’s instincts to take over. Finally, he decided to take a leap of faith.\n\nBut there was one problem in going after Salim Kutta. Though he oversaw the STF, Kumar lacked the manpower he would need to arrest Kutta if the intel was legit. The CBI is a tremendously understaffed organization suffering from a perennial crunch in resources.\n\nKumar was aware that his batchmate from the IPS academy, Kuldeep Sharma, who was currently working with Gujarat Police, was also on the lookout for Salim Kutta as the criminal had taken part in landing explosives and ammunition on the coast of Gujarat.\n\nSince they had trained together at the police academy, Kumar decided to team up with Kuldeep Sharma and launch an operation to arrest Salim. Another officer from the Jammu and Kashmir cadre was chosen by Kumar as a part of the CBI team for this mission.\n\nThe joint team reached Kathmandu and camped at the Annapoorna Hotel while awaiting formal approval from the Nepal government to commence their operation.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the CBI is barred from carrying out any secret operations that are not sanctioned by the government. This is the direct result of the diplomacy involved between the two countries and the fact that the CBI reports directly to the Central government. Misadventures or even the slightest of mistakes of the CBI can cause direct embarrassment to the prime minister’s office. Kumar was bound to the established protocol and procedures.\n\nThe red tape of bureaucracy began taking its toll. As with any kind of government work, there was an inordinate amount of delay in procuring the requisite approvals. Kumar was getting edgier by the minute. What if Salim got wind of their plans? If he escaped now, tracking him again would prove to be a monumental task.\n\nKumar decided to act. He took along his CBI subordinates and a sub-inspector from Nepal Police down the streets of Kathmandu in a private vehicle. He wanted to inspect the location of the Abhinandan grocery shop where the three suspects (Salim, Shabir and Firoz) were supposedly working.\n\nThe team finally reached a spot from where they could keep an eye on the shop but they were still unsure of the presence of their quarry. Kumar spotted a telephone booth located right in front of the shop. On the pretext of making a call, Kumar entered the booth to get a closer look at the people inside the store. Much to Kumar’s surprise, a tall, muscled man was seated at the counter of the shop. From the photographs sent by the R&AW, Kumar recognized the man as none other than Salim Kutta!\n\nExcerpted with permission from From Dubai To Karachi: The Dawood Saga Continues, S Hussain Zaidi, Penguin India.",

    "authors": ["Ayush Tiwari"],
    "raw_text": "If you have made a phone call in India recently, it is likely you have heard this recorded message: “Careful! If you are getting a video call from the police, customs, the CBI or a judge through an unknown number, don’t be afraid. They might be cybercriminals. Report them on the national cyber helpline number 1930 immediately.”\n\nThe message is from the home ministry. The reason why the government is warning Indians about cyberfrauds is because they have exploded exponentially.\n\nFrom 71 cybercrime complaints registered every day in 2019, the number shot up 87 times in 2024 to 6,175 complaints a day.\n\nIndians lost Rs 11,333 crore to cyberscams in just nine months last year, according to the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre, an agency attached to the home ministry. That’s $1.3 billion.\n\nWhile this number looks mind-boggling, it is just a small fraction of the global cyberscam industry’s estimated annual takings of nearly $40 billion.\n\nAt the helm of this industry are Chinese crime syndicates that operate out of Southeast Asia, mainly Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos. They run highly-equipped “scam compounds” staffed with people from across Asia and Africa who are lured with fake job offers. These people are then threatened and forced into scamming people back home by assuming fake online identities as globe-trotting women, bank employees and police officials.\n\nAccording to a report released by the United States Institute of Peace in May 2024, the annual returns from cyberscams are estimated at $12.5 billion in Cambodia, $15.3 billion in Myanmar, and $10.9 billion in Laos – nearly 40% of the combined GDP of the three countries.\n\nIn this special series, we track the full arc of this terrifying story in which even the scamsters are victims. We report on people who lost their lifetime savings to cyberfrauds, as well as the Indians who went to Southeast Asia and were trapped as cyberslaves to carry out these scams. In the final part of the series, we take you to ground zero of the cyberscam industry – the first ever such report in the Indian media.\n\nBut first, essential background on how the industry sprung up and evolved – and how Indians became its targets.\n\nThe Chinese hand\n\nThe story starts in Cambodia, according to Nathan Paul Southern, who works at the Eye Witness Project, a research consultancy that investigates organised crime and corruption.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, the country saw a massive influx of Chinese investment as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, a geopolitical strategy aimed at increasing China’s influence across Asia and Africa. This created an opportunity for gambling businesses in China, where online gambling is banned, to move to Cambodia where they opened casinos in cities like Sihanoukville.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2019, the number of casinos in Cambodia increased from 57 to 150, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nChinese crime syndicates linked to online gambling operators also entered the fray, using the high volume of cross-border money transfers in Cambodia’s casinos to launder illicit funds.\n\nIn 2019, Cambodia banned online gambling – a setback for the casinos. Months later, the Covid-19 pandemic struck, forcing the casinos to shut down. “Criminal organisations did not have a way to make revenue,” Southern said. “They quickly turned this empty real estate into cyberscam compounds.”\n\nIn cities like Sihanoukville, syndicates pay up to a million dollars a month in rent to casinos for running scam centres inside these premises, according to a Cambodian journalist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nMany of these compounds, according to extensive reporting in the international media, are owned by oligarchs close to Hun Sen, president of the Cambodian People’s Party, who has been in power since 1979.\n\nThis partly explains why the Cambodian government has turned a blind eye to the rise of organised cybercrime in the country, Southern told Scroll. The government initially dismissed reports of trafficking and confinement as mere “labour disputes”. But international pressure forced it to crack down on some of the scam compounds in 2022.\n\nAnd yet, as we found on the ground, cybercrime still flourishes in Cambodia. More about this in the final part of the series.\n\nCambodia is not the only Southeast Asian country to succumb to the blood money of cybercrime. Myanmar and Laos have followed in its footsteps.\n\nIn 2021, Myanmar witnessed a coup, with the military dislodging a democratically-elected government. Emboldened by these developments, armed groups allied to the military widened their human trafficking and cyberscam rackets in the country’s border towns, according to the United States Institute of Peace.\n\nScam compounds flourished in Shan state, bordering China, and in Karen state, bordering Thailand. In late 2023, under pressure from the Chinese government, an armed group in Shan cracked down on Chinese cybercriminals and repatriated them to China. As a result, cyberscam operators from Shan were forced to move to Karen state in the south, or to Cambodia and Laos.\n\nToday, Karen is a hotbed of scam compounds where hundreds of Indians have been trafficked since 2022. Historically, the Myanmar military has had little control over the province. It has governed it by proxy, through an ethnic armed group called the Karen Border Guard Force, or BGF, which runs an illicit economy of mining and trade in the province.\n\nAnother armed group operating scam compounds in the region is the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, or DKBA. An official at the Indian Embassy in Yangon said that the DKBA has a fraught relationship with the Myanmar military, unlike the BGF, making the rescues of Indians harder from their territory. Their compounds also report higher instances of assault and torture, the official added.\n\nIn Laos, the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone, an enclave built over 7,000 acres at the intersection of Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, became the hub of cyberscam operations, partly due to its tax incentives, trade benefits and easy regulations.\n\nThe enclave was created in 2007 by the Laos government in partnership with a corporate group registered in Hong Kong and owned by Chinese businessman Zhao Wei. Despite facing US sanctions for “drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, bribery, and wildlife trafficking”, Wei has been recipient of several national honours by the Laotian government.\n\nBorders and elites\n\nThere is a reason why compounds in Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos came up mostly in regions along the Thailand border. “It is easy to traffic foreign workers into Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia through major hubs like Bangkok,” Jacob Sims, an expert on transnational crime and human rights in Southeast Asia, told Scroll.\n\n“The Myawaddy compounds in Myanmar have all likely been constructed via materials brought over from Thailand,” he added. “Historically, they were also getting their internet and electricity from Thailand.”\n\nSouthern said that scam compounds across these three countries are “interconnected and run similarly”. “The bosses of compounds in Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar are on the same Telegram groups,” he said. “They sell and exchange people for the scam operations and discuss services like money laundering.”\n\nIn 2023, the UN Human Rights Office estimated that nearly 2.2 lakh people “may be held in situations where they are forced to carry out online scams” in Cambodia and Myanmar. This includes thousands of Indians.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in these countries have been lax in cracking down on these criminal groups because the incentives were stacked in their favour. “Ample evidence suggests that protection of the scamming industry is now of strategic interest to the ruling elites in Myanmar, Cambodia, and other countries in the region due to the industry’s profitability and the nature of state involvement,” said the United States Institute of Peace report.\n\nTargeting Indians\n\nWhile the scam industry has flourished in Southeast Asia since 2020, India became a target more recently. This is partly because public outrage in China forced Chinese law enforcement to clamp down on cyberscam operations in Southeast Asia. China’s crackdown pushed the syndicates to expand their horizons to other countries, including India.\n\n“What the Chinese have actually said is that these operations need to stop targeting the Chinese back in China,” explained Southern. “So the criminal groups evolved and started targeting English-speaking countries, specifically the US, UK, and also India.”\n\nThe shift is evident in the data: cybercrime shot up in India starting 2022.\n\nAccording to the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre, the agency functioning under the home ministry, 45% of the 12 lakh cyberscam complaints registered between January and September 2024 dealt with crimes originating from Southeast Asia.\n\nThe most terrifying of these crimes is the ‘digital arrest’ scam, where scammers pose as law enforcement officials over the phone and isolate their victims by putting them under ‘digital arrest’ on the pretext of a fabricated crime. They then demand a huge sum to release them.\n\nAlthough it only made headlines in India in 2024, this type of scam was used to target Thai citizens as far back as 2022.\n\nRecruiting Indians\n\nTo scam Indians, Southeast Asia’s cybercriminals have had to recruit people from India. This has proved to be rather easy. India’s vast English-speaking population, combined with high unemployment levels and lack of quality jobs for educated youth, makes Indians extremely vulnerable to human trafficking.\n\nThe syndicates rely on local recruitment agents to lure people to scam compounds with fake jobs, government officials trying to combat Southeast Asia’s cybercriminals told Scroll. “I am surprised by how well [the scamsters] know India’s laws, especially banking and taxation,” an official said, on the condition of anonymity. “The syndicates hire Indian consultants who help them solve problems, like how to launder scam proceeds to their region.”\n\nThe official added that individuals connected to the syndicates also travel to India to groom recruiters.\n\nIn November 2024, Scroll got in touch with a recruiter working for a scam compound in Laos. He was an Indian man from Delhi who was looking for a “computer operator” for a firm called Unity Services in the Golden Triangle SEZ.\n\nThe position came with a monthly pay of Rs 65,000-Rs 70,000 and offered accommodation, meals and “medical coverage”, among other things. The terms and conditions of the job listed a probationary period of one year and proficiency in English.\n\nRecruiters have three distinct methods to trap their victims. First is through social media platforms. The recruiter in Laos posts job openings on Facebook through a front company. He uses fake accounts pretending to be young women and posts in groups meant to connect employers with potential employees, like “Madhya Pradesh Jobs”, “Pune Job Seekers” and “Overseas Jobs Consultancy”. The posts are regularly deleted and new ones are put up.\n\nOnce in touch, interested employees are asked to share a minute-long video introduction in English. If they qualify, they must share their passport details, a local ID and a photograph and their educational qualifications. The recruiter shares an offer letter, books the tickets, and the employee has to join within weeks.\n\nThe second way is recruiters duping neighbours, friends and acquaintances. Scroll interviewed seven victims in Uttar Pradesh and Kerala who had been rescued after being trapped in compounds in Southeast Asia. All of them personally knew their recruiters, who were their former colleagues, neighbours or school friends.\n\nThey were sold on lucrative jobs in Thailand and Malaysia, but were instead transported to notorious casino towns in neighbouring Myanmar and Cambodia.\n\nThe third method involves compromised travel agencies. Traditionally, these agencies place their clients in firms across the world, like Canada or West Asia. The compromised agencies advertise quality jobs in Southeast Asia and instead pack away their clients to scam compounds.\n\nFor instance, in October 2024, the National Investigation Agency chargesheeted five men for using a firm called Ali International Services in Sarai Julena, Delhi, as a front for a “cyber fraud and human trafficking racket” in Laos, where their victims were forced to target Europeans and Americans through cyber scams.\n\nEmbassy rescues\n\nAs the volume of online cyberscams soared in India, the country’s embassies in Southeast Asia battled the other end of the crisis: they were besieged with calls seeking their help in rescuing Indians trapped in cyberscam centres.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, the Indian government rescued 2,358 Indians from scam compounds in Southeast Asia, according to data presented by the Ministry of External Affairs in the Rajya Sabha in November 2024 – 1,091 of them were rescued from Cambodia, 770 from Laos and 497 from Myanmar.\n\nThe first Indian embassy to sound a public alarm was the one in Yangon. In an advisory issued in July 2022, it said that it had “observed in the recent past” that technology companies in the “remote eastern border areas of Myanmar” were entrapping Indian workers “on the pretext of potential employment opportunities in the IT sector”.\n\nIn September 2022, the embassy in Phnom Penh said that there had been a “gradual increase” in Indians getting trapped by criminal syndicates in Cambodia and forced to commit online fraud, often under “constant physical and mental torture”.\n\nBut it was only after the exponential growth in cybercrime in 2024 that New Delhi went into high gear. In May 2024, the home ministry published an alert on “digital arrest” scams which it said were “learnt to be operated by cross-border crime syndicates”. Days later, the I4C chief, Rajesh Kumar, summoned journalists in Delhi and briefed them about India’s latest cybersecurity crisis.\n\nIndia also brought up the issue in international forums. In July 2024, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met U Than Swe, deputy prime minister of Myanmar, on the sidelines of a foreign ministers’ retreat. He tweeted that he had “pressed strongly for the early return of Indians unlawfully detained by cyber scam gangs”.\n\nThe same month, while attending an ASEAN forum, Jaishankar said he had taken up the matter with the Laotian Prime Minister and the foreign ministers of Cambodia and Thailand.\n\nIn October 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned about digital arrest scams in a Mann Ki Baat broadcast. “There is no system like digital arrest in the law, this is just a fraud, deceit, it is a lie, a gang of criminals and those who are doing this are enemies of society,” he said.\n\nAnd yet, New Delhi remains cautious in how it navigates the cybercrime crisis with Southeast Asian countries. According to observers, India’s larger priority in the region is to compete with a dominant Beijing, and is keen to not upset Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia.\n\nOn the ground in Cambodia, an Indian official spelt out the dilemma: “While it is not our intention to depict Cambodia in a poor light, we are forced to take all possible steps to prevent young Indians from being trapped in cyber crimes and cheat thousands of other Indian nationals of their hard earned money.”\n\nBut the bigger challenge for the Indian government lies at home, not outside. “Unemployment in India is a bit too much,” a young man from Uttar Pradesh told us. He was trafficked to Myanmar, where he was tortured and forced to scam Indians over several months before he managed to escape.\n\nHe explained why young people like him were willing to take up risky jobs in Southeast Asia. “My father is getting old and I want to be able to support my family,” he said. “Do you think someone who makes Rs 15,000 a month can survive easily?”\n\nThis is the first in a four-part series on Indians being targeted by Southeast Asia’s cybercrime syndicates.",

    "authors": ["Scroll Staff"],
    "raw_text": "Delhi’s former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday accused Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini of committing a crime by “sending poisonous water to Delhi and trying to create an artificial water crisis”, reported The Indian Express.\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party leader said he was being targeted by the Election Commission for raising concerns about the contamination of Delhi’s water supply.\n\nKejriwal, accompanied by Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and Delhi Chief Minister Atishi, appeared before the Election Commission to submit his response to a second notice regarding his claim that Haryana was releasing contaminated water into the Yamuna.\n\nThe poll panel later stated that it had received Kejriwal’s reply and would examine it “in detail” before taking a decision “on merit”.\n\n“The Commission gave a patient hearing to AAP leader Sh Kejriwal, at a very short notice today & received his reply,” the Election Commission said on social media. “The Full Commission, without getting swayed by personal insinuations & offensive strategy being in play, decided to examine reply in detail & take decision(s) on merit.”\n\nThe controversy began on January 27 when Kejriwal shared a video of Delhi Chief Minister Atishi alleging that the Bharatiya Janata Party was conspiring to poison the city’s drinking water. The next day, Atishi cited a letter from the Delhi Jal Board’s chief executive officer, which stated that while the city’s water treatment plants could handle ammonia levels up to one part per million, contamination in the Yamuna river exceeded permissible limits.\n\nHowever, the Delhi Jal Board later contradicted Kejriwal’s claim, calling it “factually incorrect” and “misleading”. The board stated that ammonia levels in the river naturally rise between October and February.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Haryana government filed a first information report against Kejriwal for making the allegations. The Election Commission, responding to a complaint from the Bharatiya Janata Party, issued a notice to Kejriwal seeking evidence for his claims.\n\nThe poll panel said a preliminary assessment suggested Kejriwal’s remarks could promote “disharmony and enmity between groups” and asked him to submit a “specific and pointed reply” by Friday.\n\nAhead of his meeting with the chief election commissioner on Friday, Kejriwal told reporters: “Atishi and Bhagwant Mann wrote a letter to the Election Commission raising the issue and asking them to step in. The Election Commission did not take any action… Instead, I was served with a notice for raising my voice.”\n\nIn his formal response, Kejriwal on Friday reiterated that his allegation was based on “dangerously high levels of ammonia contamination” in Delhi’s water supply as per the Delhi Jal Board chief executive officer’s statement dated January 27.\n\nCalling the Election Commission’s “refusal” to direct Haryana to stop polluting Delhi’s waters “baffling,” Kejriwal accused the poll panel of “omission and negligence of corrupt practices by the Bharatiya Janata Party”.\n\n“My only concern is the health and safety of the people of Delhi, and I will fight for the protection of our democratic principles,” he wrote. “Whatever illegal punishment you may wish to impose on me under the instruction of the Bharatiya Janata Party is a small price to pay for it, and I welcome it with open arms.”\n\nThe Delhi Assembly elections are scheduled for February 4, with votes to be counted on February 8.",

    "title": "Why a Christian pastor was denied a burial in his own village by India’s Supreme Court",
    "authors": ["Vineet Bhalla"],
    "raw_text": "Can a person be denied a burial in his own village on the basis of his faith?\n\nYes.\n\nThat is essentially the conclusion the Supreme Court reached on Monday as it rejected Ramesh Baghel’s plea to bury his father in their native village of Chhindwada in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district. The village’s Hindu residents had opposed this because Baghel’s father is Christian.\n\nThe Supreme Court was hearing an appeal to the Chhattisgarh High Court’s order which had held that Baghel’s father could not be buried in the village. While the two-judge bench reached a split verdict, with one judge strongly upholding Baghel’s rights on the grounds of secularism, in the end, the court arrived at a compromise that favoured the status quo.\n\nBaghel was ordered to bury his father in a different village, as had been demanded by the Hindu residents of Chhindwada.\n\nA family tradition\n\nBaghel, a third-generation Christian belonging to the New Apostolic Church, lives in his ancestral village of Chhindwada. He is from the the Mahra caste. Chhindwada, according to court records, has a population of 6,450, of which 6,000 are Adivasi and 450 belong to the Mahra community. About 100 members of the Mahra community are Christian while the rest are Hindu.\n\nBaghel’s father, a pastor at the local church, died on January 7 after a prolonged illness.\n\nFollowing his family tradition, Ramesh Baghel wanted his father to be buried in the village graveyard. However, his plan faced violent resistance from the villagers. “Any person who has forsworn the tradition of the community or has converted into a Christian is not allowed to be buried at the village graveyard,” said an affidavit by Bastar’s additional superintendent of police filed with the Supreme Court.\n\nThis communal tension between Christians and Hindus has arisen only in the last few years in Chhindwada, the affidavit said. As a result, “every time a member of Mahra Christian community dies, the police reach at the place of occurrence of death so as to avoid any heated exchange between the parties and to help them to find a solution or a common ground in case any dispute arises between the parties”, the judgement reads.\n\nEven the family’s private agricultural plot was deemed off-limits for the burial due to communal hostility. The local authorities, including the police and the gram panchayat, offered no assistance.\n\nLeft with no choice, the family had to move the body to a mortuary in Jagdalpur, about 30 km from their village.\n\nMoving court\n\nBaghel then approached the Chhattisgarh High Court. He argued that Christian members of his family, including his grandfather and aunt, had been buried in the village graveyard without objections. He pointed to a portion of the Mahra community graveyard that had been informally designated for Christian burials, based on oral permissions from the gram panchayat.\n\nHowever, the High Court dismissed Baghel’s plea. It cited the absence of a formally designated Christian graveyard in Chhindwada and pointed to a Christian burial ground that existed in Karkapal, about 20 km away.\n\nThe court reasoned that allowing the burial in Chhindwada could lead to unrest and public disharmony and directed that Baghel’s father be buried in Karkapal.\n\nDiscriminatory move\n\nBaghel appealed this decision in the Supreme Court. He argued that the refusal to allow his father’s burial in Chhindwada was discriminatory and violated his family’s religious and cultural rights. He also contended that the High Court had ignored longstanding burial practices in the village.\n\nThe Chhattisgarh government defended the High Court’s ruling. It claimed that the village was predominantly Adivasi and that its burial ground was designated for “deceased persons belonging to the Hindu Tribal Community”.\n\nThe state maintained that the burial ground in Karkapal was adequate for Christians from Chhindwada and neighbouring villages. It also warned that allowing the burial in Chhindwada could lead to public order problems.\n\nSecularism vs public order\n\nThe matter was heard by a two judge bench comprising Justices BV Nagarathna and SC Sharma. Each delivered differing opinions, reflecting contrasting approaches to the complex balance between personal rights and community norms.\n\nNagarathana emphasised equality, secularism and fraternity and reflected on the judiciary’s role in safeguarding minority rights. The “social ostracisation” of Baghel’s family, she wrote, “indicates a betrayal of the sublime principles of secularism and the glorious traditions of our country which believes in Sarva Dharma Samanvaya/Sarva Dharma Samabhava which is the essence of secularism”.\n\nNagarathana held that “discrimination and prejudice” had driven the actions of the authorities in denying Baghel burial space. “Such an attitude on the part of respondents [executive authorities] betrays their responsibility towards all citizens residing in the village and smacks of hostile discrimination and divisiveness and gives an impression that certain sections of the village can be discriminated against,” she argued.\n\nCiting the constitutional principle of secularism, she held that it is “incumbent on all citizens as well as institutions, whether of governance or otherwise, to foster fraternity amongst the citizens”.\n\nNagarathna ruled in favour of Baghel. She noted that Christian burials had been taking place in the village for decades, supported by oral permissions from the gram panchayat. Photographic evidence and affidavits from villagers corroborated this practice. She also took note of the fact that no Christian residents of Chhindwada had previously been buried in Karkapal.\n\nShe ordered that Baghel could bury his father on his private agricultural land in Chhindwada. To prevent future conflicts, she directed the state to designate Christian burial grounds across Chhattisgarh within two months.\n\nOn the other hand, Sharma prioritised public order and adhering to written rules in denying Baghel’s request. He cited the Chhattisgarh Gram Panchayat Rules, 1999, which require burials to occur in officially designated areas. He noted that there was no officially designated burial site for Christians in Chhindwada. He argued that these rules were essential for maintaining public health and community harmony.\n\nWhile acknowledging the family’s right to a dignified burial, Sharma maintained that this right does not include an unqualified choice of burial site. He upheld the High Court’s decision, ruling that the burial should take place in Karkapal’s designated Christian burial ground. He emphasised that overriding state regulations could set a dangerous precedent and lead to further disputes.\n\nCompromise verdict\n\nIn cases of split verdicts by a two-judge bench, the norm is to refer the matter to the chief justice, who then places the matter before a three-judge bench.\n\nHowever, the senior judge on the bench, Nagarathna, refrained from doing so. Instead, she and Sharma arrived at a common order “in order to accord an expeditious and dignified burial” of the pastor.\n\nAs a result, the court ordered Baghel to bury his father in the Christian burial ground in Karkapal, putting in place arrangements for police protection. Conspicuous by its absence from the final verdict was the direction from Nagarathna’s order that the state government and local authorities demarcate grave yards for Christians throughout the state.\n\nEffectively, then, the High Court’s judgement remained upheld. Sharma’s view practically became the compromise order as the Supreme Court upheld the objection of some of Chhindwada’s residents to allowing a Christian to be buried in the village.",

    "title": "Why the push by India’s tiger conservation body to relocate forest-dwellers is contentious",
    "authors": ["Vaishnavi Rathore"],
    "raw_text": "On January 10, a letter from the Union tribal affairs ministry to all states brought back into the spotlight a fraught question: the relocation of forest-dwellers, ostensibly to protect wildlife.\n\nThe ministry’s letter noted that under the Forest Rights Act, such communities could not be “evicted or removed from forest land they occupy until the process of recognition and verification of their rights is complete”.\n\nWhile the question of such relocation has been debated for decades, the ministry’s letter was a response to a relatively recent development, dating to June 2024.\n\nThat month, the National Tiger Conservation Authority sent a letter to 19 states, calling for the relocation of almost 65,000 families living inside critical tiger habitats across 53 tiger reserves on a “priority basis”. The letter noted that the “progress of village relocation is very slow and it poses grave concern in light of tiger conservation”.\n\nSeveral organisations and gram sabhas wrote to the NTCA, the ministry of tribal affairs, and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, demanding that this letter be withdrawn. They argued that such relocation would violate laws meant to protect the rights of forest dwellers. They added that they were particularly concerned that relocation would be carried out without the payment of fair compensation.\n\nIn its January letter, the tribal affairs ministry acknowledged these concerns. It observed that forest-dwelling communities had a wide range of rights under the Forest Rights Act and the Wildlife Protection Act, and directed states to develop an “institutional mechanism” to “ensure compliance” with these rights before relocation.\n\nFor instance, under the Forest Rights Act, before a forest-dwelling community is relocated, the free and informed consent of the appropriate gram sabha has to be procured.\n\nThe Wildlife Protection Act, too, prescribes certain protections before a community is relocated in the interest of protecting wildlife – such as that “an independent ecological and social scientist familiar with the area has to come to a conclusion that other reasonable options of co-existence” are not feasible.\n\nExperts see the tribal affairs ministry’s intervention as a step in the right direction. At the same time, they argue, the fundamental problems with the NTCA’s actions remain unaddressed. “The root of the problem, the NTCA letter prioritising relocation, still exists,” said Tushar Dash, a forest rights researcher.\n\nDash and other experts argued that this problem was a part of a larger pattern, of the NTCA taking decisions that bypassed communities’ rights over forests – at the same time, they added, the body was not doing enough to fulfill its central function of protecting tiger habitats.\n\nScroll emailed the NTCA, seeking its responses to the criticisms that had been made of its functioning. This story will be updated if it responds.\n\nThe NTCA and its mandate\n\nThe NTCA is a statutory body whose members include representatives from the tribal affairs and environment ministry, as well as independent wildlife experts.\n\nThe authority was constituted by a 2006 amendment of the Wildlife Protection Act. The amendment designated the NTCA with 11 functions pertaining to tiger conservation. For instance, it was to ensure that no ecologically unsustainable use of land occurred within tiger reserves, lay down standards for tourism activities in these areas and maintain estimates of tiger populations in different regions.\n\nThe amendment also gave NTCA the power to issue directions to “any person, officer or authority” to ensure that tigers were protected. But it added an important caveat: that “no such direction shall interfere with or affect the rights of local people particularly the scheduled tribes”.\n\nBut experts point out that through its letters and directions, the NTCA has repeatedly bypassed provisions of laws meant to protect people’s rights to forests, and ensure fair relocation from tiger reserves. “NTCA is working beyond the mandate provided for it in its parent law, the law from where it gets its powers,” Dash said.\n\nIn a 2022 research paper, Asmita Kabra and Budhaditya Das examined official communication between 1972 and 2018 between the environment ministry, tribal ministry and the NTCA, as well as forest department officials across the country.\n\nThey found that in 2007, after the Forest Rights Act was enacted to protect the rights of those who live in or use forests, including protected areas, the NTCA directed the administrations of all protected areas to finalise and delineate “inviolate critical tiger habitats” – areas designated for tiger conservation. It asked officials to “to accord topmost priority to this task”.\n\nThe NTCA’s move to create inviolate spaces was not necessarily in conflict with its mandate, “since it is the role of the authority to protect tigers and their habitats”, noted Akshay Chettri, an independent conservation policy researcher. But, he argued, “when it says in its letter that these processes should be expedited, as soon as possible, or prioritised, without asking states to follow the due procedures meant for safeguarding communities’ rights according to the Wildlife Protection Act, then that is in violation of its own mandate”.\n\nRelocation over forest rights\n\nThe NTCA’s efforts towards relocation have been similarly contentious. In 2008, the same year that the tribal ministry began implementing the Forest Rights Act across forest areas, the NTCA announced a voluntary relocation scheme from critical tiger habitats and issued guidelines for it.\n\nUnder the guidelines, any family residing within a tiger reserve would be paid a cash compensation of Rs 10 lakh to relocate to an area outside it. (This amount was increased to Rs 15 lakh in 2021.) Alternatively, the family could receive smaller amounts of money, and instead receive different kinds of rehabilitation support, such as allocation of agricultural land or assistance with the construction of a house.\n\nKabra and Das noted that the process by which forest-dwelling communities could secure the benefits of their rights under the FRA would be “long and tedious”. Thus, accepting the offer of money to relocate would have seemed to them like the only viable option, they argued.\n\nFor many forest dwellers, it became “their only realistic chance to access hitherto-denied benefits of development”, they wrote, adding that the families faced an “unenviable choice between an immediate cash transfer versus a protracted and uncertain struggle for rights”.\n\nOver the next decade, the tribal ministry repeatedly raised concerns that the rights of forest dwellers were not being recognised, Kabra and Das found. For instance, in 2010, it wrote to the environment ministry that “no action has been taken by state governments for recognition of rights of forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes in the national parks and sanctuaries”. Kabra and Das also quoted a 2015 letter where the ministry noted that “FRA was not being implemented in sanctuaries and national parks and relocation was taking place without completion of FRA process”.\n\nBut, as Kabra and Das noted, the NTCA continued to take “several measures to delay and circumvent the implementation of the Forest Rights Act”. At the same time, it also wrote letters to state bureaucracies, directing them to take steps under the Wildlife Protection Amendment Act that, experts argued, would be detrimental to communities living inside the tiger habitats – such as creating inviolate tiger habitats, free of any human activity.\n\nIn fact, it only seemed to double down on its approach. In 2017, the NTCA wrote to all states with land under tiger reserves, directing that forest rights not be granted to any families in reserves. It stated, “no rights shall be conferred in critical tiger habitat”.\n\nAs a result, several states paused the process of recognition of forest rights of communities in such areas. In Maharashtra’s Tadoba, local gram sabhas found through filing right-to-information requests that the FRA process was paused as a result of the 2017 guidelines. Researchers heard of a similar situation in Odisha’s Simlipal also. In Jharkhand’s Palamu, forest rights claims of 61 Adivasis were rejected repeatedly as a result of the 2017 guidelines.\n\nThe National Commission for Scheduled Tribe made note of the fact that the NTCA had trampled on the forest rights of these families. In a meeting in October 2018, the commission said that it “strongly feels” that the 2017 letter was “in complete violation” of both the Forest Rights Act and the Wildlife Protection Act. The minutes of a meeting of the commission that month, which Scroll has seen, note that the body observed that these letters “have created hindrance to the statutory provisions in the FRA”, and recommended, “all these NTCA letters should be withdrawn immediately”.\n\nFollowing this, the NTCA appeared to moderate its approach. In 2018, Kabra and Das wrote, the NTCA asked states with tiger reserves to “take action as appropriate” while settling the rights of forest-dwelling communities, and adhere to the provisions of “the Forest Rights Act in critical tiger habitats”.\n\nBut even in this letter, it added a caveat that clearly prioritised relocation over rights. It directed that “the voluntary village rehabilitation package . . . be explored a priori so as to benefit tribal communities by increasing their exposure to welfare and development schemes of the government”.\n\nAnother statute\n\nMany experts argue that the NTCA’s guidelines for relocation should no longer be treated as valid.\n\nDash said that the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, which was passed in 2013, “clearly supersedes” the NTCA’s relocation guidelines.\n\nHe explained that the LARR contains a special provision for those forest-dwelling families who stand to lose their rights under the FRA because their land is being acquired. It states that the category of “affected persons” under the law includes those “Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers who have lost any of their forest rights recognised” under the FRA “due to acquisition of land”.\n\nFurther, one section of the act has special protections for Scheduled Castes and Tribes, stating “as far as possible, no acquisition of land shall be made in Scheduled Areas” and that it should be done “only as a demonstrable last resort”.\n\nThe National Commission for Scheduled Tribes has also argued that “all proposals for village relocation should be prepared as per the provisions of the LARR Act”. It objected particularly to the compensation offered under the NTCA’s guidelines – in October 2018, it noted that it was of the “clear view” that the compensation package of Rs 15 lakh that the NTCA proposed was too low.\n\n“If followed in letter and spirit, the provisions of the LARR are definitely more likely to prevent forced displacement and provide better compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation outcomes,” said Kabra, currently associate researcher at New Delhi’s Centre de Sciences Humaines, in an interview with Scroll. “This requires a good social impact assessment study that takes into account various types of ecosystem services that local communities get from forests.”\n\nBut, as Kabra and Das noted in their paper, since the NTCA chose to take the “volition” route, they could “bypass” safeguards that LARR provided.\n\nOther researchers have also noted problems with NTCA’s voluntary relocation scheme. They found that many such instances of relocation under the NTCA’s scheme were not voluntary, and rather involved violence and coercion.\n\nIn a 2019 paper, researcher Eleonara Fanari documented 11 instances across India where communities were coerced to relocate or were dissatisfied with the terms of relocation by NTCA. This included in the Melghat tiger reserve in Maharashtra, where communities were coerced to sign papers for relocation, and Achanakmar in Chhattisgarh, where relocated villages did not receive proper rehabilitation as per the NTCA’s guidelines. Fanari also found in her field research that “when consent was taken, it was mostly under pressure or threat, or induced in other ways”, including “denial of access to basic health and education facilities, and schemes like MNREGA, children immunization programmes”.\n\nSuch forced and violent relocations continue to occur. In December 2024, 54 gram sabhas from Madhya Pradesh wrote to the tribal ministry stating that in various tiger reserves in the state, villages were being relocated in a “non-voluntary, unconstitutional, and forcible manner”. They also noted that the most recent process of relocation for Rani Durgawati, a new tiger reserves in the state, “was not in compliance with the LARR, 2013”.\n\nUnderperforming other duties\n\nThese conflicts have been exacerbated by recent moves by the NTCA to demarcate new tiger reserves in areas that many experts say do not meet the criteria to be deemed as such.\n\nSpecifically, in August 2023, the NTCA gave its approval in principle for tiger reserves in Rajasthan’s Kumbalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary and Karauli-Dholpur. But, experts noted, there has been no evidence of tigers in Kumbalgarh. Further, they argued that Kumbalgarh is not connected to any other tiger corridor in the region – that is, there is minimal possibility of tigers from other reserves wandering into Kumbalgarh.\n\n“On one hand they are creating tiger reserves where there are no tigers, and on the other hand, NTCA is not doing the work they should be doing according to their mandate,” said Debadityo Sinha, lead of the climate and ecosystems team at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy.\n\nFurther, he explained that the NTCA is neglecting some of its core functions, like ensuring that areas that link one tiger reserve to another or to another protected area are not used for any activity that is harmful to that ecology. “It is in these connecting forests and buffers that many hotels and guesthouses are coming up,” Sinha said. “The authority has also unnecessarily engaged itself in the introduction of African cheetah in India, which is not at all in its mandate.”\n\nChettri also argued that the NTCA was failing to fulfil some of its key functions under the Wildlife Protection Act, among them to “disallow any ecologically unsustainable land use such as mining, industry and other projects within the tiger reserves”.\n\nHe cited the example of the Ken-Betwa river linking project in the Panna tiger reserve as an instance in which the NTCA was not carrying out this responsibility. “Parts of the critical tiger habitat and buffer zone will be submerged,” he said.\n\nHe added that Panna was a significant case because of its history – in 2009, it became the second tiger reserve in India, after Sariska, to lose all its tigers. It took years of effort from the government and local communities to reintroduce and maintain a tiger population, making it one of the country’s most successful tiger conservation stories. Experts fear those gains may be squandered. “In 2021, the lease for the diamond mine by the state government to NMDC, which had expired on 31st December, 2020, was also extended,” Chettri added.\n\nAnother important function that the act designates to the NTCA is the approval of tiger conservation plans for states. This process has been slow – in 2016, the NTCA had not approved such plans for 16 tiger reserves in the country. More recently, the Supreme Court pulled up the Uttarakhand government for not having tiger conservation plans for the Rajaji and Corbett National Parks.\n\n“It may be the responsibility of the state government to prepare these plans, but the onus also falls on the NTCA to seek accountability,” said Chettri.\n\nIt is a grave enough problem that the NTCA has on many occasions violated people’s rights, Chettri said, “but by not carrying out its functions, NTCA is not working for the good for the wildlife either”.",

    "title": "‘Send millions of Indian peasants to Brazil to eradicate poverty and starvation’",
    "authors": ["Ajay Kamalakaran"],
    "raw_text": "In February 1974, Indian President VV Giri and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi received a letter from Kerala with an unexpected request: “promoting a mass emigration of Indian peasants” to Brazil.\n\nThe letter had been sent by Mathew Pallithanam, the organising secretary of the Indo-Brazilian Friendship Association in the coastal city of Alleppey. Along with the letter, the association attached a detailed plan titled “An Inter-Continental Exodus” that described the proposed mass migration to Brazil as a “must for eradication of human starvation and poverty”.\n\n“The sponsors of the proposal fervently hope that if it [the emigration] could be achieved, it would be an unprecedented step for the liberation of the suffering of millions of people in our country and for the welfare of all mankind,” Pallithanam wrote in the letter.\n\nBut why Brazil? “A vast country in the New World, nearly thrice larger than India in area and of surpassing natural facilities and potentialities, but only 1/7th of India in population has already stretched forth its hands to India for joint struggle for greater prosperity,” the proposal said.\n\nIt went on to add that Brazilian President Artur da Costa e Silva had discussed the idea with Indira Gandhi during her visit to the South American nation in 1968.\n\nDiplomatic relations\n\nNeither Pallithanam nor Costa e Silva was the first to suggest sending Indians to Brazil. As early as 1948, Mahatma Gandhi had spoken to lawyer and politician CP Ramaswamy Iyer about the prospect of resettling Partition refugees in the South American country – a conversation recorded by Iyer in Bhavan’s Journal, a publication of Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan, two decades later.\n\n“It was indeed after a most friendly interview with him less than a month before his assassination that I undertook, in [the] course of my travels, a journey to Brazil where Gandhiji had asked me to find out if there was any scope for settlement of the refugees from Pakistan,” Iyer wrote.\n\nWhile the authorities in Brazil might have supported the idea at the time, the possibility was ruled out because the diplomatic relations between the two countries were strained by the Brazilian support for the Portuguese position on Goa.\n\n“While Brazil tried to explain to India that its position was to be understood in the context of a long tradition of friendship between Brazil and Portugal, the Indian government was deeply disappointed that Brazil, a democratic country and a former colony, would support a non-democratic Portugal against democratic and recently independent India,” German-Brazilian political scientist Oliver Stuenkel wrote in the Indian Foreign Affairs Journal in 2010. “The episode complicated ties significantly, especially because the campaign to integrate Goa into Indian territory was immensely popular among the Indians.”\n\nDespite the uneasy diplomatic relations, Brazil’s doors seemed to remain open for Indians. “In 1958 the President of Brazil, in a message to Indian President Dr. Rajendra Prasad, officially invited Indian settlers to Brazil, assuring many facilities for migration and settlement,” the Indo-Brazilian Friendship Association said in its proposal. “At that time India had practically little trade with Brazil and the proposal had to be set aside for the lack of the foreign exchange needed for the purpose.”\n\nThings changed after the 1961 liberation of Goa. Diplomatic relations between India and Brazil began to gradually improve and there were several high-level exchanges, leading up to Indira Gandhi’s visit to the South American country in 1968.\n\nIn its proposal, the Indo-Brazilian Friendship Association cited several reasons why the migration idea deserved another look. It mentioned Brazil’s need for immigrants to tap into its vast natural resources and added that there was immense goodwill for India in the country.\n\n“With a traditionally inherent love for peace and very high educational attainments, Brazilians cherish the highest esteem for Gandhiji, Tagore and the people of India, and through their laws of emigration, provide immense promises for Indians to migrate to the country,” the letter said. “To cope with the immediate and far-reaching needs of India and mankind and in honourable acquittal of the avowed policies and programmes of joint efforts for a great and prosperous future, it has become a historic call for the Indian peasants today to migrate to Brazil.”\n\nThe association aimed big. It was not content with a small wave of migration and, instead, called for a million Indians to move to Brazil in the 1980s and another million in the 1990s. This included skilled and semi-skilled people, who could hardly be classified as “peasants”.\n\n“The government of Brazil would most willingly allot a few million acres of land in the fertile Amazon basin or elsewhere to our emigrants on fair price and long-term installment payments with due recognition of citizenship rights and privileges as well,” the association wrote. “Per unit of hundred families in the community of emigrants, there should be one doctor, five nurses, one engineer, five agro-industrial experts (graduates or above), five teachers, and enough artists, musicians etc. for organised social services and entertainment of the unit.”\n\nTo manage the vast migration process, the association proposed the formation of an international statutory body with a share capital of US$100 billion. “The governments of India and Brazil may contribute 40 per cent each of the share capital, and the UNO 20 per cent,” it said. “Within the framework, there may be due margin for the people of the respective countries also to subscribe to the share capital.”\n\nAnother job, the association proposed, the new statutory body could do is finance the production of consumer goods and industrial equipment. “Indian peasants, especially Keralites, possess the necessary agro-industrial skills and talents,” it said. “But certain psychological and economic factors necessitate a corporate venture by India, Brazil and the United Nations.”\n\nFinally, the association called on Catholic leaders in both countries to help Indian immigrants integrate into their new home. This was curious. There was nothing in the proposal to suggest it was meant only for Indian Catholics and the association clarified that the Catholic-majority South American country was officially secular and known for its religious tolerance.\n\nSecret report\n\nBoth the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Prime Minister’s Secretariat seriously considered the proposal from the Indo-Brazilian Friendship Association, but did not respond immediately. The director of the Prime Minister’s Secretariat forwarded the documents to the Ministry of External Affairs, which asked the Indian ambassador in Brasilia to study them in detail.\n\nA few weeks later, the Americas division of the Indian foreign ministry submitted a secret and highly critical report.\n\n“The question regarding the possibilities of emigration of Indians to Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina was taken up with the concerned governments through our missions since 1964,” the report said. “Though Paraguay and Argentina gave encouraging replies, the Brazilian government did not show any particular keenness in favour of Indians emigrating to Brazil.”\n\nThe Brazilian government definitely did not imagine the kind of migration numbers proposed by the Indo-Brazilian Friendship Association. Besides, the cost would have put it off, as it did the Indians.\n\nThe Indian foreign ministry’s report said the Cabinet Secretariat did not find the proposal feasible “mainly because of the huge involvement of foreign exchange”. Other reasons cited for the rejection were:\n\nThere is no scope for settling a sizable number of Indians due to distance and cost involved.\n\nAssisted emigration is unlikely to solve our population problem.\n\nFor much less cost, we could develop areas within India, which would relieve the pressure on congested areas.\n\nUntimely to consider such a scheme at a time when even those Indians settled abroad for a long time are facing situations which may force them to return to India.\n\nIn a handwritten response to the foreign ministry’s report, senior Indian diplomat Raj Krishna Tandon, who had served as ambassador to countries such as Ireland and the Netherlands, said “the semi-skilled or skilled immigrants, which the Brazilians most probably want, are the ones we can ill afford to lose... Besides, Brazil, most probably also wants foreign private investment, along with the skilled personnel. We can’t afford an outflow of capital in the foreseeable future.”\n\nThe ambitious proposal to send two million Indians to Brazil over two decades received a quick burial. Had it been implemented, one can only imagine the complications in the mass migration and its impact on India’s now-warm diplomatic relationship with Brazil.\n\nAjay Kamalakaran is a writer, primarily based in Mumbai.

    "authors": ["Scroll Staff"],
    "raw_text": "The Supreme Court on Friday rejected an application seeking permission to conduct an Urs at the site of the Pir Haji Shah Mangroli dargah in Gujarat’s Gir Somnath between February 1 and February 3, Live Law reported.\n\nThe dargah was among several Muslim religious sites and residences that were allegedly illegally demolished in Gir Somnath district in September.\n\nIn Islam, Urs is the death anniversary of a Sufi saint. It is typically conducted at the saint’s dargah, which is a shrine or tomb.\n\nA bench of Justices BR Gavai and AG Masih dismissed the request for conducting the Urs on the grounds that it could not be granted without hearing the “main matter”.\n\nThe bench was referring to a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against a Gujarat High Court order from October 3 that refused to stay the demolitions in Gir Somnath.\n\nOn September 28, the district authorities demolished nine mosques and shrines in addition to several homes in the Prabhas Patan area near the Somnath temple, allegedly on the pretext of removing encroachments from government land.\n\nSubsequently, a contempt petition was filed by the Summast Patni Muslim Jamat, which represents the Patni Muslim community in Prabhas Patan, claiming that the district authorities had illegally bulldozed the Muslim religious sites and residences.\n\nOn October 4, the Supreme Court refused to stay the demolition drive. It also sought a response to the contempt petition.\n\nDuring the hearing on the interlocutory application on Friday, Senior Advocate IH Syed, for the petitioner, said that the authorities had denied permission for the Urs after claiming that there was no dargah at the site.\n\nHowever, the dargah was an ancient protected monument and the Urs had been conducted at the site for several years, Syed added.\n\nIn response, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Gujarat government, told the bench that the structures allegedly encroaching on public land, including the temples, were demolished legally after following due process, Live Law reported.\n\nMehta claimed that there was no element of religious discrimination in the demolitions. He also claimed that there was no protected monument at the site, citing an affidavit filed by the Department of Archaeology in the case.\n\nNo religious activities, including Hindu rituals, were allowed on the land in question, the solicitor general added.\n\nThe interlocutory application, filed through the mujawar of the Pir Haji Mangroli Shah dargah, said that thousands of devotees visited the site every year during the Urs, Live Law reported. A mujawar is a caretaker or attendant of a Muslim shrine.\n\nThe application added that the authorities had always granted permission for the religious event in the past. Permission was sought this year as well from the police. However, the district collector issued a notification prohibiting the entry of persons onto the premises of the dargah, it said.",

    "raw_text": "Last updated Oct. 6, 2022\n\nWhat are the rules for commenting on Slate?\n\nYou can find the complete rules in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but here’s a quick summary, starting with some definite no-nos:\n\n• No hate speech, slurs, or offensive language.\n\n• No spam or advertising, including personal websites.\n\n• Don’t personally attack any person or group of people, including the writers, moderators, minorities, majorities, and members of political parties with which you disagree.\n\n• Linked, quoted, or sourced content must include context explaining why it’s relevant to the Slate article. Never post content you didn’t create without attribution.\n\n• Don’t repost a comment multiple times.\n\n• Don’t impersonate someone you’re not.\n\n• Don’t comment from multiple accounts.\n\nWhat if my opinion is considered hateful or offensive to others?\n\nSlate welcomes criticism, debate, and disagreement. We believe that, in order to have a healthy debate, people from all backgrounds must feel valued and welcome to contribute. This means, on rare occasions when a free airing of views comes into conflict with welcoming people from all backgrounds, we will prioritize welcoming people from traditionally marginalized groups. These groups do include people of color, people with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community, and do not include political parties or ideologies.\n\nOur moderators’ decisions are subjective. They are trying to improve the overall quality of the comment threads for all readers. They have to work quickly and efficiently. They have broad discretion to remove comments, and their decisions are final.\n\nIf you believe a moderator has deleted your comment in error, don’t debate their decision in the thread. Email commenting@slate.com with questions and concerns.\n\nOK, but can I swear?\n\nIn recognition of evolving social norms, Slate now allows commenters to use profanity, within reason, as long as the word does not double as a slur or attack on a group of people. Abuse of this leniency around profanity may result in removal of your comment, and personal attacks containing obscenities are grounds for a long suspension or permanent ban from commenting.\n\nAnything else?\n\nWe want the comments section to have value to all readers, and we don’t think readers want to wade through off-topic threads and lengthy monologues.\n\nTherefore, avoid the following:\n\n• Comments as long or longer than the article itself.\n\n• Going too far off topic.\n\n• Moving from your specific beef with an article to a general indictment of Slate or the media as a whole.\n\nWe will sometimes cut off a discussion that feels unproductive and close comments on a story. In doing so, we are exercising editorial judgment, much as print newspapers and magazines do when they choose which letters to publish in their Letters to the Editor sections.\n\nIn some cases, comments won’t appear on the site until a moderator can read and approve them. We often have a backlog of comments awaiting review, so please be patient with us. When clearing that queue, our moderators give priority to comments that make their point succinctly and clearly.\n\nCan you summarize that for me? TL;DR.\n\nMake your comments respectful, succinct, and relevant.\n\nYou deleted my comment! That’s censorship! Aren’t you violating my right to speech?\n\nIf you disagree with our decision not to publish your comment, we encourage you to publish it elsewhere. Twitter, Facebook, and other relatively open platforms make it easier than ever to express your views.\n\nThere are also other ways to send feedback to Slate:",

    "title": "How to Pitch Slate Magazine",
    "raw_text": "So you’d like to write for Slate—that’s great! If you haven’t worked with us before, here are a few pointers on how to craft a pitch and capture our attention. The best editors to contact for each section are listed at the bottom of this page.\n\nDo read Slate to get a sense of the magazine’s voice and examples of pieces that have been done in a similar vein.\n\nDo Google your idea. It may seem like a no-brainer, but often we reject a pitch because the writer’s argument doesn’t feel fresh or original. A brief search for other articles on your proposed subject can go a long way to figuring out what’s been written about it here or elsewhere, so you can avoid pitching something that feels familiar.\n\nDo make a strong argument if you are pitching opinion and analysis. Slate is known for surprising arguments. The best pitches are clear and concise with just enough detail. You don’t need to have answers to all the points your piece might raise, but we do like to know that you’ve done a bit of research to help formulate your pitch. We particularly appreciate ideas that don’t take conventional or partisan wisdom for granted or assume the audience shares their beliefs.\n\nDo pitch reported pieces and dispatches. Much of the above still applies. In these cases, also tell us what insights your reporting will help uncover or crystallize.\n\nDo distill your idea into a pitch, even if you have a full draft already written. If you happen to have a draft ready, feel free to attach it, but please make sure you still include a pitch describing the piece in the body of the email.\n\nDo include a bit about your background in the form of a one- to two-sentence bio. If you can, please provide any relevant published work that’s written in a voice similar to Slate’s. If not, writing from a personal blog or anywhere else is fine. We do not need a CV.\n\nDo let us know if you pitch your idea to multiple publications. As a general rule, if the story isn’t too timely, it’s ideal to wait about a week before sharing the pitch with another publication.\n\nAvoid more than one follow-up email. We try to respond to all pitches, but it often isn’t possible. If after a week or so you haven’t heard back, feel free to take it elsewhere.\n\nAvoid sending your pitch to another Slate editor if the first editor passes. We are in close and constant touch with each other and frequently the decision to pass is not made alone.\n\nTo give you a sense of the kind of pitches that will catch our eyes, here is one recently from a freelancer that became a Slate Culture story:\n\nI’m writing to pitch a piece that investigates why there are so many action stars with character names of Jack, John, or James.\n\nThis phenomenon has been briefly reported on before in the past but there is yet to be a deep-dive into the data behind it. I’ve created a spreadsheet that categorizes the last 70 years of action films and the names of the hero characters. Over a third of all action film stars in the 700 films I’ve collected start with the letter J. I’ve then been able to see how this trend has changed over time and how J names characters fair in comparison to box office success. I plan to contact various experts in the field of name studies to have a better understanding of why these particular names are so repetitively used by Hollywood writers and authors.\n\nI read Slate articles often and listen to the Culture Gabfest fairly religiously and think the slightly obsessive, detailed, and light-hearted tone would fit with Slate. My research reminded me of this recent article on why Taylor Swift holds her pen the way she does.\n\nI am a writer mostly focused on popular culture, data and technology. You can see my recently published book here.\n\nDo you think this story on J-named action stars would be a good fit with Slate?\n\nCulture\n\nForrest Wickman (movies, music, features)\n\nforrest.wickman@slate.com\n\nJenny G.

Its technology allows you to send encrypted messages or documents to Slate anonymously, though no system is 100 percent secure. Only a few Slate staffers have direct access to Slate’s SecureDrop server, which is under the physical control of Slate.\n\nPlease note that when you submit certain types of files through SecureDrop, you may be sending us metadata associated with that file. Additionally, the content of the messages you send and receive through SecureDrop may include personally identifiable information.\n\nSince the system uses the Tor browser instead of conventional browsers (like Chrome or Safari), it takes a few extra steps to set up. When using SecureDrop, you’ll want to use devices you own on public Wi-Fi—not home or work networks.\n\nHere’s how you do it:\n\n1. Download and install the Tor browser, which uses an anonymous network to route your data.\n\n2. Launch the browser.\n\n3. Paste Slate’s SecureDrop address into Tor: http://vrsmpjemjfcaimqd.onion. Make sure not to paste this URL into a regular browser.\n\n4. Follow the instructions on the page to send messages or documents.\n\n5. After you hit submit, you’ll receive a code name that will let you return to send more information or view any messages we sent you. Remember your code name; we do not have access to it.\n\nSlate makes no warranties as to SecureDrop. Use of the system is on an “as is” basis. Use it at your own risk.",

    "title": "Donald Trump’s executive orders since his inauguration have been exactly as promised.",
    "authors": ["Jim Newell"],
    "raw_text": "You can’t be surprised. Donald Trump’s first week in office has been exactly as promised, with dramatic action every 15 minutes. This, for him, is where policy and public relations align: Not only does he stay busy making changes he campaigned on, but the haste with which he moves makes it difficult for critics to focus on any one particular thing. If there was one move that broke through the noise this week and had staying power, it was his full pardon of nearly all those convicted of crimes on Jan. 6. A blanket pardon of this sweep was not, in fact, a clear campaign promise; he’d always demurred on how far he would go. It stood out among the other orders because there really is not a public-interest argument for freeing hundreds of violent criminals acting to stop the peaceful transfer of power. Elsewhere, Trump’s early (meaningful) actions have emphasized immigration crackdowns (including on refugees who’d already made plans to travel to the United States), ceasing DEI initiatives within the government, and harassment of former critics. He’s already issued one executive order that’s been blocked in federal court for being “blatantly unconstitutional.” Trump will continue moving at this pace until there’s any indication that it comes at a price. And so far, Democrats have not yet found the spark for a second resistance.\n\nWe could dedicate an entire separate Surge to Elon Musk each week. (Editors—don’t read that.) On Monday, he was practically sitting on Trump’s lap during the inauguration, then traveled to the Capital One Arena to warm up the overflow crowd ahead of Trump’s appearance. There, Musk made a gesture that looked an awful lot like a Nazi salute, commanding days’ worth of the internet’s attention. Our belief, especially as he said “My heart goes out to you,” is that this was an instance of him being unusually awkward and not knowing how his body works—though Nazis online certainly appreciated the gesture. Elsewhere, we learned that Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which previously existed as more of a concept, will be an actual office housed within the government. He’ll have government office space and a government email address. Usually this would mean that the guy with a billion businesses that contract with the government would have to divest his interests, but there are no longer rules in America. Oh, and Musk also eliminated Vivek Ramaswamy (more on that later). Perhaps the most interesting Musk news, though, was that, one day after Trump held a big press conference with other tech nerds to unveil a pricey new A.I. infrastructure project, Musk started trashing it, perhaps related to his ongoing feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. We know that Musk is relatively new to the Trump inner circle, but his stay may be short if he keeps contradicting the boss like this.\n\nLost in the discussion about Pete Hegseth’s behavior at the Fox & Friends holiday party or Tulsi Gabbard’s meeting with Bashar al-Assad has been a necessary spotlight on Russell Vought, Trump’s nominee to serve (for a second time) as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Unlike with Hegseth or Gabbard, there’s no question that Vought is qualified and knows what he’s doing. And that’s what makes him so concerning to Democrats. Vought is arguably the leading intellect on the right behind Trump’s plan to gut civil service protections. The first couple of pages of his chapter on the presidency in Project 2025, of which he was a major architect, are key reading in this regard. What’s been of particular concern to senators in his two confirmation hearings—the second of which came this week—is his support for impoundment powers, in which the White House sits on money duly appropriated by Congress. Impoundment is against the law—indeed, the OMB violated this law on occasion in Trump’s first term—but Trump has argued that the law is unconstitutional. In his hearing this week, Vought backed that up, saying he agreed with Trump’s assessment. The Surge would like you to imagine a world in which Congress reaches a government funding deal, or an emergency spending deal, and after it's signed into law, Trump decides who’s actually going to get any of that money. Because this hypothetical will come before the federal judiciary soon enough.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk had a dream: to change the world through DOGE, an amorphous entity to remake the federal government, and a backronym of an internet joke. But Ramaswamy didn’t even make it to Inauguration Day, and DOGE’s purview appears to have been tailored. After hashing it out for a few weeks, Musk’s and Ramaswamy’s visions clashed—and it was always clear who the senior member of this partnership was (the one with more money). While Ramaswamy got caught up in visions of deregulation and dismantling the administrative state, that’s Russell Vought’s turf. Instead, DOGE, as established by a Day 1 executive order, will serve as a rebranded United States Digital Service and will look more like the Geek Squad, sending DOGE teams to governmental agencies to improve their technology and efficiency. (Ramaswamy, it’s also worth mentioning, had gotten in trouble with the Trumpies for posting over the holidays that too many Americans were stupid idiots.) What’s a lad to do when his Washington ambitions have all come crashing down? Run for governor of Ohio! Hey, now. A gig’s a gig.\n\nCongratulations to America: Pete Hegseth will be your new secretary of defense. Have we decided yet who’s bringing the kegs to the Pentagon courtyard? The final march toward Hegseth’s Friday confirmation did involve a hair of drama, as Hegseth’s former sister-in-law submitted an affidavit to the Senate that Hegseth’s second wife, Samantha, “hid in a closet once from Hegseth” and “that she developed escape plans for use ‘if she felt she needed to get away from Hegseth’ that would be activated with a code word and that she did once put the escape plans into action,” as NBC News reported. Samantha Hegseth, when asked for comment, told NBC News that “there was no physical abuse in my marriage.” This was enough for the right to dismiss the story as a hit job, and Hegseth survived by the skin of his teeth. Vice President J.D. Vance cast the tiebreaking vote after Sens. Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined all Democrats to vote against Hegseth. We’re not sure there’s been a better indicator of Trump’s strength within the Republican Party than this guy getting confirmed by the Senate.\n\nLast week, with Washington in full panic about having to enforce a law it overwhelmingly passed last year that would’ve banned ByteDance-owned teen-hypnosis app TikTok on Jan. 19, we guessed that Trump might have triggered the law’s 90-day extension clause—even though ByteDance had not met any of the criteria the law spelled out for a 90-day extension. We were wrong. Instead, Trump’s executive action on the matter instructed the Justice Department not to enforce the law for 75 days. That’s not exactly the way things are supposed to work, but with Democrats scared of TikTok users and Republicans scared of Trump, who’s going to push back? As for Trump’s plans for TikTok—oh, does he have plans. He’s floated a deal in which the government gets a 50 percent stake in the platform. A U.S. government–owned app would be so fire. And he says he’d pressure ByteDance to sell by threatening overwhelming tariffs against China if it didn’t. Yada, yada, yada. As for why Trump has changed his mind over the need for a TikTok ban, he told reporters Monday: “I got to use it. And remember, TikTok is largely about kids, young kids. If China is going to get information about young kids out of it, to be honest, I think we have bigger problems than that.” That, and he got close with a billionaire who owns 15 percent of ByteDance.\n\nAdministrations may change, but horny congressmen making bad decisions are a fact of life. Despite House Speaker Mike Johnson saying that he would look forward, not backward, when asked about Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons, he also said that he’d reconstitute a select subcommittee to investigate the doings of the Democrat-led Jan. 6 committee from a couple of years ago. The new subcommittee’s chair, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, led a similar probe in the previous Congress. This week, the Washington Post reported that last June, an aide to Johnson had warned the investigators against subpoenaing Cassidy Hutchinson—a key witness for the Jan. 6 committee—“in an effort to prevent the release of sexually explicit texts that lawmakers sent her.” According to the Post, “Multiple colleagues had raised concerns with the speaker’s office about the potential for public disclosure of ‘sexual texts from members who were trying to engage in sexual favors’ with Hutchinson.” A first thought here is that Hutchinson has been well advised to hang on to those texts as leverage. The vampires are coming, and she’s holding some stinky, stinky garlic. A second thought is that it can’t be emphasized enough how stupid some members of Congress are.",

    "title": "News today: I'm afraid to read the news again. Maybe that's actually a good thing.",
    "authors": ["David Mack"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAt night, I hear the terrors calling. Their foreboding drumbeat grows louder, and when the sun finally rises, my fear is at its peak. This is when I must finally confront the monsters that haunt me: Yes, it’s time to check the news alerts on my phone.\n\nSince Donald Trump’s reelection, and especially since his inauguration this week, I have become reacquainted with a phenomenon I had not experienced in years: I’m afraid to check the news. There is a very real, physical sense of dread I feel each time my phone flashes with some new push notification. Each alert elicits a Pavlovian response in which my heart sinks and I wonder, What now? And then I remember we’re not even one week into this thing.\n\nIt all feels exhausting. Then I tell myself it’s designed to be exhausting, and I feel guilt. And then my guilt makes me question whether I’m doing “enough,” and I feel fear. And then the fear starts to feel exhausting, and I am back at the beginning. As you can tell, I’m doing great!\n\nThis is particularly ironic for me because for almost a decade, including through the entirety of the first Trump administration, I worked in breaking news as an editor and reporter at BuzzFeed News (RIP). The day after Trump won the 2016 election, our editor in chief assembled his troops and delivered an inspiring call to arms in which he told us that people across the country were scared and we needed to get working on the biggest story of our lifetimes. From there, the pace never relented. Trump bled into every corner of the news. It didn’t matter if you were writing a story about sports or Hollywood or ballet, there was surely a Trump angle lurking. The only other times I experienced this working in media was when the #MeToo movement and the pandemic got underway, both of which eventually sparked fatigue and their own backlash.\n\nIn truth, it was also addictive. For years, like some sort of sick masochist, I even had my phone set up so Trump’s tweets would push directly to my screen and I could keep abreast with whatever new development he’d announced at 2 a.m. I was actually asleep when news broke in the middle of the night that he had COVID and I never forgave myself for missing it.\n\nPeople were reading it, too. Traffic and viewership soared for news outlets everywhere, as did subscriptions. Audiences were hungry to learn what the next chaotic development would be in the Trump Show. “It’s a very exciting time—and that’s a diplomatic word for terrifying,” Marc Maron told Jimmy Fallon just six months into that first term. “You go to bed at night and you’re like, Is this it? Is this the last night? What’s going to get us? Is it gonna be the nuke? Is it going to be global warming? Is the president going to start a civil war? What’s happening?!”\n\nAs former Slate executive editor Allison Benedikt wrote in a 2017 project about the push alerts that took over our lives that year, all this news fundamentally altered our collective psyche. “We’ve all been checking our phones and waiting for the next big thing,” she wrote. “We didn’t always wake up expecting news. The cadence of life has changed.”\n\nThis time around feels different though. We’ve had time to live outside of Trump’s main character energy for a little bit, to detox, only to find ourselves back here again. And not just “here” but possibly somewhere even worse: He’s got more support this time, having (barely) clinched the popular vote, which has created a sense of shock that we don’t quite know what to do with. After 2016, so many people became activated in ways they never had before, but where did that get us? This time, we’ve become withdrawn instead of engaged. Exhausted, disgusted, or defeated, many Americans are choosing to disconnect from news as much as possible or simply altogether (something that used to be so unusual that in 2018 the New York Times profiled a man who made the once curious decision to block out all news from his life). The anxious questions Maron said kept him up at night haven’t disappeared, but we’re no longer sure what to do about them.\n\nTo be clear, I make no judgment here. For months now in my New York City and social media bubbles, the dominant attitude has been to delude ourselves that this isn’t really happening. Every time I read aloud some headline about a Cabinet appointment to my partner, he would practically get up and leave the room. “How can you watch that?” he asked me when I tuned in to the inauguration on Monday, having decided that I probably couldn’t shut this out any longer, before regretting my decision almost immediately.\n\nTeam Trump has made no secret of their strategy to flood the zone—with appointees, with executive orders, with scandal. And this constant wave of news seemingly designed in a lab to trigger the libs, or anyone with a commitment to truth and decency, can lead to stress and burnout, according to psychologists (and most likely our own analysis of ourselves from 2017–2020). News fatigue is real, but each one of those alerts and headlines speaks to something very real that’s happening. These things will require a response, even if it doesn’t look like the “Resistance” of old.\n\nIn fact, maybe it’s time to admit that it’s better if it doesn’t, because that evidently failed. Nonstop outrage is also exhausting and only fuels the reactionary conservative forces that got us here. We need to find a new way to live under Trump, and that starts with a new way of engaging with him. This time, let’s not let him be the loudest person in our lives.\n\nIf many outlets have changed how they cover Trump, then much of their audience is changing how they consume this news, too. This time around, we need not strap ourselves in, eyes glued eternally open like we’re in A Clockwork Orange. We can know that there is a difference between staying informed and staying eternally outraged. Allow yourself the grace of not losing your mind, because dark forces are hoping that you do. In a democracy, ignorance is never the right answer, but long-term resistance requires sustained energy and a clear mind. It’s OK—healthy, even—to be selective about how much news you’re consuming or when you’re consuming it. It’s much too early to say what are the most effective ways to hold this administration to account, but with time and clear minds we can figure it out.\n\nPersonally, I’m going to try to turn off or silence phone notifications, or at least limit them. Instead of listening to cable-TV pundits or YouTube commentators or podcast hosts, I’m going to try to listen to people in my local community. How are they coping? What are they afraid of? What do they need from me at this moment?\n\nAll this will be easier for some people and harder for others, depending on the level of threat you may face from this administration. But I’m not proposing that you look away. I’m suggesting that in order to survive, even thrive, through these next few years, look to yourself, to who you are when not defined or consumed by him. Don’t let anyone, especially not the president, set the terms for what makes your life truly worth living.\n\nFacing a terminal cancer diagnosis, the fantasy writer Mishell Baker shared advice this week in a viral thread on Bluesky on how to live—to truly live—with a condition that can often overwhelm you with dismay. Don’t let eventual horrors beyond your control distract you from the opportunities you have to create something lovely right now, she urged. “There is no calamity so huge that there is not beauty and humor and joy to be had in the moments between actively working on solving or evading it,” Baker wrote.\n\nThe night Trump won last year, I called my mother in Australia. She was upset and disgusted at the result—so much so that she was considering canceling a trip to come see me in New York for Thanksgiving. I told her I didn’t blame her. But then gradually over the weeks that followed, we decided to not let his victory ruin a reunion we had each been looking forward to. We had both reached the same conclusion that I share with you now: Give him your attention. Don’t give him your life. Right now, that may be the most powerful act of resistance you have.",

    "title": "Google Quietly Installed A.I. to My Workspace. Getting Rid of It Was Creepy.",
    "authors": ["Shasha Léonard"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nLast Tuesday, I returned from a blissfully computerless vacation abroad and logged back into work, only to find an uninvited visitor in my inbox: Gemini, Google’s A.I. assistant, had been deployed to my workspace without any warning. When I logged into Gmail for the first time in two weeks, a side panel popped out, introducing itself like the ghost of Clippy past. “Hi Shasha, how can I help you today?” it asked, along with offers of a few options like summarizing conversations, drafting an email, and showing me unread emails—the latter of which would have been immediately possible had that pop-up not been in my way to begin with.\n\nA.I. is controversial, and for good reason. Generative tools such as the large language model ChatGPT, or image generators like Midjourney, simultaneously threaten livelihoods and spread harmful misinformation. That’s not to mention the enormous environmental impact these resource-draining systems have. There is no doubt A.I. is here to stay, but the question is in what capacity and for whose benefit. And while there is no blanket answer, ethically speaking, it should always involve personal consent, especially when that consent is being presumed by a billion-dollar company.\n\nSo I headed to my user settings to turn Gemini off. But if you also use Google for work and have tried to do the same, you’ll have also noticed it’s not possible. Now, this is where most people’s struggle would end, at a loss for choice, and with maybe an annoyed email to their IT guy.\n\nBut I happen to be Slate’s annoyed IT guy—so I logged into my admin panel, located the brand-new “Generative AI” tab, and navigated to the object of my concern: “Gemini for Google Workspace” … only to find there were no settings to manage whatsoever, nor any option to turn it off.\n\nThis is particularly baffling, given that most—if not all—of Workspace’s features are customizable through the admin panel. That’s literally what we pay Google for.\n\nFor example, if I want to manage Drive external/internal viewing settings for certain users, I can do that. If I want to limit a user’s sharing abilities in Calendar, I can do that. If, for whatever reason, I want to turn those features off entirely despite being major components of a user’s workflow, I can do that. Why would Gemini be any different?\n\nSecond-guessing myself, I turned off the Gemini App instead and hoped for the desired changes to take effect (which Google warns you can take some time). But a few days passed with Gemini still asking me if I needed help finishing my sentences in Gmail, so like any other irritated and long-standing denizen of the internet, I headed over to Reddit to see what other sysadmins had to say about this. What I found unsettled me.\n\nIn one post, Reddit user heretocomplain123 described how they had also encountered Gemini for Google Workspace, but couldn’t immediately turn it off. Eventually, they were able to find the solution after contacting a Google rep. “I chatted with customer support, and at my request they ADDED the settings, after which I was able to toggle off all Gemini for Workspace settings (gmail, etc.),” the user wrote.\n\nYou had to go ask Google for the ability to turn it off.\n\nThanks to the screenshots OP attached, many of us were able to follow suit, some waiting a few hours in the customer support queue, some waiting several days for Gemini to finally go away. I waited 10 minutes. Here are screenshots from my own chat with Google Workspace Support.\n\nAccording to what I just experienced, and what many other paid users are experiencing, Google has made opting in to generative A.I. the default. You have to go the extra mile and wait, sometimes hours, in the support queue to even have the option to opt out. Just as Meta’s search bar doubles as an A.I. search, or how the Transportation Security Administration rolled out default biometric screening at airports, these are forms of a manipulative design strategy to all but force you to engage with and train A.I. (It is also an excellent example of enshittification.)\n\nWhile the ethics of consent are the most immediate here, it’s also critical to acknowledge generative A.I.’s well-documented environmental impact, as well as its growing role in modern warfare, like Meta opening its A.I. model to the U.S. military, further harming the environment. The push to normalize the technology’s usage, often without user input, raises urgent questions about accountability and sustainability.\n\nGoogle Support chat assured myself and others in the subreddit that the option to opt out of Gemini for Google Workspace would be rolled out for everyone … eventually. But the issue at hand is that Gemini for Google Workspace was rolled out as a finished product without the ability to opt out or manage its settings. The issue isn’t just about Gemini’s intrusiveness—it’s about the erosion of user autonomy. By making A.I. opt-out rather than opt-in, Google is setting a dangerous precedent: the presumption of consent by default.\n\nUtpal Dholakia describes this default in an article for Psychology Today as a technique used by anyone “interested in influencing others’ behavior,” as well as representing an asymmetrical power dynamic. “The manipulator is powerful, and the manipulated is weak,” he wrote. Governments and businesses use behavioral nudges to influence citizens and employees—not the other way around. “If I tried to nudge the U.S. government to lower my tax bill, an outcome that I might, no doubt, consider to be virtuous and acceptable, I would very quickly find myself in prison.”\n\nDefault opt-ins create a massive power imbalance—one that could “produce tremendous and irreversible harm to a great many people,” he adds.\n\nIn a recent interview, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, one of the largest and most influential A.I. companies in the U.S., stated that “the entire structure of society will be up for debate and reconfiguration” as A.I. continues to evolve. If this is the case, then this social contract for how we use—or are made to use—A.I. is actively being negotiated in instances like Google pushing Gemini on our workspaces.\n\nIt is unethical that I had to reach out to Google Support to ask for the option to turn off Gemini for my workspace, because all users should have the option to opt in or out, if they so choose. Using our right to say no where we can, as annoying or futile as it may seem, is crucial, as it shapes the future of an already skewed power dynamic where saying no might not be possible anymore.\n\nSome might argue that this approach is necessary to ensure widespread adoption and improve the tool through user feedback. Because A.I. models rely on data to evolve, making Gemini a default feature guarantees engagement. While this reasoning may seem valid, it ignores the ethics of consent. Presuming consent by default undermines trust and sets a dangerous precedent for how tech companies interact with users.\n\nWhile data on A.I. usage suggests massive popular interest, it’s hard to take those numbers at face value in cases where users are automatically opted in to the experience. Just because we all woke up with U2’s Songs of Innocence on our iPhones doesn’t make it the most popular album of all time. This unreliable and inflated data then fuels a vicious cycle: Big tech companies double down on A.I., deploy products like Gemini for Workspace that users can’t opt out of, and then expect immediate returns for their shareholders—while waiting for users to embrace it enthusiastically.\n\nGemini for Workspace is now disabled for everyone at Slate until Google offers users the option to opt in themselves. As A.I. becomes more commonplace in our digital lives, especially when there is so little legislation to prevent its misuse, we must demand accountability and the right to say no. Opting out should never be a premium feature—it’s a basic right.\n\nNote: No A.I. assistance was used in the writing of this article.",

    "authors": ["Nitish Pahwa"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOn Monday, Elon Musk spoke at a televised inauguration rally and threw a Nazi-style salute to the adoring crowd not once but twice. Brushing off the widespread outrage with the help of his sycophants, he has declined to clarify just what he meant by that gesture. Meanwhile, German officials and journalists, Jewish American activists, and white supremacists have all agreed that, whatever the intent, the salute was a meaningful callback to one of the darkest chapters of modern history.\n\nStill, the all-powerful Musk continues to evade accountability, while those who publicly denounce the gesture—including a Milwaukee meteorologist who got fired for criticizing the Tesla CEO on her personal Instagram account—may fear retribution. Thus, the activism turns to anonymous online spaces, as members of one of the internet’s largest networks band together to call Musk out.\n\n#Resistance, thy name is Reddit.\n\nOn Tuesday, members of major sports-centered subreddits, like r/hockey, started asking their moderators whether they would consider banning users from sharing links to Elon Musk’s X, the Nazi-infested social platform formerly known as Twitter. The momentum took off across hundreds of other subreddits, their respective posts citing the myriad Redditors who’d been discussing bans. Many of these spaces, including the fan communities for It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, the Real Housewives, Transformers, and the tabletop game Warhammer, don’t tend to be openly political. Nevertheless, they’ve chosen to bar X links and stand by the decision.\n\nSome mods are acting unilaterally; others have been thinking through all the implications of such a blackout; still others have put the matter up to community polling. The overseers of the popular Formula 1 subreddit are doing a trial run, “with the intention to make this ban permanent,” in which all X links and screenshots will be forbidden “with the only exception of screenshots of relevant posts by teams, drivers & F1 that are not available on any other platform.” Although the initial burst of momentum has slowed, various Redditors are still deliberating and deciding on the question, with r/ChicagoSuburbs finalizing its ban on X, Facebook, and Instagram links (though not screenshots) on Friday afternoon.\n\nOthers are also going beyond X links. The r/StLouis subreddit deliberated on whether to similarly ban TikTok videos. The feminist and pro-transgender “X Chromosomes” communities are banning links to X and to Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, citing the newly relaxed hate-speech standards announced by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The NBA subreddit confirmed Wednesday that it would do the same and, as with the World of Warcraft subreddit, go so far as to block even screenshots of X posts. The notorious r/antiwork space barred all those sites, along with any videos from the Chinese-owned apps TikTok and RedNote.\n\nStill, just as Reddit wasn’t unanimous in determining the extent of these bans, its moderators didn’t universally decide to ax X links. R/Seattle is going to do so, but r/SeattleWA isn’t, with moderator u/AllThisIsGoodForYou stating that “you are all capable of choosing to click or not click on something” and that “if you find this position to be intolerable then you can just not participate here.” (Another mod followed up with a poll asking if dissenting users would be selling their Teslas in protest.) A moderator for the Red Sox subreddit posted on X about their controversial decision to “refuse to ban X links,” explaining that “regardless of what your feelings on Elon or this site are, tons of primary sources for sports reporting” are available only on X. They repeated the r/SeattleWA justification that “people who don’t like X can just not click the links,” but they also went on to decry the protesting Redditors, writing, “This is a vocal minority of people coordinating a movement to get X banned on as many subs as possible. It’s activism, not organic.” (A poll of community members later found that the majority of voters supported an X-links ban.)\n\nModerator u/JonathanDHalvorson lodged a similar allegation in r/OptimistsUnite, referring to the outrage as “an organized political censorship campaign” for which “it appears bot accounts are being used.” Unlike the other dissenting mods, Halvorson defended Musk himself, claiming that “there is no chance this was intended as a Nazi salute” and chalking the gesture up to the Tesla CEO’s “being an enthusiastic spaz.” Some commenters supported the decision while objecting to Halvorson’s excuses for the salute. Another pointed out that Halvorson owns a Tesla.\n\nI reached out to one user who responded to Halvorson with disappointment over the salute defense—though not necessarily the stance against link bans—and agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. “I’m just sick of people pretending that obvious things aren’t obvious,” they wrote to me over the site’s chat function. “Musk has been radicalizing in real time before our eyes and getting more and more far right each month. … I have to believe that the truth still matters and there are people who will understand once the facts are laid out before them.”\n\nThis r/OptimistsUnite community member, who has been on Reddit for more than a decade, pointed to a few reasons why the site is one of the last social networks amenable to protests of this nature. “Reddit as a whole is pissed at mainstream media capitulation to Trump and the excuse-making,” they wrote. “There are right-wing pockets that love it but Reddit tends to skew techy, liberal to libertarian, and educated. All of those demographics revolt at the idea of sanewashing Trump and his major boosters like Musk.”\n\nIndeed, users from staunchly right-wing spaces on Reddit, like r/conservative, are complaining that the anti-X campaigning is “spamming” the site with “leftist propaganda,” calling for Reddit’s corporate higher-ups to “take back control of the website.” However, Reddit’s leadership seems content to let things stand: A spokesperson told USA Today that “Users can and are able to modify or issue their own rules within their respective forums.”\n\nHow are those rulemakers faring? I spoke with two longtime members of the r/NBA moderation team (who also preferred to remain anonymous) about their wide-ranging decision to block X and Meta from the subreddit. They’ve had ample experience with Reddit protests: In 2020 they teamed up with the team overseeing r/AskHistorians to implement a blackout in protest of George Floyd’s murder as well as hate speech on the platform. They also joined in the 2023 blackouts against Reddit’s decision to charge third-party systems for access to Reddit’s API. In both instances, they said, moderators earned more decisionmaking power as well as guidance and tools—in other words, they know that protests can work.\n\nBut did they think this round would also lead to substantive changes and healthier communities? They were a little skeptical of that. “Since Elon took over Twitter, we’ve seen a number of changes on that platform,” they noted, citing the inability to view posts and replies without logging in, blocked access to Twitter’s API, and issues with spam and fake news. “All of these were issues that have come up in the community over the past couple of years”—not a small thing, considering how central NBA Twitter once was to keeping abreast of league news and games. “We heard complaints in terms of visibility when tweets were linked—people couldn’t see replies and stuff if they weren’t logged in. The Meta platforms had the same issue: With Threads, you have to log in.”\n\nIt was the overarching concern over user friendliness that, for the moderators, even trumped the inciting event. “None of us are endorsing Nazi symbolism, and if it were just based on that, it would have been cut-and-dry,” they explained. “We know that a lot of other subs will follow if we do something, so we have to make decisions carefully, and what we were hearing most from our users was the lack of accessibility with the new Twitter.”\n\nAccessibility issues were also mentioned as the reason subreddits for the video game Baldur’s Gate 3, the anime One Piece, and the state of Georgia have banned X links. Many other moderators have, likewise, cited an overall plunge in Reddit posts/comments linking to X content ever since Musk’s takeover. “We did consider [a ban] but discovered we only had 8 posts from Twitter in 2024, and a whopping 12 posts in 2023,” wrote a r/Lego moderator. “We get so little traffic from Twitter.” An r/Utah moderator similarly noted, “Very few people submit X.com links … to begin with.” The site formerly known as Twitter was no longer driving these conversations, and it was hardly practical to pretend like it still could. For r/Lego, it was so middling that a ban would seem pointless.\n\nFor many communities, the reasons also extend to the harmful and dangerous content on X. The r/Georgia subreddit cited the reinstatement of “accounts involved with posting” child sexual abuse material. R/Atlanta had already been removing X links over the past year “due to the rampant abuse and impersonation taking place on that platform,” which made it impossible to “verify that a post is legitimate,” according to moderator u/SDrawHCab.\n\nThe trends are clear: For Reddit, X/Twitter had been dying for a long time, and Elon Musk’s latest move is merely hastening its demise. As other institutions increasingly back away from X, they may find that the platform has long been withering away all on its own. X was run incompetently and shedding users long before Elon made that little salute—and that move just served to clarify why that is. Now various major subreddits, with total followers numbering in the tens of millions, are making it plain that they don’t even want to see stuff from X anymore. Seems clear Musk did not see that coming.",

    "authors": ["Joan Bregstein"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nMy daughter recently called to tell me her otherwise healthy 7-month-old son, Sid—my first grandson—had a fever of 105. His normally peaches-and-cream complexion was gray, and his hair (to the extent that he has it) was matted down with sweat. My daughter and I are both pediatricians, so of course Sid is vaccinated. We felt comfortable assuming it was “just a virus” and would resolve uneventfully with Tylenol and fluids.\n\nBut with decreasing vaccination rates, resistance to vaccines on the rise, and a Health and Human Services confirmation hearing for an apparent anti-vaxxer occurring on Jan. 29, I wonder how many parents and grandparents will continue to have that assurance.\n\nI have worked in pediatric emergency departments for the past 35 years—since before the innovative conjugate vaccines against streptococcal pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza type B were licensed in the ’80s and ’90s and introduced into the early-childhood vaccine schedule. Before these vaccines, the incidence of bacterial disease—bacteremia, meningitis, and death—was high. We had to depend on evidence-based testing parameters (blood, urine, and spinal fluid) to determine a sick child’s risk for developing life-threatening disease. Otherwise, we couldn’t tell whose illness was something benign and viral, and would resolve uneventfully, and whose was bacterial and might end very differently. With these vaccinations, the risk to young children of developing a dangerous illness was so dramatically reduced that extensive testing was no longer needed. And for those who could not be vaccinated—because they were too young, had a preexisting condition preventing vaccination, or couldn’t mount an immune response—they were protected by herd immunity.\n\nIf Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is confirmed, and if vaccine mandates are removed, and parents are given permission to opt out for their children, vaccine rates could drop to 50 percent, if the number of people who get the influenza vaccine is any guide. When sick, Sid, or any infant, will likely not be able to sit at home, sweating it out.\n\nThis is how it was when I first started my career; I remember it vividly, and don’t want to see it again.\n\nSid would be in the emergency department, dressed in a gown. Screaming, he would be held down by medical staff, one at each flailing appendage and a fifth faceplanted across his torso. A tourniquet would be tied around his arm or leg and the search for a vein would begin. Most in a young child are invisible (unlike adult veins that protrude like overflowing estuaries), but are occasionally palpable beneath the skin as linear squishy balloons. A tiny needle would be inserted blindly into the spot above that squishy place—that hopefully had not rolled away by then—and with any luck, a stream of garnet-colored liquid would emerge. With Sid still squirming, the blood would traverse the attached tubing, landing in the syringe at the end. Unintended needle sticks were always a possibility, made worse since none of us wore gloves.\n\nThe next procedure would be urine collection. The area below the belly button and above the pubic bone would be swabbed with a cold, brown, sterile cleaning solution, and a 2-to-3-inch-long needle inserted perpendicular to the skin directly into the abdomen, aimed at the bladder. The plunger of the syringe attached to the needle would be pulled back and, hopefully, urine quickly accumulated. If not, the procedure would be repeated in a different area. Or, with concern that he could be dehydrated, an intravenous catheter would be inserted in whatever vein could be found and IV fluids dripped in for a period of time, at which point the procedure would be attempted again.\n\nAlternatively, a plastic catheter, with a diameter equal to the size of a strand of spaghetti, would be inserted into and threaded up his tiny, wildly moving urethra while he was held sprawled on the stretcher like an outstretched frog, continuing to scream.\n\nAt this point he may have progressed to a breath-holding spell, as prolonged screaming often does in infancy, with blue lips and no air movement. The sterile procedure would need to be temporarily halted while a nasal cannula with nasal prongs was placed in both nostrils and the delivery of oxygen was begun. At this point, the urine extraction procedure would be restarted from the beginning with the cold, brown, sterile cleaning solution.\n\nIf he looked ill enough, a spinal tap would be performed, during which he would be curled into a ball like a fetus. A 1 ½–inch needle would be inserted perpendicularly into his back, carefully navigating between his small vertebrae, and then delicately plunged into the spinal cord—with a diameter the size of a piece of bucatini pasta—without going even a millimeter too far. (If it went too far, the needle would exit the far side of the space around the cord, causing fluid to leak out. In older patients, this would cause what is known as a post–lumbar puncture headache. In infants, what we know for sure is that it would necessitate the recommencement of the procedure.)\n\nSid would then receive an antibiotic injection to protect him against the possibility of bacteria in the blood, as it would take 24 to 48 hours to really know for sure what he was up against. For kids who are lucky, it really will be “just a virus.” But it could end up being much scarier—and even fatal.\n\nThis ordeal at the emergency department would not be an infrequent occurrence; fever in young children is common, affecting millions of infants and young toddlers annually. Young, vaccinated children like Sid are protected against many of the diseases that killed our ancestors: pneumococcal pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae type-B meningitis, pertussis whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria, and hepatitis B, as well as rotavirus, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2. And children older than him are also shielded from the fatal lung and brain disease caused by measles; the deafness, encephalitis, and testicular atrophy caused by mumps; and the birth defects and stillbirths caused by rubella in pregnant women.\n\nBut this will change if vaccine mandates are lifted. “It is likely these diseases will return,” remarks Peter Dayan, who is a pediatric emergency department attending at a major children’s hospital and a colleague of mine. “This will mean medicine will step back in time and revert to subjecting young children to painful procedures that we had been able to nearly eliminate for the last decades.”\n\nTo be clear, this could affect even children who are vaccinated, since without herd immunity, there will be more circulating disease, and the risk of disease will be higher. From the trenches of the emergency department or urgent care, the waters will be muddied. Inconsistent vaccination in children could lead to cumbersome and worrisome testing for more people.\n\nThere are other issues at stake. Increased testing and medical visits will lead to shortages of blood culture bottles, IV fluids, and nurses, as well as antibiotic overuse, leading to increases in drug-resistant bacteria. And, because of health inequity, these challenges will be worse for babies of color or in poverty. Moreover, 80 percent of children are not seen in designated children’s hospitals with practitioners who are trained to perform procedures on children, which could add to the trauma sustained by our kids.\n\nSid has thankfully recovered from whatever virus caused his high fever—without an emergency department visit, testing, or antibiotics. Vaccinations shielded him from serious bacterial illness and from the painful, traumatic workup that many children may be subjected to if vaccine mandates are dropped. And in that case, physicians—and grandmothers—will lose the luxury of saying “It’s just a virus.”",

    "title": "Scarlett Johansson on the Today Show: Something strange is happening here.",
    "authors": ["Heather Schwedel"],
    "raw_text": "It’s unlikely that Scarlett Johansson co-hosting the final hour of the Today Show would crack any future list of the 10, or maybe even 50, most memorable or important things that happened the week of Jan. 20, 2025, given, well, everything. But that doesn’t make it any less puzzling.\n\nYes, the A-list actress spent the week filling in on the NBC morning show, and we’re still trying to figure out why. The official explanation that’s been given is that Hoda Kotb, Jenna Bush Hager’s beloved longtime co-host for the 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. Eastern hour of the show, recently left, and Hager is welcoming in her place a series of guest hosts. Others included Eva Longoria and Michelle Buteau last week; next week, Kelsea Ballerini and Ciara will be among those stopping by, part of a week of music-centric guest hosts. But most of them only stayed for a day. Johansson stayed for a week. (Well, four days, since Monday was a holiday, but still.)\n\nJohansson said on air that being a morning television host was actually a childhood dream of hers, which is a funny thing to say for someone who was a successful child actress. Her husband, Colin Jost, is a writer and cast member at Saturday Night Live, which also airs on NBC, so it stands to reason that her guest-hosting gig was helped along by already having an in at the network. Maybe it’s as simple as that, and when the opportunity arose, she realized she was well-placed to do it, and she figured why not? Is it actually the case that the Today Show would be happy to have any megafamous star co-host for a week, and ScarJo is the only one who took them up on it? Because, in case you need reminding, Johansson is really quite big. She has been nominated for Oscars. She’s a freaking Avenger. Her voice alone is so famous that an A.I. company allegedly attempted to steal it. (She threatened legal action.) She does not need the Today Show.\n\nDespite all this, you’re probably wondering how ScarJo is at the job. The answer is … pretty good! It shouldn’t be all that surprising that the art of being a charismatic, beautiful actress in movies translates pretty seamlessly to being a likable TV presenter. The bar may be low, but she cleared it: She showed us her hack for opening a pickle jar; she had a cute reunion with her onetime co-star Topher Grace; she wore sensible slacks. All she really has to do was smile and offer minimal details about her life—she could barely stand upright postpartum, much less go to a football game like Brittany Mahomes just did—to fill the average viewers with that “Wow, relatable queen!” feeling. Sure, almost as often, these attempts landed awkwardly, such as when she talked about how she studied the “algorithm” of her daughter’s school bus for weeks (?), but most of the time, Johansson was easygoing and sharp, particularly for the venue. For an infrequent watcher, the Today Show, and Hager’s hour in particular, is a surreal place: It’s the kind of environment where Hager seems absolutely bowled over by the coincidence of discovering that Johansson’s birthday is just three days before her own. Johansson played along with it all, and for the most part, seemed genuinely happy to be there.\n\nToday is a show for the masses, and with Johansson being best known these days for her role as Marvel’s Black Widow, perhaps that’s not so big a leap. But when Johansson first shot to fame, it was as the star of movies like Lost in Translation, and that’s another strange aspect of this: Imagine telling your 20-years-ago self that the young lady you just saw starring in a plaintive Sofia Coppola drama was going to be whooping it up on TV next to one of then-President George W. Bush’s daughters. The aughts were a long time ago indeed.\n\nGone are the days when there used to be a clear hierarchy of stardom, one where movie actresses sat squarely above television hosts. That world order has been collapsing for a while now, though it hasn’t gone away completely—Johansson herself is still primarily a movie actress, adhering to the old-school principle that movie stars don’t “do” TV. (She’s set the become the new face of yet another lucrative Hollywood franchise next summer.) But if they don’t do TV, they certainly don’t host Today, so what gives? We may never know, but I tend to think of this as akin to how the actress Sydney Sweeney has developed a reputation for endorsing tons of products, a practice that was until recently frowned upon: The old rules simply don’t matter anymore. If hot young things can hawk the ugliest shoes you’ve ever seen, why shouldn’t ScarJo replace Hoda? Because, by the way, fans are apparently calling for Johansson to be the show’s permanent replacement. Stranger things have happened.",

(It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nI am the only child of my father’s first marriage, my father had two children (one surviving) from his second marriage, and no children from his third marriage to my step-mother “Alice.” My father and Alice moved to my midwest town about 30 years ago, my half sibling remained on the West Coast. In their final years, all the caregiving fell to me, my father was sick for about seven years before he died, and my stepmother survived about another seven, becoming increasingly frail, and needing more and more care. As any caregiver of elderly parents can attest, it was time-consuming, as well as mentally, physically, and emotionally grueling.\n\nWhen “Alice” died, she had about half a million dollars in retirement accounts, which was divided equally between my half sibling and myself. Her main remaining asset was her home, which she left to me. After estate expenses and a few legacies, I will realize about $240,000 on the sale of her home. I recently wrote to my half sibling asking, as stipulated in Alice’s will, if there were any items of personal property that they wanted from Alice’s home. They replied that they wanted half the proceeds of the sale of the house because our father would have wanted them to have it, they need the money more than I do, and they had an unhappy childhood. I am reasonably financially secure, but not rich by any means. I have worked full-time for the past 45 years, and plan on putting a few more in before I retire. My half sibling made different choices in life and may, or may not, have less money than I do (I really don’t know).\n\nI am absolutely not going to give them half of the house money. I feel very comfortable stating that I earned every dime, and I have no idea if I will continue to enjoy reasonably good health. Before their letter arrived, I was going to send this sibling $10,000 out of my legacy, thinking it might help assuage their feelings and preserve our superficially cordial relationship. Am I right in thinking, in light of their feeling of entitlement, that $10,000 will not preserve the peace between us, and I may as well throw it away?\n\n—Wicked Half Sister\n\nDear Wicked,\n\nCaregiving is one of the most demanding jobs and one of the most thankless. Clearly, Alice wanted to recognize this work so she included you in her estate plan. This was her decision, and you shouldn’t try to reinterpret it just because of someone else’s expectations. Alice left the property to you for a reason. It’s more than reasonable for you to stand firm in your decision to keep the money.\n\nIf you do choose to give your half sibling a financial gift, make sure it’s coming from a place of generosity, not out of guilt or obligation. Do it because you want to, not because you feel pressured to do so. You could reply to their request with something like, “I believe Alice left the home to me as a compensation for my many years of caregiving, and I think it’s fair to her—and to me—to honor that wish.” If you feel like sending them a $10,000 gift is the right thing to do, then I would consider doing it whether or not it preserves the peace between the two of you. In the same way that you shouldn’t offer them a gift out of obligation, you shouldn’t hold back on it out of punishment. Of course, that’s just my two cents, and you might discover that you feel differently. Either way, how they respond to your decision is their responsibility, not yours. Prioritize what feels right to you and focus on honoring your stepmom’s wishes—and your own well-being.\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nI am a single parent in NYC, living on a shoestring budget with three children under 10. I’m divorced, and my ex skipped town once the divorce was finalized. I received a small amount of alimony, and while the child support ordered was significant, I have no realistic hope of collecting it anytime soon. I am college-educated but have been out of the workforce for nine years. To boot, my liberal arts (poetry) education was not directly related to the work I did (data analysis), and so I have struggled mightily to find a job here in New York. Last year, I consulted an expensive, well-connected career counselor who confirmed that I will continue to have a hard time finding work in the city with my current credential mismatch and long gap in my work history. (1,500-plus detailed applications trying to highlight my data experience and soft skills have proven this to be correct.) I currently make ends meet driving for Lyft. Finances are very tight and I regularly lose sleep hashing over the budget in my head.\n\nRecently, my mother died, and I inherited a surprise $100,000 after the estate settled. It is currently sitting in my bank account. What should I do with the money given my situation? Should I use it to pursue a credential? Which one? I worry about majoring in math or computer science given that I’m in my 40s and might not succeed. What about another credential with a surefire job available at graduation? Do those even exist anymore? Should I invest the money somehow and use the interest and part of the principal to lighten the financial load each month?\n\nI’m so worried about making the wrong decision and blowing the money on a degree that won’t pay off since that’s the main advice I’ve received so far in terms of finding a career. I need to survive 10 more years before my last child will graduate and go to college, and I’m taking it rent payment by rent payment at this point.\n\n—A Modest Windfall, a Major Decision\n\nDear Major Decision,\n\nThe stakes are high—you have an opportunity to change your financial situation and the stress it’s causing you. For that reason, I would strongly suggest that you consult with a financial professional before making any big moves. You might not feel like you can afford to see someone, but for a few hundred dollars you can get tailored advice that will be well worth it—even just for the peace of mind. A word of caution, because a lot of folks have negative experiences with financial advisors: Be sure to look for a fee-only Certified Financial Planner (CFP). A “fee-only” planner is paid a set rate for their services, as opposed to selling you financial products and getting paid by commissions. And a CFP is someone who has passed training and been credentialed by the CFP Board, which means they’ve also taken an oath to act in your best financial interest.\n\nIn the meantime, I imagine they’ll suggest some of the basics. A professional will probably highlight the importance of having an emergency fund. Since you’re essentially living paycheck to paycheck, there’s a good chance an emergency—a broken car, a health issue, a lack of child care that makes work impossible—could worsen your already stressful situation. As a rule of thumb, the fund should cover three to six months of essential living expenses. Once you have that secured, they might have you earmark a portion of your inheritance to lighten your financial load. In other words, set some money aside to cover rent or other major expenses for a short period. This could offer some temporary breathing room while you figure out what to do next.\n\nYou mentioned revisiting the idea of career training. Now that you have some money to work with, could you reconnect with a career counselor? They might have some ideas for certifications that are in demand and likely to lead to employment in the next couple of years. For example, teaching is a big career commitment, but earning some kind of teaching credential might be an option that leads to a stable career. Or maybe a counselor would push you to build on your existing experience in data analytics—there may be programs that are more affordable than going the route of getting a traditional degree, but could still give you a leg up in the job market. If you decide to go this route, you’ll want to talk to your CFP about it, too, because they can help you create a budget for getting the credentials you need while balancing your current expenses.\n\nThis might be a lot to ask, but is relocation an option? Moving could really ease a lot of your financial strain. Yes, it’s a big decision, and not one you want to make lightly, but your inheritance would stretch much further in a lower-cost-of-living city. Plus, the job prospects might be a little more accessible. Speaking of your ex, I wonder if you could hire a lawyer to help pursue some of that unpaid child support. Consider consulting a family law attorney to see what your options are, too.\n\nIn an extremely high-cost-of-living place like New York City, $100,000 might not seem like a massive amount, but it can definitely be a lifeline for you. Don’t underestimate the value of hiring professionals to walk you through your options. You deserve a fresh start—and a good night’s sleep.\n\n—Kristin\n\nClassic Prudie",

    "raw_text": "Care and Feeding is Slate’s parenting advice column. Have a question for Care and Feeding? Submit it here or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI am 18 years old and just finished my first year of college at my dream university. I learned a new programming language, became the president of a club, was a teaching assistant this past semester, and became friends with my roommate. My parents raised me to be independent from a young age, and I was more than ready to step out into the world. But my parents can’t seem to let up one annoying habit that’s keeping me from feeling like an adult.\n\nI wasn’t allowed any internet access until middle school and didn’t get my first cell phone until I turned 12. In the beginning, it was heavily monitored, but they let up on this slowly over the course of three years—except for Life360. While I was still in high school, my parents were always calling me while I was driving, questioning me about why I was going wherever I was going, why I was taking this road instead of that one, and why I was on the highway. They’d accuse me of lying about where Maps/Waze took me because it wasn’t the route they would have taken. They’d scold me after the two-mile drive home from my school because the software clocked me going 47 when the highest speed limit on my route was… 50. And this didn’t stop when I went away to college!\n\nI’ve been called in the middle of a lecture that got moved to Zoom, with my mother demanding to know why I was skipping class. I’ve been “caught in the crime” of arriving home from Walmart on a Thursday night at the ungodly hour of 9:30 p.m. and grilled about a walk at dusk to attend a club meeting. And then my mother got upset over me NOT leaving my dorm over the course of a weekend. I haven’t ever broken their trust concerning my location. This isn’t punishment for anything I did wrong, and I don’t know how to win back the trust I never lost. How do I confront people who have this level of confidence in their authority? Should I do it face to face, while I’m home for the summer, or wait until I’m back in a dorm again?\n\n—Surveilled in the South\n\nDear Surveilled,\n\nI wouldn’t confront them. I would just stop answering the phone when they call. (If they object to this, you can politely let them know it’s not safe to answer the phone when you’re driving, and it’s unacceptable to answer the phone when you’re in class—an explanation that has the virtue of being absolutely true.) Your only other option, as I see it, is to give up the phone they pay for, that’s on the family plan and that they can monitor in any way they choose, and find a way to pay for your own phone. And if they don’t like this, you can tell them that now that you’ve turned 18, you feel it’s important to take responsibility for yourself in any way you can—and remind them that they’re the ones who taught you to be independent (though I’ve got to say I’m not sure what you mean by this, under the circumstances).\n\nWant Advice From Care and Feeding?\n\nSubmit your questions about parenting and family life here. It’s anonymous! (Questions may be edited for publication.)\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI (they/them) have always known that I wanted to have kids. However, I’m 31 now and single, as I always have been. I have an income that’s nice enough for a single person but is extremely modest. I rent my home, and I live some distance from my family (who I’m not sure I’d want that closely involved in the day-to-day life of any hypothetical child anyway). Still, now that I’m in my 30s, it seems to me I really need to start working on this if I’m going to make it happen, but it feels impossible. From finding a sperm donor to raising a child, the whole thing seems daunting. I have a supportive network of friends, which is great, but none of them want children so it’s hard to imagine them acting as the sort of extended family a child needs (does a child need that?). I find myself envious of people who get pregnant by accident since that’s never going to happen to me (failing some massive changes in my life/self, or something truly horrific occurring). How do I even begin undertaking something like this on my own? Is it even responsible to do so?\n\n—Baby Fever\n\nDear Baby Fever,\n\nI’ll be honest with you: I remember contemplating the same questions when I was in my mid-30s, for my own reasons. I got lucky and met the man who is my daughter’s father at what seemed to me the eleventh hour. If I hadn’t, I might very well have pursued the path you’re considering (though I also thought seriously about adopting).\n\nI’ll tackle the pragmatic part of this first. You need to gather as much information as you can. One good source I’ve found, which walks you through the process, isFamily Equality, which will take you step-by-step through various ways to become a parent. It will help you feel less overwhelmed, I think, and also lay out for you some things you may not yet have thought about. For example, although the cost of using anonymous donor sperm through a sperm bank may seem out of reach, and known donor sperm—from a friend or acquaintance who’s on board to help you achieve your dream of parenthood—may be “free,” the legal expenses associated with ensuring that your parentage is clearly defined may even the financial scales. And leaving aside matters of money, thechoice between a known and unknown donor is a crucial first step if you feel sure you want to become a parent through pregnancy.\n\nSome of the other “practical” things that are worrying you—how much money you make, the fact that you don’t own your own home—I would consider less pressing. People of modest means have been having children since time immemorial. It is certainly possible to be a parent—and be a good parent—without every bell and whistle that our culture urges us to provide. If you love your child and keep them fed and warm and safe, you can make this work. And if the friends you already have love you, they will also love your child, whether or not they ever decide to have children of their own. You will also make new friends, I promise (children, once they are beyond infancy, have a way of bringing their parents into contact—lots and lots of contact—with other parents).\n\nThe question is: How much do you want this, and why? That’s what I’d spend my energy on at this juncture. Be as sure—and as clear-eyed about why—as you’re able to be. It is not “irresponsible” to have a child if you want to. I’ll tell you that for me, it was the single best thing I ever did; it’s still my favorite thing about my life (and my grown daughter is my favorite person!). But there’s no turning back from this, and it will change your life forever—so take some time to think it through, OK?\n\nCatch Up on Care and Feeding\n\n• If you missed Friday’s column, read it here.\n\n• Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy son is 10, my daughter is 8. Both of them go to the afterschool program at school twice a week. Last week, my son was involved in a playground incident. He and his friend, and my daughter and her friends, were playing two separate games that involved the play structures. My son had purposely fallen to the floor of the play structure, having “died” in the wizard game he was playing with a friend. He was just getting up when his sister’s best friend, who was running, tripped over him and fell, hard, breaking her arm in the process. The injured child and my daughter agree that this was an accident and no one was at fault. The afterschool program does too (though it’s been pointed out that both running and lying down on the structures are against the rules). In any case, my daughter’s friend’s parents don’t blame my son. No one blames my son. And yet he still feels very guilty about this. He understands that it was just a bad coincidence, but he still feels at fault. How do we get him to stop beating himself up over this?\n\n—Feeling Like the Guilty Party\n\nDear Feeling,\n\nSo he knows he’s not at fault, but he still feels terrible about his role in what happened. Why is that a bad thing? Why would you want him to shake it off after a week?\n\nIt’s healthy to feel bad about having had a role, however unintentionally, however accidentally, in someone else’s misfortune. Let him work through this on his own, on his own timetable. Letting him know that it’s natural to feel the way he feels, that kind and compassionate people are genuinely sorry when they cause anyone pain; assure him that this often happens in the course of our lives. Let him take this in, and be available to talk it over with him if he wants to. (And if he wants to do something nice for the child with the broken arm, let him do that—not because he “owes” her that but because it’s a lovely thing to do.) But trying to get him to let go of feeling “guilty” would be tantamount to teaching him that he should be coolly unaffected by pain he inadvertently caused. This is not a good lesson to teach our children.\n\nSlate Plus Members Get More Advice from Michelle Each Week\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy 16-year-old son, Ernie, has always had a flair for the dramatic. I also have fraternal 13-year-old twin daughters, Anna and Amelia. A few days ago, Anna came to me with this information: It seems that Ernie had drafted a love poem in Google Docs on his school account (I’m not sure if the school monitors what kids write there, but that was a stupid move regardless). He meant to text the document to his good friend Julia, to get her opinion on it, but instead accidentally sent it to Amelia—who has been blackmailing him over it ever since!\n\nAnna told me this had been going on for two weeks without her realizing it, that she’d only found out about it the other day when Amelia tried to use the poem as leverage to get Ernie to drive her and Anna and their friend to the movies after my husband and I and the friend’s mom all said we couldn’t drive them. (This scheme was also illegal, by the way—not just mean: Ernie is still in the phase of driving where he has his license but isn’t allowed to drive with kids in the car other than his own siblings.) My husband thinks Amelia’s punishment should be two weeks without her phone, and then we leave it at that. He’s opposed to our doing anything else, including extending the punishment, trying to discover why Ernie went along with his sister’s blackmail scheme, and making any effort to get the family back together again (Amelia isn’t speaking to Anna or Ernie). Am I overreacting, as my husband insists?\n\n—Mother of A Mess\n\nDear Mother,\n\nYep, you sure are. I think your husband’s punishment plan fits the crime, and I think you need to let the kids work this one out on their own. You don’t have to play Sherlock Holmes, either. I’d venture to say that Ernie was susceptible to Amelia’s taking advantage of him because he was deeply embarrassed by her having read his poem and deeply scared about the prospect of her sharing it with others. You’d be surprised (I guess) by how far teens are willing to go to avoid feeling any more humiliated than they already do.\n\n—Michelle\n\nMore Advice From Slate",

    "authors": ["Jenée Desmond-Harris"],
    "raw_text": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here. (It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’ve been friends with Julie for almost 20 years. I have always admired her self-conviction, confidence, and ability to know/go after what she wants without being burdened by the thoughts or opinions of others. She has a strong self of sense that I have always wished I could figure out. Julie has always been clear she does not want children and, until six years ago, steered clear of dating men with children. She met Ben at a mutual friend’s destination wedding and had a fling with him that continued once the wedding weekend came to an end. We were all surprised that their relationship continued and blossomed into an engagement because Ben has a son from a previous relationship. Julie said that they were able to make it work because Ben only had his son, Jalen, 50 percent of the time so she and Ben spent a lot of time together when Jalen was with his mom and then when he was with Ben, she was “around” but focused on her work, hobbies, and friends. Over the years, we saw the three of them together a few times and Julie had the role of “dad’s fun girlfriend.” Jalen seemed comfortable and friendly with Julie, much like all of the kids in our friend group are toward her (she doesn’t dislike children, just doesn’t want any).\n\nAbout six weeks ago, Jalen’s mother passed away unexpectedly after a cardiac event. Shortly after the funeral, Julie broke off her engagement with Ben and moved out. Over brunch recently, she told me that once she found out that Ben wasn’t going to share custody of Jalen with his maternal grandparents, she decided that she couldn’t figure out a way to make it work with Jalen living with Ben full-time and decided to move on. She talked about how things might be different if Ben had been open to boarding school for Jalen or a shared custody arrangement with grandparents but she only signed on for being with someone with 50 percent custody, not 100 percent. I honestly shouldn’t be shocked—this is very on-brand for Julie, and something I probably would’ve admired about her in the past—the courage to know when a situation isn’t going to work and extricating oneself from it is not one that many know how to do.\n\nHowever, all I can think is that Julie is a callous and selfish person! I know she did the right thing because it is better for Jalen to not grow up with a stepmother who resents his presence but she’s been in his life for six years! She was ready to marry Ben! I can’t wrap my head around the type of person who can just up and leave that matter-of-factly. My husband has become close to Ben the past few years and says Ben was blindsided and although he knew when they started dating she didn’t want kids, thought that she had at least accepted and liked Jalen. I guess the breakup conversation was pretty cold and emotionless and Ben says he’s never really seen that side of her except for when she was on a business call. Julie and I usually do a lot of things together during the holiday season and she has been texting to set up dates for us to get together but I just can’t bring myself to commit. I just don’t want to be around her as she talks like the past six years didn’t happen and she didn’t just break up with her fiancé because he wouldn’t send his kid to boarding school to make life more convenient for her. I hate feeling like this. I don’t have kids of my own so it’s not even like a maternal instinct is coming out. Julie has made decisions in the past that I don’t agree with but none have affected me quite like this. How do I get past this?\n\n—Not Brave, Not Selfish\n\nDear Not Brave, Not Selfish,\n\nFor what it’s worth, I think Julie behaved with integrity. She did what a lot of people fail to do, which was to be honest with herself about her feelings and act accordingly rather than A) lying to herself, B) trying to force others to change, or C) making everyone around her miserable. As you mentioned, Jalen deserves better than a stepmother who resents his constant presence, and I think she knew that. If she’d continued the relationship, just imagine how things could have played out. Even if she managed to love Jalen and hide the fact that she wished he’d been shipped off to boarding school, she would not have had the relationship with Ben she wanted. I’m almost 100 percent sure they would have ended up splitting up over the tension caused by being full-time parents—and mind you, this could have happened after multiple years of Jaden growing more and more attached to her!\n\nBut you don’t have to agree with that assessment. If there is something you just don’t like or trust about a person who can’t pull out all the stops to put a child’s needs ahead of their own, that’s fair. And you should not have to be around someone whose causal attitude toward her life choices puts a knot in your stomach. If you don’t respect Julie or enjoy spending time with her, you don’t have to try to ignore your feelings. Also, if you try to suppress them it won’t work. Your judgment will come out in the way you treat her and neither of you will get what you need from the relationship. It’s time to create some distance. You know who’s set a great example for you to follow when it comes to getting out of a situation in which you don’t feel good, and aren’t able to be your authentic self? Julie.\n\nGet Even More Advice From the Dear Prudence Podcast\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am on the autistic spectrum, and I lack the ability to completely hide this—specifically, the longer or more interactions I have with a person. So, I am wondering when it comes to dating should I be up front and include this information in the about me profile and hope that someone is open to dating someone on the spectrum or try and hide this until the person starts making commits or asking questions as usual?\n\n—Mask On or Off\n\nDear Mask On or Off,\n\nI want to be careful not to suggest that you owe any of your personal health information to the many random people who may be perusing your dating profile on any given day. You don’t. But I think it does make sense to share it there, and maybe even mention it again in your initial “Hey, I liked your profile” chat, to cover those who think you’re cute and have swiped on you without reading a word of what you wrote.\n\nWhen it comes to what exactly to say, put yourself in the mindset of sharing something about yourself in the way you might share it with a friend. You’re not giving a warning, telling a secret, or unloading baggage—you’re helping your potential date get to know you. How you put it will depend on your personality, how autism presents for you, and what the topic you’re discussing is, but I could imagine something like “I’d love to meet up. Being on the spectrum, texting isn’t really my favorite,” or “I’m a big texter more than a talker—it might be an autism thing.” Or you could just work it into a casual update like “I’m good! I was just listening to a podcast about autism” or “Work was fine. My autism on top of remote work can be an interesting combination but I’m starting to get to know some of my coworkers better.”\n\nDoing this will allow you to screen out people) who have negative feelings about your being on the spectrum, and will increase your chances of meeting someone who can relate to your experience. More importantly, you’ll be giving yourself the gift of dating free from what I can only imagine is an incredibly draining internal dialogue (Have they noticed? Am I masking? Should I stop masking? Are they going to ask a question? Should I make an announcement? Before or after the entrée arrives?) that distracts from your ability to enjoy yourself and get to know potential romantic partners. Dating is tough enough without all that.\n\nHow to Get Advice From Prudie\n\nSubmit your questions anonymously here. (Questions may be edited for publication.) Join the live chat every Monday at noon (and submit your comments) here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nIn five months, I’ll be graduating from college and moving across the country. I’m super excited about that. I also just met a guy two months ago and every time we’ve run into each other, we end up sitting together for hours talking. We talk about everything; he’s always interested in my thoughts from cooking to philosophical questions. I also ask him these sorts of questions. I think he likes me as he can’t stop looking at me in group settings and others say he starts smiling brightly when he sees me. I feel really happy when I think of him. The issue is he’s a junior so we’ll be separated by a six-hour plane ride next year. What sort of relationship structure should I propose since there’s a clear end date but I want to get involved with him romantically?\n\n—December-to-May Romance\n\nDear December-to-May Romance,\n\nWhen you say, “What sort of relationship structure should I propose?” I’m imagining you presenting him with a slide deck that lists options from “friends with benefits with the option for long-distance visits if approved by both parties” to “monogamous relationship for four months with a one month wind-down period” and ends with a recommendation before asking for questions or comments. You may be taking too formal an approach to this. I do understand the urge to plan things out. Maybe that’s your way of trying to make sure that you won’t get hurt. Understandable. But I have bad news: That’s impossible! People change, feelings change, love is unpredictable and we rarely get the exact relationship we imagine when we decide we like someone and they like us back.\n\nThe most important sentence in your letter, in my opinion, is, “I feel really happy when I think of him.” Let’s keep that going. Give yourself more to feel happy about. Propose a date. Not an entire relationship, but a date! Check in with yourself afterward. Are you still feeling happy? Do you still have the sense that he likes you? Keep hanging out! Keep assessing whether it feels good. He’ll be doing the same on his end. Over the course of five months, you could get tired of each other or realize you’re better off as friends. One of you might meet the love of your life and ghost the other (I hope not! But it might happen). Or you might decide you want to spend the rest of your lives together, and suddenly a six-hour flight won’t seem too bad. There are thousands of other possibilities in between. But there’s not much you can do right now to determine how you’ll each feel in May. All you know for sure is that you like this guy and the clock is ticking. Make your move.\n\nClassic Prudie",

    "title": "Trump Isn’t Going to Like the Fallout From His Fight With Colombia",
    "authors": ["Nitish Pahwa"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFor a few hours on Sunday, the United States and Colombia engaged in a full-blown economic tête-à-tête. President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that “two repatriation flights” of to-be-deported U.S. immigrants “were not allowed to land in Colombia.” This spurred him to impose “urgent and decisive retaliatory measures” against the South American ally that included a 25 percent tariff on all imports, a travel ban on Colombian government officials “and all Allies and Supporters,” increased surveillance of all Colombian nationals and goods within U.S. borders, and sanctions on cross-country financial transactions.\n\nThe diverted planes were real, but there were some missing details. Colombia had previously agreed to accept these passengers, according to CNN, but the government had backtracked because of how the deportees had been treated. As Colombian President Gustavo Petro noted in a Sunday-morning public statement, the immigrants in question had been loaded onto military-owned airplanes instead of chartered civilian aircraft—a “highly unusual” move, as Rolling Stone put it. “We will receive our fellow citizens on civilian planes, without treating them like criminals,” Petro had written, hours before Trump came in with the threats.\n\nIn subsequent posts, Petro highlighted the fact that he had temporarily blocked such flights from the Biden administration in 2023 for similar reasons, and later responded to Trump with a lengthy tweet decrying American racism and announcing a 50 percent counter-tariff on imports of U.S. goods.\n\nThe defiance didn’t last long, however. In response to warnings from domestic experts that this tariff clash would decimate Colombia’s economy, Petro’s administration agreed to Trump’s repatriation terms and has sidestepped the trade war, for now. The White House boasted that the South American nation would facilitate “unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft.” (Per the New York Times, the U.S. government did make some concessions to Colombia by agreeing not to handcuff and photograph the deportees, and dispatching Homeland Security staffers, instead of military officers, as flight escorts.)\n\nMeanwhile, Colombia’s foreign ministry insisted that it would grant the deportees “decent conditions as citizens subject to rights,” use the presidential air fleet to pick up deportees who would have otherwise become passengers on military planes (so as to “guarantee respect for the rights of citizens and to carry out medical monitoring if necessary”), and dispatch officials to Washington this week to iron out details with Trump.\n\nColombia isn’t the first nation to have materially countered Trump’s deportation plans. Still, its tiff with the U.S. is indicative of some lesser-known trade entanglements between North and South America—and of the potential for the Trump administration to hurt Americans’ pocketbooks in its craven pursuit of mass deportations.\n\nThe impact of the bout between the two nations was felt as it unfolded: a price spike for arabica coffee futures on the European markets (the U.S. receives 30 percent of its coffee supply from Colombia), heightened American fears that there wouldn’t be enough fresh-cut flowers (imported, overwhelmingly, from Colombia) stocked on store shelves in time for Valentine’s Day, and shake-ups in the markets for U.S. oil and corn exports. (Colombia takes in billions of dollars’ worth of both each year.)\n\nAs WLRN Public Media notes, Colombia is the United States’ 10th-largest trading partner by weight and “the largest country of origin for imports” processed through south Florida. Those include plenty of agricultural products, which have already proved to be a sore spot between the two nations; Colombia provoked American ire last year when it raised tariffs on U.S. milk powder and began an investigation into its northern neighbor’s lavish corn subsidies, sparking bipartisan worry that U.S. corn producers could lose an important customer.\n\nBut beyond trade relations, there’s the important fact that Colombia has long been the United States’ closest Latin American ally: The country is an eager partner in taking down drug traffickers in the region, and it serves as a liberal democratic counterpart to its authoritarian neighbor Venezuela. As such, the Trump–Petro spat is already provoking worries within Latin America more broadly.\n\nOn Thursday, all Latin American heads of state will meet for an “emergency summit” to discuss “migration, the environment and regional unity,” per the Financial Times. Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia will obviously be key players here, but so will Panama, whose government has been roiled by Trump’s repeated threats to “take back” the Panama Canal. Even before Joe Biden had left office, Petro and the presidents of Chile, Bolivia, and Mexico had banded together to assure that the canal would remain under Panamanian control.\n\nSure, Trump could continue to aim tariffs at these countries, but it wouldn’t be as easy to go after an entire bloc. As the Colombian writer Cruz Bonlarron Martínez points out in a Hill op-ed, Latin America and the Caribbean account for “21.3 percent of U.S. foreign trade, equal to over $1 trillion. … If the region consciously decided to look towards other trading partners, the U.S. economy would feel the effects, and not just in coffee prices.” The region as a whole constitutes “the world’s leading net food exporter,” according to the United Nations.\n\nIn addition, while the bulk of American imports hail from Mexico, the U.S. also receives essential products from specialist countries like Peru (berries and minerals), Chile (copper, which has particularly high global demand), Bolivia (manufacturing metals), Brazil (machine equipment), Guatemala (textiles), and the Dominican Republic (medical tech). These countries collectively hold a varied basket of goods that would pinch Americans’ pockets if they earned Trump’s tariffs treatment.\n\nWhat’s more, these countries are also earning the support of far-flung allies. A Canadian ex-minister is calling for a strategic coalition between nations that have been attacked by Trump—including Mexico, Panama, and Denmark—and encouraging her country to publish a list of U.S. goods that would be affected by the tariffs Canada is already planning in retaliation to Trump (for example: machine components, chemicals, and energy). That planned strike-back has cross-partisan support among the U.S.’s northern neighbors.\n\nSo far, Latin American leaders have not been as aggressive with Trump as Petro was on Sunday, but they have been just as openly concerned over the human rights and dignified treatment of deported immigrants. Before the weekend’s incidents, leaders from Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico teamed up with seven regional neighbors to release a joint statement calling for a “humanistic approach” to deportations. Earlier this month, Honduras’ president had threatened to kick U.S. military officers out of her borders in response to “a hostile attitude of mass expulsion of our brothers.” And while Mexico has pledged to cooperate with repatriation efforts, it has ruled out any cooperation with the “Remain in Mexico” initiative that pushes asylum-seekers to remain south of the Rio Grande while waiting for an approval hearing that could take years to schedule. The country’s president has beefed up immigration-assistance infrastructure and already alluded to “a scheme in place in case there is any violation of the human rights of Mexicans who arrive in our country.” Those sentiments were only reinforced on Saturday, when leaders in Brazil’s government found out that the deportees the country was receiving from the U.S. had been shackled in handcuffs and denied basic necessities like drinkable water and bathroom access.\n\nHere, then, is a firm commitment to the human rights of the Latin American diaspora, no matter what U.S. policy looks like. With this ramping up of regional alliances and international solidarity efforts, the region is already hinting that, indeed, it has a decent bit of economic leverage as a collective and will hardly rule it out if Trump—who has referred to Latin American immigrants as “poisoning the blood” of the U.S.—continues to treat immigrants as less than human. You can expect a lot of everyday essentials, from fruits to clothes to lifesaving machines, to become much pricier should Trump’s zeal for mass deportations be countered with further trade-warring from onetime allies.\n\nWe already saw, in Trump’s first term, what can happen when anti-immigrant zealots also dictate international economic policy—it severely upsets how American businesses expect to function and throws all prices and projections into chaos.",

    "authors": ["Allison Price"],
    "raw_text": "Care and Feeding is Slate’s parenting advice column. Have a question for Care and Feeding? Submit it here or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI don’t know how to put this any other way, but we’re pretty sure our 5-year-old is a genius; I know every parent says that (and they’re probably right!) but our son seems very much like he’s the inspiration for young Sheldon. He can add, subtract, multiply, find squares, find factors, etc. He can read multisyllabic words and complex texts. He’s due to start kindergarten in the fall but he’s really way past it already. We can’t afford private school and we both work, so homeschooling is not an option. Our local district has no gifted program to speak of, although the principal said that they can differentiate. (How do you do that in kindergarten when fractions aren’t part of the kindergarten curriculum?) We’re at a loss as to how we can help him without spending loads of money on enrichment to make up for the fact that his school can’t do much for him beyond socialization (although that’s not nothing, of course). Any guidance on how to help him reach his potential without breaking the bank?\n\n—Confused Mary Cooper\n\nDear Confused Mary Cooper,\n\nFor now, I would enroll him in kindergarten and be prepared to have conversations (possibly several) with his teacher about his abilities. He or she might see the gulf between their curriculum and his capabilities and elevate his case to school leadership. At that point, it’s possible that they would have more “proof” and motivation to help you think creatively on behalf of your child. (Jumping grades, for example, might be on the table, although it’s not a decision to be made lightly since it comes with lots of socialization complications.) On the other hand, you and his teacher might find that although his abilities are advanced, the subject matter and peer interactions are enough to keep him engaged and still give him ways to grow. But, overall, I think your concerns about differentiation within the classroom are well-founded. There is only so much one teacher can do for two dozen kids.\n\nIn terms of enriching him outside the classroom, I am afraid the hefty bill might be inevitable. On the plus (?) side, activities and summer camp are expensive no matter how smart a kid is! And it’s still less money than daycare! Jokes aside, not every enrichment activity has to be super brainy and specialized. Music lessons are a great moderate-cost activity that is still heavily mathematical in nature. And local colleges may have summer programs for gifted kids that operate on a sliding scale. Khan Academy might be worth exploring to help your child advance either within the school classroom or on his own at home. Unlike some other online learning platforms, the instruction is self-paced and thus more flexible to the user.\n\nIf you do decide that private school is the answer, the Davidson Institute has a list of possible scholarship sources on its website. This might also be an opportunity to ask family members whether they can help chip in for tuition. As we know, it takes a village, and your loved ones might want to help the boy they love reach his potential.\n\nCatch Up on Care and Feeding\n\n• If you missed Sunday’s column, read it here.\n\n• Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI have a 9-year-old son in third grade who doesn’t test well. He was diagnosed with ADHD and, despite having accommodations, he still is testing at a kindergarten or first-grade level in reading and around first or second grade in math. At his recent individualized education program (IEP) meeting, the teacher was going over what areas he is behind in, and I was shocked at some of them, such as reordering in math equations and solving equations where you have to borrow or carry. He has been doing those types of problems seamlessly at home; he has even been asking his dad to give him math problems every day where he has to carry or borrow. Additionally, at home, he can (slowly) read a story to us and then answer reading comprehension questions correctly. And despite barely passing Spanish in school, he held his own on a recent trip to Mexico, both speaking Spanish and identifying written words.\n\nI am frustrated and stuck. The schools discourage having kids repeat a grade anymore, especially when they have an IEP, so I know he won’t fail, but I am wondering what the point is in even sending him to school or having him test when it is not reflective of what he knows. Transferring to a private school with a less traditional instruction model isn’t really an option due to his ADHD and impulsivity issues. Homeschooling or finding a virtual school option is a possibility but with the latter, we’d still have the testing issues. Should we just continue in traditional school and hope that as he gets older, he’ll test better? Should we try homeschooling for a year and see if it improves? Do tests even really matter? My husband thinks we should just continue as is and make sure that he knows what he is supposed to know and not pay attention to grades or scores, but I hate when he comes home with yet another D on an assignment; he seems so upset and defeated. I worry about the narrative this is sending him about himself.\n\n—Don’t Test Me\n\nDear Don’t Test,\n\nIf your son’s accommodations aren’t helping him compensate for his disability, they aren’t the right accommodations. Unfortunately, parents in situations like yours often find themselves “outgunned” or outnumbered when trying to advocate for their kids. I would enlist the help of an educational advocate, whose job is to help parents effectively advocate and participate as an active member of their child’s education team. Services might include individualized education program (IEP) review, IEP meeting preparation sessions, accommodation suggestions, or direct engagement with the school. Their goal is to ensure you are informed and your concerns are heard so that both you and the school staff can be satisfied with your child’s education plan.\n\nI’d also try to surreptitiously record the types of scenarios you mention in your letter. They demonstrate the significant gulf between your son’s at-home learning experience and how he is performing in school. Go so far as to take a test he did poorly on, reconstruct it in your own hand, and have him complete it at home (without knowing it’s the same test). I would be surprised if his teacher or counselor didn’t find all of this compelling and worthy of a meeting and IEP amendment.\n\nIf these adjustments to his public school experience do not bear fruit, then maybe a trial year of homeschooling couldn’t hurt. I appreciate your husband’s suggestion to de-emphasize grades, but your son’s feeling of dejection is more salient to me. We want kids to enjoy learning and see themselves as people who can learn. Consistently failing after working hard can be really demoralizing to kids and poison their self-esteem and self-worth in long-lasting ways. If you think you are up to the challenge of being an effective homeschooler, and you can also get him the therapies and interventions he’ll need to learn to manage his ADHD, then it sounds like an option you should consider.\n\nWant Advice From Care and Feeding?\n\nSubmit your questions about parenting and family life here. It’s anonymous! (Questions may be edited for publication.)\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI have a very smart, sometimes sweet but usually quite defiant 8-year-old stepdaughter. I’ve been in her life since she was 3. Her parents get along and co-parent very well, and we all hang out together and have a good relationship. Early on, I noticed that there was quite a bit of guilt-driven parenting on all sides—letting her run the show and giving in to everything she wanted, with little disciplining or correction of negative behaviors. Obviously, it’s normal for young kids to throw tantrums, but I would try to remind my partner that giving a child what they want following that behavior will only reinforce it. My partner would shrug it off and say she’ll grow out of it. Well, shockingly, she has not. She continues to throw massive tantrums whenever something doesn’t go her way, she rarely follows even simple requests (or at least not until we’ve asked six times), has a very hard time offering genuine apologies, and has an extremely entitled attitude. Simply put, she is spoiled.\n\nMy partner finally began to see this about a year ago, and changes have been made in our home to try to stop the behavior. We try to follow more positive reinforcement, though admittedly we sometimes fall off the horse. There have been some improvements but overall the issues still remain. The interesting part, though, is that at school we are told she is a completely different child—kind, helpful, respectful, and caring. When we’ve asked her why she acts differently at school, her response is “Because teachers don’t love you as much as parents do.” I do think that is part of it, but I believe it goes deeper than that. She has begun making more comments about her parents being separated lately (even though it happened before she can recall), and I have a gut feeling that the behavior is coming from underlying anger about that, which of course, is natural for her to feel. How do we validate her feelings, but still get her to realize she has a pretty great life? I get the sense she feels like she shouldn’t have to behave better at home because she views her situation as being inherently unfair. How can we break through her behavior if she feels entitled to it?\n\n—Struggling Stepparent\n\nDear Stepparent,\n\nDoes she act out in similar ways at her other parent’s home, or is it just you and your partner who are drawing her ire? If it’s a universal attitude she is displaying, have all the parents come together to enact a plan so that the same behaviors trigger the same consequences, no matter where she is? If not, that is one of the first things you should address. She needs to be held accountable in both home environments, and if it’s done in a consistent fashion, she’ll experience less whiplash—especially since having two households seems to be at the root of some of her behavior. I would be fair but firm in the consequences you dole out and be prepared to hold yourself to them. (For example, if no screen time is the punishment, would that actually cause more headaches for you ?) No more asking six times; if three doesn’t do the job, there needs to be a consequence, even if it means missing out on something important. Many people associate the book 1-2-3 Magic with toddler behavior management, but the approach can age up with kids and may be a good starting point for your family.\n\nI know the advice I am about to give may seem tiresome because my fellow columnists and I so often suggest this, but…. have you considered therapy? If your stepdaughter’s behavior really does stem from some resentment about the divorce, a third party could be very beneficial in helping her process her feelings and adjust her attitude. Family therapy would give her the opportunity to put some of her complex emotions into words and also give you all some guidance for what kinds of behaviors to allow and not—and how to respond. You would typically have a mix of individual sessions and group sessions, where the therapist can almost mediate conversations between you and your daughter. While 8 years old might seem young for therapy, I can tell you it’s made a world of difference for some of my friends with kids that same age during times of intense conflict. Your stepdaughter seems to be displaying some egocentricity, and therapy can help her see things from other points of view. Good luck!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI’m a mom of a 13-year-old son (and three older kids). My estranged wife of 35 years is his bio-parent and I adopted him at birth. I’m the bio-parent of our three oldest kids, and all four kids have the same known-donor dad. Eight years ago, my wife had a mental breakdown and spent two months in residential care. After a couple of years of trying hard to make things work, her depression, anxiety, and paranoia were too much for the kids and me to handle, and she’s been living in another city with her brother for the past five years. I pay rent to her brother and all of her bills, and for three years, I brought the kids out every weekend to visit with her. The older kids are now away at college and living adult lives, so I’ve been taking the 13-year-old for visits with his other mom. He has now decided he wants nothing to do with her, refusing to talk on the phone or visit her. She and I are still legally married because I fully support her financially and I don’t want her to lose her health insurance—and because I made a commitment to her years ago that I want to honor.\n\nI can’t disagree with his comments about how “She’s always drunk,” or “She monopolizes the conversations,” but it feels wrong to let him decide to not talk with her or visit with her. She cut things off with me a few years ago, refusing to let me stay the weekend at her brother’s place with her and the kids. (He has room and has always welcomed me with open arms.) My son recently discovered that, in our state, if we were to divorce, he’s at an age where he could decide whether to visit his other mom or not. He’s now encouraging me to divorce his other mom so he can refuse to visit her. Everything feels so wrong! How do I decide what to do? When does my obligation to my son override my obligation to my wife? How do I know if my insistence that our son continue to visit his mom is leading to trauma rather than connection?\n\n—Mom\n\nDear Mom,\n\nI wish I had a little more information before I gave advice; I am wondering whether your wife left you and the kids of her own accord, or whether that was a mutually agreed upon solution for her care needs. If she left your family in the sense of “walking out on you,” I would say you are more than meeting any commitment you made to her through your financial help. But if it was more about her care, and she never intended to abandon the kids, it gets more complicated.\n\nMy gut reaction is to follow your son’s wishes because I think a parent’s first responsibility must always be to their children—and it sounds like your wife’s behavior can be rather problematic when they get together (bad conversation skills are one thing, but being visibly drunk is something else entirely). However, mental illness is real and not the fault of the person, so I understand why abandoning these visits feels so undesirable to you. Regardless of her decision to cut off contact with you, it seems critical that you and she (and maybe the brother, if a mediating force is needed) discuss your son’s feelings and her behavior. Whether you each like it or not, you and your wife are co-parents, and I’m not sure it is reasonable for her to have contact with your son but be unwilling to discuss that son’s well-being together. She needs to know that her behavior is destroying her relationship with at least one of her kids. I hope she is in active therapy or other treatment so that she has ways to address the behavior if she chooses.\n\nI think it is time to consult a family law attorney who could properly guide you on your legal options. You don’t want to be put in jeopardy by withholding your son from his mother. Likewise, the attorney might know what options, aside from divorce, could give your son more agency in how he spends his time. This is not the situation anyone expects to be in when they commit to a partner and start a family together. I hope you, your wife, and the whole family will soon find peace and stability.\n\n—Allison\n\nMore Advice From Slate",

    "raw_text": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI didn’t really understand that my boyfriend might have an eating disorder until we went on a long vacation this December. I also have obsessive hobbies, a limited desire for sweets, and am pretty active so I thought we were similar.\n\nI knew he had a strict gym routine and was a careful eater, but I didn’t fully put the pieces together until I saw him doing this stuff every single day. He’s not technically underweight (I know because he weighs himself daily and tracks it)—he’s muscular with very low body fat. But he maintains that body with two hours of gym daily, nonnegotiable. We both had food poisoning on the day we left? He was still at the hotel gym. We went for a 12-mile hike? Gym afterward. He subsists only on lean protein, water, brown rice, and green vegetables, not just for daily life but for vacation too. He requested these things even when we went to cool restaurants. When he had a Christmas cookie, he thought he was sneaky in puking it up later.\n\nNow that I’ve noticed this, I’ve realized that most of his friends talk about their bodies in the same way. None of them seem to be bulking so much as they’re mostly cutting. Where does the line fall between disordered and careful? How do I bring this up with him? And if I do, are there even resources for men in their 30s? Everything I’ve seen seems aimed at teenage girls or at women.\n\n—Maybe This Is Fine? But Maybe Something’s Wrong\n\nDear Maybe,\n\nOnly a medical professional can make an official diagnosis, but it does sound to me that your boyfriend has a potentially disordered relationship with eating—one that reminds me of orthorexia. The current cult of personal optimization—which, for men, emphasizes a fixation on physical performance and mental discipline—certainly incentivizes extreme behavior. We as a society give certain passes on this kind of behavior to, for example, professional athletes. But you’re right that there’s a fine line between living a rigid lifestyle versus having an obsessive disorder, and it will take much more than an advice column response (or even a few conversations between you and your boyfriend) to figure out what’s going on. At the very least, the puking is a major red flag.\n\nWhether or not your boyfriend has a diagnosable condition, it sounds like his regimented habits may at least be a problem for your relationship. I think I would advise you to first frame the conversation with your boyfriend more in terms of whether he is willing to compromise on some of his habits when, for example, you’re on vacation and would like to enjoy a nice meal together, or when you’d like to take a day off from the gym to relax. Communicate how important it is for you to be able to share those experiences together. If he’s completely unwilling to budge an inch on his regimen, then you can bring up your concern about whether these choices that he’s making are healthy, and how they affect your relationship. Before the conversation, you may want to read through a few resources for guidance on talking to a loved one about potential eating disorders—here’s one from the National Eating Disorders Association and another from Cedars-Sinai.\n\nOverall, I deeply relate to your desire to figure out what’s “officially wrong” and to potentially help “fix” your partner for their own good, but in my experience, the only cards you have to play here are expressing your concern and deciding whether you’re coming along for the ride, should he make it clear that he’s sticking to his own course.\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie",

    "authors": ["Delia Cai"],
    "raw_text": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI was married for 12 years, and we have a daughter. There’s a 10-year age difference, and I was surprised when she—my roommate at the time—first came on to me. I was equally surprised when she ended the marriage with “You’ve been a good husband and a good father, but you got old, your hair fell out, and I’ve met someone else.” That was 20 years ago.\n\nNow I am an incel. Not the nasty, embittered woman-hating type, but an ordinary guy who likes women but can’t find a romantic partner. I have women friends who are partnered, gay, intentionally single, or looking for a man but are not interested in me due to an age gap. I’m in a few sporting and leisure groups but the same thing there. I live in a small town, and though one woman aware of my situation told me there are single available women around here, I don’t meet them. I asked one married woman friend if she knew any, and she laughed, saying, “Yes, but I wouldn’t inflict them on you.” I wondered if she really meant it the other way around.\n\nI’m on a couple of dating websites and have had two relationships through them, one lasting two years and the other 18 months. Both ended with me being unexpectedly dumped by text, with no reason given. One ordered me not to contact her again, and when I asked the other one, she texted me, saying I am a bully and a control freak. I’ve never before experienced any accusation like that—not even during that relationship, and never from the ex-wife, friends, family, workmates, or anyone else. I know I lack the emotional intelligence to read signs, given that most of the time it’s the man who suggests going to bed, and before my marriage, I always got one of two responses. Either “Whatever made you think I’d be interested in you?” or the more welcome but equally surprising “What took you so long?” In those days, I was often put in the “friend zone.”\n\nThe other dozens of approaches I’ve made on dating sites have been rejected. About half the women ignore the email; the rest give a reason. “You seem like a nice, interesting guy, but I don’t want to take things further.” If they don’t want a nice, interesting guy, what do they want? I’m keen to learn but know better than to ask. A work colleague in the same situation as mine said women see us as effeminate and not “real men.” I suspect being bald doesn’t help. My adult daughter—while sympathetic—says I’m just another example of “Nice guys finish last.” I get the gist of that, but like all of us, I know plenty of nice guys with lovely women partners. Where do I go from here?\n\n—Boo-Hoo-Hoo\n\nDear Boo-Hoo,\n\nIt sounds to me that you’re doing all the right things. You’re putting yourself out there, and you’re making connections. The question implicit in your letter is: How do you find a connection that lasts? It’s the question that plagues all of us, even those who are happily partnered up … for the moment. But there’s simply no easy answer. Luck may be a bigger component than any of us would like to think.\n\nWhat may be helpful to you on your quest for a long-term partner is a change in mindset that might feel counterintuitive. I want to challenge you to focus, for the time being, on simply making friends. Think of your social circle and wider community as a fishnet: Work on tending to that net—mending places where it may be broken, adding new material in areas that have worn thin, and making it wider and stronger. Take the hunt for romance off the table for now, because I think your search for a soulmate is putting too much pressure on yourself and making you a bit miserable.\n\nYou sound lonely and not entirely confident; those things are normal but are factors that can compound on top of one another into a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to dating. I feel for you. You’re starving for companionship and affection, but the sick irony of how attraction works is that people often sense when someone seems too hungry, and they back off. (After all, they want to be desired for who they are as individuals, not just because they’re the first warm body that has come along.) I know that may sound harsh, but it’s best to approach dating for a long-term partner with a decent sense of self-worth and a support network already in place, because otherwise, it’s going to be a very grueling slog ahead. So I would tend to those parts of your life.\n\nSeek connection from existing friends and loved ones who can bolster your feelings of belonging and confidence; experiment with forming new, low-pressure connections with neighbors and members of your sporting/leisure group. (It doesn’t matter if they’re mostly men.) Over time, I think you’ll find that feeling more linked to the world at large—and to yourself—will change the way you approach romantic prospects. You’ll be more confident and emotionally resilient, and the unavoidable natural ups and downs of dating will be something you can more easily take in stride. Because, yes, it takes luck but also belief.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI work from home and down the street from an elementary school. I had a good relationship with my neighbor. She was a single mom with a 5-year-old and a 9-year-old. The kids couldn’t walk home unless someone was there, and the 9-year-old was a bit too young to babysit. I volunteered to make the walk after school and leave my back door unlocked so that if an emergency happened, the kids could come over.\n\nIt worked fine at first, but my neighbor kept adding more and more. First, it was after-school pickups, then morning drop-offs because her work schedule was so hectic. Then she wanted me to watch her kids on weekends. I felt trapped and guilty since I was raised by a single dad and basically acted as a second parent to my younger siblings. I wasn’t getting paid, and it felt like pulling teeth to get her to pay for the food her kids ate. Talking to her about it was just another guilt trip.\n\nI hit my limit when she volunteered me to other mothers without checking with me first. Rather than alienating my entire small neighborhood, I went on a monthlong working holiday in December. Now I’m back home, and my neighbor has been love-bombing me and trying to sweet-talk me back into child care. She claims that her kids miss me. I enjoy her kids, but they like getting to watch unrestricted TV more than they like me. She isn’t taking no for an answer, or it doesn’t work for me anymore. I’m feeling pressed. Can I just lie and say I got a new, stricter job?\n\n—Gift Horse Done\n\nDear Gift Horse,\n\nYes, absolutely. Hopefully that lie will do the trick. You can even throw in a pointed reference to how uneven the neighborly favors have gotten. Next time she stops you at the mailbox to tell you about how the children miss you dearly, say, “I’m glad I could be there to help with the kids for a while, and I’m so happy I know I can count on you when I need some help too, right?” I guarantee she’ll start avoiding you.\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nFor a forthcoming advice column, we want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy parents retired to Florida three years ago. Since then, it has been a solid wall of complaints that we don’t visit enough and we are favoring my in-laws. My in-laws live in the same city as us and understand that my husband and I have professions that don’t stop for weekends or holidays. We usually will celebrate early or late, and our kids are just a little too old for the Santa myth.\n\nMy parents refuse to travel to us, despite the fact they have taken several international vacations. They put all the expense, hassle, and limited vacation time on us. I try to keep a weekly Zoom call for my kids to talk to my parents, but I am tired. It is me doing 90 percent of trying to maintain a relationship, and it isn’t “enough” for them. I am this close to telling my parents to shut the hell up. If they really wanted to see their grandchildren, they wouldn’t have moved so far away or never bothered to come back for a visit. Any conversation ends up with the same complaints. Is it time for some family silence?\n\n—All the Effort\n\nDear Effort,\n\nAlmost. There’s a funny book I read a while back called Never Split the Difference, which received a lot of hype because it was essentially negotiation tips from a former hostage negotiator. My biggest takeaway from it was that when you’re presented with unreasonable demands, ask the person, “How am I supposed to do that?” The idea is to get the person making the demands to do some problem-solving for you—for example, if someone is demanding a ransom, you hit them back with “But how am I supposed to get that much cash in 24 hours?” (I am doing some extreme paraphrasing; my apologies to the author Chris Voss.)\n\nI thought about this book while reading your letter because it sounds as if your parents are making some big demands that you’re simply unable to meet. It’s not not a bit of a hostage/ransom situation, where you’re expected to magically come up with the time and money for constant visits to Florida. So I’m curious if it’s worth trying this bit of negotiation on them: The next time they complain about why your family won’t visit them for Christmas, don’t get defensive. Explain the constraints on your ability to do so. Say something like, “Of course I want to spend time together, but I don’t have Christmas Day off. How am I supposed to make this work?,” with the eventual pivot to “Can you help me make this work?” If they can’t provide any useful answers, treat the issue like a perplexing math problem (“Well, I hope we figure this out one day!”) and go about your business. They might throw a tantrum and say you don’t care enough about them (“Maybe you should quit your job to spend time with us in the Villages!”), to which you can pull the same card again (“No, I want to have a good relationship with you guys, but I also need to keep my job in order to take care of my family. How can we make this work?”).\n\nIf that still leads nowhere, then suggest a break in visits, e.g., “It sounds like this isn’t workable for either of us!” My only other note is that it may be worth figuring out why they dislike visiting your city. Is it secretly hard for them to get around? Do they have some weird/bad memories associated with it? Perhaps they might be amenable to meeting somewhere in the middle for an occasional family vacation. It would be awesome if the reason they aren’t visiting you were easily fixable. Unfortunately, I wouldn’t count on it.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy brother-in-law moved into our extra room because he didn’t want to move in with his mom and his dad lives with extended family in a crowded house. I was pregnant at the time, and it was hell living with a surly teenager and a baby. My husband was often away, and the heavy lifting was left to me. My brother-in-law is 19 now and comes and goes as if our house is his personal hotel. He doesn’t pay rent and spends all his money on weed.\n\nOur toddler sleeps in a nook in our room. I think it is ridiculous. We have another room that isn’t even occupied half the time, and most nights my brother-in-law is gone. I found out I was pregnant again. I put my foot down and told my husband we can’t live like this. It’s high time that his brother grow the hell up and get out of our house. We have a growing family, and our child deserves a real room.\n\nHis brother exploded when we told him he needed to move out. He said he didn’t have “anywhere to go” and we didn’t have the “right” to have another baby and push him out. I told him he was a selfish prick who doesn’t get a veto over us having another baby. Since then, he has been doubling down on his awful behavior—leaving messes, refusing to help with bills, and generally acting like an ass. My husband keeps “talking” to his brother, but nothing changes. This pregnancy has been awful for me. I don’t need any more stress. I want to get a room set up for our toddler and the rest of the house ready for the baby. I am this close to just packing up and moving back in with my parents. Help!\n\n—Baby Room\n\nDear Room,\n\nIt’s time to spell out this ultimatum to your husband and give him a deadline: Either his adult brother moves out or you do. The most workable solution, which you may not like very much, is that you and your husband lend some financial support to his brother while he figures it out for a while, for the sake of getting him out of your house. But there’s no magical amount of conversations that will persuade your husband’s brother to make any changes on his own, not when he’s basically got a free pad to treat how he wishes.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy mother is barely 50 and refuses to wear her glasses. She will not physically text and instead uses speech-to-text. Most of her texts come out in a word salad that can’t be deciphered. I usually end up calling her for clarification or ignoring the texts altogether. Then she gets mad because she wanted me to pick up peanut butter and I have to ask what “peans udders” are.\n\nI am starting to get seriously worried because she still drives but can’t read even the aisle signs at the grocery store. She has already had three fender benders this fall and blamed them all on road conditions. We were lucky another car wasn’t involved in any of them. My mom claims I am overreacting and she isn’t that old yet, but she can’t even text me in basic English because she can’t see the screen. Help!\n\n—Can’t See\n\nDear See,\n\nIf your mother can’t meet the vision requirements to drive, it is illegal for her to do so—and, as you suspect, highly dangerous for everyone else on the road. It sounds as if your mother is in denial about aging (and is maybe self-conscious in general about how the glasses look), but this is a serious matter that you need to escalate to a top priority. Make it clear that you’re worried about her (and the driving public), and try to figure out what’s at the root of her dislike of the glasses. Is it because she feels old? Is it because she doesn’t like them? If there’s a workable solution (like getting a nicer pair of glasses or a contacts prescription), that would be ideal; however, if she’s simply being stubborn about appearing old or helpless, you may have to incentivize her in the same way that you’d deal with a stubborn teenager. “I’d love to take you to the farmers market on Sunday, but I need you to wear your glasses for me.” The words for me may be your biggest card to play here: Your mother might not think it makes sense for her to wear glasses, but if doing so will curry favor with you nonetheless, that’s a different incentive.\n\nIf that doesn’t work, you have to get serious with her. Tell her that you can help take care of her only if she takes care of herself as best as she can, which means wearing glasses. Raise a few unpleasant potential hypotheticals of what would happen in an extreme case, like if she gets into an accident, or if she’s not able to read her texts. She might have to miss an important family event that’s happening via the group chat, or she may one day have to move into an assisted living home. You would both hate for that to needlessly happen, right?\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nI just moved in with my boyfriend of eight months. This is quicker than I’d normally move in with someone, but I had problems with an awful landlord, and my boyfriend had just bought a house. Things have been going really well, except for one issue. My boyfriend’s hobby is woodworking, and he plans to furnish the house exclusively with pieces he builds himself.",

Please read the Terms carefully before using the Services. Do not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms. Slate may change or modify the Services or the Terms at any time. Such changes, revisions, or modifications shall be effective immediately upon being posted in relation to the Services.

User Submissions\n\nCertain areas of the Services may enable you to post comments, send emails, or otherwise provide information to Slate or other persons. You remain fully responsible for the materials that you provide to us or others, including without limitation information, audio recordings, photographs, documents, or other materials submitted, posted, uploaded, sent or otherwise transmitted to us or others (“User Content”). You agree not to provide User Content that:\n\n• Infringes on, misappropriates or otherwise violates the copyright, trademark, patent or other intellectual property right of any person;\n\n• Is false, misleading, libelous, slanderous, defamatory, obscene, abusive, hateful, or sexually-explicit;\n\n• Violates a person’s right to privacy or publicity;\n\n• Contains advertising or a solicitation of any kind;\n\n• Degrades others on the basis of gender, race, class, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual preference, orientation or identity, disability, or other classification;\n\n• Contains epithets or other language or material intended to intimidate or to incite violence; or\n\n• Violates any applicable local, state, national, or international law, or advocates illegal activity.\n\nIf the Services permit you to post or publish User Content, you may only post User Content that is original and that you have the right to post. By submitting User Content, you grant us a royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully sub-licensable, transferable, license to publish, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, edit, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works, make, sell, offer for sale, export, and otherwise use and exploit your User Content (or any portion thereof) in any way that we want and in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed. You hereby waive any moral rights you may have in your User Content. You represent that you have obtained all necessary permissions from any person identified in or implicated by your submission (including those shown in photographic content), and, in the case of minors, also from their parents or legal guardians, as appropriate.\n\nWe are not obligated to publish or use your User Content. Slate is not in any manner endorsing any User Content or Slate Content that it may publish or post on the Services and cannot, and will not, vouch for its reliability. Slate is not responsible for any User Content or Slate Content and has no duty to monitor the User Content or Slate Content posted on the Services. You use any information contained in User Content or Slate Content at your own risk. Slate and its designees have the right, in their sole discretion, to monitor, review, edit, remove, delete, disable, refuse, restrict, or terminate access to your User Content or the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, without prior notice and in our sole discretion, for any or no reason. The obligations that you have to us under these Terms shall survive termination of the Services, any use by you of the Services, any User Content on the Services, or these Terms. You will not continue to post any User Content that Slate has previously advised you not to post.\n\nIf you are under the age of 13, you may not submit any User Content to us. If you are under the age of 18 but at least 13 years of age, you may submit User Content only with the permission of, and under the supervision of, a parent or legal guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian agreeing to these rules for the benefit of an individual between the ages of 13 and 18, please be advised that you are fully responsible for his or her User Content and any legal liability that he or she may incur. Please see the “Children’s Privacy” section of our Privacy Policy, available here, for more information. Please contact us at slateoffice@slate.com if you have any concerns about your child or ward’s use of the Services.\n\n4. Subscription Services\n\nSubscription Services. Certain Services, such as Slate Plus, may be available only through creation of a subscription account and payment of a fee (“Subscription Services”). Through such Subscription Services accounts, you will have access to the Subscription Services for a fixed term, which will not renew automatically unless otherwise disclosed to you when you pay for the Subscription Services.\n\nAccess Restrictions. You are not authorized to access any Subscription Services unless you have opened a subscription account and paid the appropriate fee, have received access credentials (e.g., a username and password) from us, and are using those access credentials. You may not assist anyone else in accessing Subscription Services on an unauthorized basis, including by sharing your access credentials or providing any content or other materials that you obtained through Subscription Services to third parties. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access credentials and for all usage or activity on your Subscription Services accounts, including the use of Subscription Services by any third party authorized by you to use your access credentials. Such responsibility expressly includes any purchases made or other charges incurred on your credit card in connection with your use (or an authorized third party’s use) of the Subscription Services. In the event of any fraudulent, abusive or otherwise illegal activity on your Subscription Services accounts, we may, in our sole discretion, terminate those accounts and refer you to appropriate law enforcement agencies. You may be responsible for damages from any such fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity.\n\nAge and Billing Authorization. By subscribing to a Subscription Service, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age, that all information you submit is true and correct (including all credit card information), and that you are the authorized holder of the credit card.\n\nFees. You agree to pay all subscription fees and other charges to your Subscription Services accounts, including any applicable taxes. Slate and/or the particular service provider reserves the right to change the amount of, or the basis for determining, any subscription fees or other charges for the Subscription Services and to institute new subscription fees or other charges effective upon prior notice to you.\n\nMobile Access. Some Subscription Services are accessible only using a particular kind of device, such as an Apple iPad or an Amazon Kindle. You should investigate Subscription Services before you pay for access to them to ensure that they will work with your device because we will not refund any fees you paid if the Subscription Services to which you subscribe are not compatible. Also, certain Subscription Services may not be available for use in every jurisdiction, and we will not refund any fees you paid if the Subscription Services to which you subscribe are not available. For information on compatibility and availability, please visit the applicable provider’s website or contact us at mobile@slate.com before you subscribe.\n\nSuspension or Termination. We may suspend or terminate your access to Subscription Services at any time without notice to you. If we do so, you will not be responsible for fees associated with the Subscription Services after the termination becomes effective, but you will not have any other remedies against us, and we will not issue any refunds. If you have breached or violated any obligation under these Terms, you will not be entitled to any remedy.\n\nCancellation. To cancel your subscription to Subscription Services, you must follow the procedures described on the applicable provider’s website. If we do not list cancellation procedures for a particular Subscription Service, you must contact us at support@slate.com. We do not refund or prorate Subscription Services, or any other purchases made through the Services, for any reason. Requests to terminate subscriptions will be effective once the billing period in which we received the cancellation concludes.\n\n5. Registration for Non-Subscription Services\n\nYou may be asked to register for certain activities in connection with the Services other than Subscription Services (see Section 4 for a discussion of Subscription Services). When you register, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself as requested or directed and to promptly update this information to maintain its accuracy. Slate has the right to suspend or terminate any account or other registration and to refuse any and all current or future use if it suspects that such information is inaccurate or incomplete. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password and username that you are given or select, and you are responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.\n\n6. Intellectual Property\n\nAll content, information, materials, computer code, and software that are part of the Services other than your User Content (collectively, the “Slate Content”) is the property of Slate or third parties. You may access, use and display the Services on a single computer or device and download and print copies of the Slate Content only for non-commercial, informational, personal use, without modification or alteration in any way, and only so long as you comply with these Terms. You may not download or print bulk copies of the Slate Content for any purposes.\n\nNon-commercial use does not include the use of Slate Content without prior written consent from Slate in connection with:\n\n• the development of any software program, model, algorithm, or other generative AI tool, including, but not limited to, training or using the Slate Content in connection with the development, operation or use of a machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) model, tool or system (including any use of the Slate Content for training, fine tuning, or grounding the machine learning or AI system or as part of retrieval-augmented generation); or\n\nproviding archived or cached data sets containing Slate Content to another person or entity.\n\nCopyright and Other Intellectual Property Rights. The Slate Content is protected under the copyright laws of the United States and other countries.

To obtain written consent to use a copyrighted work, please contact us using the information in Section 18. Copying or downloading these materials for anything other than your personal use is a violation of these Terms.\n\nTrade and Service Marks.

Change or Termination\n\nSlate may change or terminate these Terms for any reason at any time. Slate reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to and use of the Services, with or without prior notice. Otherwise applicable sections of the Terms shall survive termination. Slate also reserves the right to seek all remedies available at law and in equity for violations of these Terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Services, including any of the Slate Content.\n\n8. Privacy Policy\n\nBy using the Services, you indicate that you have reviewed and understand the information outlined in our Privacy Policy available here.\n\n9. Links\n\nThe Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by other persons and that are not under the control of or maintained by Slate. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Slate of those other websites or online services, the content displayed therein, or the persons associated therewith. These Terms do not apply to such other websites and online services, and such websites and online services are not part of the Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of these other websites or services.\n\n10. Disclaimer of Warranties\n\nYOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS entirely AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE services, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES OR THE INFORMATION, MATERIALS, GOODS, OR SERVICES APPEARING OR OFFERED ON THE SERVICES or With ReSPECT TO any websites or services linked from the services. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, “with all faults,” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (I) THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, no liens and no encumbrances; (II) THE warranties against infringement, misappropriation or violation of any intellectual property or proprietary rights of any person; (III) WARRANTIES ARISING THROUGH COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE; AND (IV) THE warranties relating to the accuracy, reliability, correctness, or completeness of data or content made available on the SERVICES or otherwise by SLATE. Further, there is no warranty that the SERVICES will meet your needs or requirements or the needs or requirements of any other person OR THE NEEDS OR REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN ANY DOCUMENTATION. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, THAT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE SLATE content, FUNCTIONS OR MATERIALS CONTAINED THEREIN, WILL BE TIMELY, SECURE, ACCURATE, ERROR-FREE, COMPLETE, UP-TO-DATE, FREE OF VIRUSES, OR UNINTERRUPTED. SLATE DOES NOT NECESSARILY ENDORSE, SUPPORT, SANCTION, ENCOURAGE OR AGREE WITH ANY SLATE CONTENT OR ANY USER CONTENT, AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY USER CONTENT OR SLATE CONTENT. SLATE makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use outside of the United States. No oral or written information made available by or on behalf of Slate shall create any warranty.\n\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THESE DISCLAIMERS DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS CLAIMS, OR DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM SLATE’S INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, RECKLESSNESS, FRAUD, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.\n\nIF APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES TO APPLY TO YOU, THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS WILL APPLY TO YOU TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n11. Exclusive Remedy and Limitation of Liability\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NEGLIGENCE, WILL SLATE, its affiliates, or any party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the SERVICES BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION direct, incidental, consequential, indirect, special, or punitive damages AND LOST PROFITS arising out of THE TERMS OR your access, use, misuse, or inability to use the services, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SLATE content OR USER CONTENT, or any Sites LINKED FROM THE SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SLATE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, or in connection with any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, or line or system failure.\n\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY HEREIN, DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM SLATE’S INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, RECKLESSNESS, FRAUD, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.\n\nBecause some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, SLATE’s liability in such jurisdictions shall be limited to the extent permitted by law.\n\nAny claim against us shall be limited to the amount you paid, if any, for use of the Services.\n\n12. Indemnification\n\nYou agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Slate, and its affiliates and licensors, and each of their respective officers, directors, contractors, agents, employees, successors and assigns from and against any and all demands, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, interest, penalties, losses, costs, expenses and harms, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and fees of other professional advisers, arising out of or in connection with (i) your use of the Services (including, without limitation, your User Content and your use of any Slate Content), (ii) your online conduct, (iii) your violation or breach of these Terms, (iv) your failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, (v) your negligence, willful misconduct, or violations of the intellectual property or other rights of any person, or (vi) any of your dealings or transactions with other persons resulting from use of the Services. You shall not settle any such claim without the prior written consent of Slate. These obligations will survive an termination of these Terms.\n\nThis provision does not require you to indemnify us for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Services.\n\n13. Integration and Severability\n\nThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between Slate and you, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us. In the event any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, it will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.\n\n14. No Waiver\n\nOur failure to enforce any provisions of the Terms or respond to a breach by you or other parties shall not in any way waive our right to enforce subsequently any terms or conditions of the Terms or to act with respect to similar breaches.\n\n15. Assignment and Binding Effects\n\nYou must not assign these Terms or any rights or obligations herein without the prior written consent of Slate and any attempted assignment in contravention of this provision is null and void and of no force or effect. Slate has the right to assign these Terms, and any of its rights or obligations herein. These Terms are binding upon each party and its respective successors, heirs, trustees, administrators, executors and permitted assigns.\n\n16. Location, Governing Law\n\nIn any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles. You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a court of competent jurisdiction located in the Commonwealth of Virginia. No software from these Services may be downloaded, exported or re-exported in violation of any law including, without limitation, to countries that are subject to U.S. export restrictions.\n\n17. DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT\n\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY—IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n\nWE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE: You and Slate agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms of Use through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such circumstances we may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.\n\nWHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.\n\nARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms of Use, the rules set forth in these Terms of Use will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. To initiate arbitration, you or we must do the following things:\n\n(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.\n\n(2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111\n\n(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.\n\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to the Commonwealth of Virginia is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in the Commonwealth of Virginia under Virginia law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nAUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Slate, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and these Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.

    "title": "Help! My 60-Year-Old Brother Wants Me to Help Him Find a Girlfriend. But I Don’t Think I Can in Good Conscience.",
    "authors": ["Delia Cai"],
    "raw_text": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy brother, a young 60, talks constantly. I am not exaggerating. I think he has expressed every idea he has ever had. His ex-girlfriend told me he talks himself to sleep. (I did not ask; she volunteered this information.) He told me himself that he was twice dragged offstage when he was running for office because they just needed him to stop talking. Aside from his annoying me for hours every time he visits, I don’t have a problem with his excessive talking, because I love him.\n\nNow, however, he wants help with his love life. He hasn’t had a long-term relationship his entire adult life. Part of it was when he was in the Army and unavailable, but mostly the problem is his inability to just shut up for even a few minutes, let someone else talk, and listen to them. I know I sound harsh, but I can’t imagine what it must be like to be in a relationship with someone who never listens. So what do I say? How do you tell someone that without changing their entire personality, they may not get the relationship they desire? Or how do you get them to redirect the desires to something more likely? The problem is, he is lonely, and I feel sorry for him. I personally don’t care if he changes or not, but I do want him to be happy.\n\n—My Brother’s Keeper\n\nDear Keeper,\n\nI stand by a firm belief that there is truly a pot for every lid, and I can easily imagine a type of person who enjoys a heavy-duty talker. Obviously, that kind of personality isn’t for everyone, so I think your duty as a sibling is to simply encourage your brother to look for compatibility above all other traits (such as income, appearance, etc.) and to be patient about finding someone who’s a good match.\n\nIf he asks you directly for feedback about his dating game, only then can you suggest a few pointers in terms of, say, questions he should be asking or ways to gauge someone’s interest or compatibility. I think otherwise, it’s not your place to give him unsolicited personality tips. But you can encourage him along other nondating avenues to meet people and maybe even find a good outlet. (Talk therapy is great for anyone who’s lonely and has a lot they want to get off their chest; I’m also not entirely kidding when I say that there are a few artistic outlets, like podcasting or emceeing, that he could also channel his mighty capacity into.)\n\nBut if you want to curb some of the talking when he’s with you for the sake of your relationship together, you can provide gentle feedback, such as “Hey, can I take 15 minutes to tell you about [insert thing here]?” or “Bro, I love that you’re a talker, but I want to share some of my stuff with you too because that’s how I want to connect with you.”\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nSomething happened to my brother: I don’t know what it was, and he won’t talk about it. When I left for college, my brother “Tucker” was 16. He was charming, fun, had lots of friends and a string of girlfriends. Tucker played varsity sports and got good grades. He was a little bit of a troublemaker but really fun.\n\nI didn’t come home much that year. I didn’t really pay attention until he came to visit me late the next year. Tucker was withdrawn, couldn’t talk with others, and seemed to have lost a lot of body mass. Everything seemed off. With all the tact of a 20-year-old sibling, I asked him point-blank what was wrong with him, and he angrily went home early.\n\nI brought it up with my parents, but they’ve always been very hands-off, and he was already 18. In college, Tucker got worse. He soared academically, but all his easy charm was gone. He wasn’t active, he barely ate, and he seemed to actively avoid anything that might be fun. Even academics didn’t appear to be enjoyable for him. His then girlfriend drunkenly told me (I didn’t ask) that he was super weird about sex and acted as if they should stop if they were both enjoying it or felt guilty if he came. Massively TMI but also slightly worrying in context. I pushed him to get a depression screening, but campus health said he was fine.\n\nHe’s now 27 and in a postdoc job with actually decent pay. He refuses to get a mattress for his apartment or a warm coat, and he acts as if anything that might make him comfortable or happy is dirty or weak. He’s been hospitalized twice this year for malnutrition-related issues. During his Ph.D. program, he cut out alcohol, then refined sugar, then all but essential sodium. Everything had to be organic, and he continues to narrow his eating to this day around legitimate ethical qualms but also anything enjoyable. It worries me that the hospital visits didn’t make any changes.\n\nHe briefly took up a casual team sport but quit when he was, in his words, “enjoying it too much.” He doesn’t seem to have friendships. Something’s wrong, and it’s making him so unhappy, but I have no idea what it is or how to help. He’s an adult, but no one else is doing anything to help, and I feel guilty for not pushing harder when he was 18.\n\n—Tucker’s Sister\n\nDear Tucker’s Sister,\n\nYou’re definitely right: Something happened to your brother, and it has wrecked his sense of self-worth, along with his relationship with sex, food, and the ability to enjoy his life.\n\nIt’s highly possible that he experienced some kind of violation and is responding in kind by trying to alter his body as a way of coping; for example, it’s not uncommon for victims of sexual abuse to develop disordered eating habits as a way to exert control over their own bodies. I don’t know if this is what happened with your brother per se—it goes without saying that an advice column isn’t the place for a diagnosis—but a sudden switch in personality and behavior like that leads me to think that he definitely experienced some kind of traumatic event.\n\nGive yourself some grace for not having known how to handle this when you were younger. There’s no way to magically badger someone into disclosing a traumatic secret, so there’s no way of knowing if your brother would have chosen to confide in you under any circumstances back then. And that choice may still be immensely difficult for him to make. I think all you can do for now is to try to simply be a consistent, caring presence in his life. Ask him if you can set up a recurring phone call to check in, or a recurring lunch date—you may have to fib a little and say that it’s for your benefit (and not because you’re worried about him). If you’re ever going to find out what happened, I think you have to establish yourself in his life as someone who won’t judge him or push him out of his comfort zone until he’s ready. Build up some trust and connection first. You’ll have to be patient—this might take years.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nIt has always been the family joke that my son would forget his head if it weren’t screwed on. He can be very absent-minded and has lost keys and cellphones, as well as left clothing behind at hotels. It has never been catastrophic, just a quirk. I am very bad with directions, my husband can’t boil water, and my daughter tends to be an overplanner—you get the picture.\n\nWell, my son brought over his girlfriend, “Juliana,” during the holidays. Juliana was mean. She constantly berated my son for the smallest details: He got the wrong brand of eggs at the store, and she treated him like an idiot, constantly “reminding” him. It was very awkward when they had a fight in the entryway that we could all hear. My son shook his key chain and said Juliana didn’t have to treat him like a child. Even if he misplaced his keys, it wasn’t as if they were going to walk out of the house. Juliana snapped that “normal” people don’t have this problem and that my son needed to be examined by a professional.\n\nMy son can be forgetful, like any other fallible human being! He did wonderfully in school and has a great job. There is nothing wrong with him, and I hated hearing how Juliana treated him. She didn’t even bother to tone down her contempt when meeting his family for the first time. My husband tried to talk to our son about this but got the brush-off. I don’t know what to do. My daughter says that if she heard a girlfriend being screamed at like Juliana screamed at her brother, she would stage an intervention. I am deeply worried. What do I do?\n\n—Cannot Forget This\n\nDear Cannot,\n\nIt’s possible that this was a one-time incident and that you caught Juliana on a very bad day during the stressful holiday season. If you’ve already expressed your concerns about that one interaction to your son, that may be all you can do for now.\n\nBut I would keep a close eye on any future visits or interactions with Juliana, as well as any changes to your son’s general disposition or behavior. It’s one thing to have a bratty girlfriend, but it’s another to be stuck in an emotionally abusive relationship in which he’s being constantly berated and belittled. Tread carefully in voicing your displeasure about Juliana with your son: He’s likely going to resist any insinuation that something is wrong, even if it is. Your job is to make yourself available as a gentle source of support whenever he needs it, and to make calm, simple observations, such as “You sound unhappy” or “She isn’t being very nice to you,” when the need arises. Remind him that a little forgetfulness is not a personality defect, and that someone who finds that kind of quirk unbearable may simply be incompatible with the kind and caring person he is.\n\nWant more Prudie?

Sign up for Slate Plus now.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nFor the past six years, my close friend “Steph” and I have been both real friends and industry friends. We’re self-employed creatives, and we share absolutely everything about our businesses (and lives) with each other. Due to personal struggles, my business is NOT doing well at the moment, and Steph’s response has stunned me. I didn’t expect much other than a little sympathy or a pep talk, but she has completely shut down the two or three times I’ve tried to tell her I’m struggling.\n\nWe met up for coffee recently, and she monologued about the luxury niche she’s targeting and whether she would be able to buy a second house in the coming year. I got a little overwhelmed and unexpectedly started to tear up a bit, thinking about how I’m struggling to pay my mortgage. Steph offered me a tissue but didn’t respond at all to my explanation/apology. Instead, she started weeping inexplicably about her stress over her daughter starting active shooter drills at school.\n\nToday I reached out to say that I have COVID again and am worried about missing work. She didn’t have a word for me; instead, she complained about her daughter often getting her sick, then bragged about booking a huge job on short notice. I’m truly happy she’s doing so well, but I’m deeply hurt that she knows how high the stakes are for me but can only seem to talk about herself in response.\n\nI’ve always felt that she was a supportive friend, but the more I think about it, the more I realize she responds only to problems she thinks she can fix and literally ignores the tough stuff that just requires a little empathy. I guess I could think of her as a friend I merely complain about clients with and ask for help only with setting up my email list, but I don’t know. I can’t shake the hurt at being stonewalled when I try to share how down I am. What would you do?\n\n—She Certainly Cries on My Shoulder!\n\nDear Shoulder,\n\nI think you could try talking to Steph and telling her how you feel. Make it clear that you’re not expecting anyone to solve your problems for you and that you just want some reassurance and empathy from her as a friend. But it’s possible she’s simply not good at that and she knows it. Some people are unable to handle other people’s feelings, and there are many reasons for this—maybe she’s insecure about her success because she knows how easily it could disappear, or maybe she’s just not good with her own feelings either. That doesn’t mean you have to write her off completely as a friend, but it may mean you need to downgrade her from “close friend” status to “work friend from whom I get practical advice when I ask for it.”\n\nIn the meantime, seek out new friendships or work on existing ones with people who are much better listeners. It’s possible that Steph feels overwhelmed by her own set of issues or whatever, but what’s clear is that she isn’t the right person (nor should she be the only person) to support you through this stressful stretch of your career.\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nFor a forthcoming advice column, we want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy partner and I have been together for eight years. Although our families are very different, we’ve always gotten along well with everyone. My partner’s mom is generous and well-meaning, but she struggles with boundaries. I’ve managed to build a warm relationship with her while maintaining my comfort level, but recently it’s become more challenging.\n\nShe’s very eager for me to have children and often directs comments about it to me, not her son. Most recently, we discussed a trip to their vacation home, and she was insistent on booking my ticket. I thanked her but explained I’d prefer to book it myself. She ignored my message and continued to book. I gently reiterated and thanked her extensively for the generous offer, but it’s become a point of strife. I think I handled the situation pretty diplomatically. However, my partner is upset and feels that I’m making things unnecessarily difficult. It’s become a huge point of contention, and I feel stuck.\n\nI value my independence and feel uncomfortable accepting the trip under these circumstances, especially since I’m trying to establish boundaries. I explained this to my partner, but he wasn’t receptive and thinks I am being difficult for no reason. I am incredibly hurt by his response and feel some uncertainty about our future if he’s this dismissive and combative of my pretty reasonable (I thought) boundary.\n\nDo you have advice on how to navigate these conversations? I feel really hurt, but if I give in, I’m worried I will harbor resentment against him. This feels like such a cliché that I’m embarrassed it’s even a thing.\n\n—One-Way Ticket\n\nDear One-Way,\n\nDealing with a partner’s family is delicate business. My general rule of thumb is that you should defer to each other on how to handle particular quirks or habits, because there is usually an intricate and storied family culture involved with even small gestures, like booking a plane ticket for a family vacation. So on the issue of the ticket: I think you should accept that your partner’s mother’s desire to pay for it is some complex custom particular to their family, and if your partner says it’s best to go along, then you probably should go with it. (However, you can still make it known to your partner that this isn’t in accordance with what you’d prefer.)\n\nThat said, the pointed comments about children affect you directly, and I think you can raise this as an issue with your partner. Tell her that his mother’s comments make you feel pressured and uncomfortable and that you need him to step up and either help deflect those comments in real time or have a private conversation with his mother about how he doesn’t appreciate anyone crossing that boundary. (He should also make clear that those comments shouldn’t involve only you, since baby-making tends to be a team effort.) The difference here is that, yes, I think you have to go along with someone’s familial customs to an extent, but also, yes, you do have a say in how you’re treated by those same people.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nHow do I stop the lectures? Whenever I spend time with my daughter or her friends (she’s in her 30s) when she hosts get-togethers, I seem to be subjected to lectures on topics ranging from parenting to environmental issues. I find some topics especially loathsome, as I am a recognized expert in the field in which I am being lectured.\n\nI have been surrounded by five of her friends, who proceeded to attempt to bully me into agreeing to their uneducated viewpoint. Any gentle reminders that I am a published author of peer-reviewed papers or assertions that their perspective does not include validated scientific data degenerates immediately to name-calling.\n\nI love a good discussion or debate; however, these “conversations” usually consist of me standing there listening while they expound ad infinitum. My attempts at input are shut down. Do I extract myself immediately when they take a breath for air? I’ve used the “Oh, look at the time” excuse. I’m not looking for recognition, just a change in topic or more relaxed conversation. It would be so nice to talk about the weather.\n\n—Everyone Over 55\n\nDear Over 55,\n\nIt’s time to devise a few conversational escape routes. Experiment with a few go-to phrases to excuse yourself when the lectures start; these don’t even have to make sense to work (such as “Oops, time to feed the cat!” even if you have no pets). There’s no reason you ever have to sit and be subjected to someone’s, much less an entire group’s, harangues if you don’t get a kick out of it. If you’re comfortable with being direct with your daughter, you can simply tell her that you want to spend your time with her bonding over happier subjects and activities, and that these lectures don’t make you feel very connected. Make it clear that if you’d both like such bonding to continue, you need a few boundaries on conversational topics (or at least a time limit!).\n\nAlternatively, when the topic turns to something in your field of expertise, you could also try calling their bluff and devising an in-home debate club if they’re so thirsty for it. Think of yourself as an expert-level MMA fighter who’s being baited into a bar fight. The kind of energy you want to bring to this is: “Oh, we’re not doing this here, but if you’d like to stop by for a real session at my gym, let me know.”\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie",

    "title": "My Boyfriend Insists That We Have an “Equal Partnership.” So Why Am I in Debt Trying to Keep Up With His Lifestyle?",
    "authors": ["Kristin Wong"],
    "raw_text": "Pay Dirt is Slate’s money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Kristin and Ilyce here. (It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nMy partner and I have been in a domestic partnership for several years. We both work full-time and his salary is over three times mine. We opened a joint account when we bought our home five years ago and we both transfer the same amount into it out of every paycheck, and we use this account to pay our mortgage and utilities. I am fine with that because I want to own half of our home. However, after my contributions to the joint account, plus some automated savings, I have enough money left for a certain lifestyle.\n\nMy partner on the other hand is able to save significantly and still afford much more than me, which is great for him, however, the issue is that he is pushing me to follow his lifestyle expectations (high restaurant budget, luxury vacations, expensive home improvement projects). He is generous and will often invite me when we eat out, but I find myself in these challenging situations where I owe him money from various large expenses that we have split 50/50 (e.g. luxury vacation, $200,000 home improvement project). We use an app to keep track of the expenses we pay individually and split them, but my balance keeps increasing, and now I’m looking at turning over to him my full annual bonuses for several years in a row. That is not sustainable (and it’s honestly depressing). I’ve brought up the (not uncommon) idea of splitting expenses other than the mortgage at a rate that would not be 50/50, but he was very opposed to the idea “since we are equal partners.” My current position is to decline every project that is outside of my budget but I anticipate issues in the long run. Is there any other model besides the “not 50/50” split that I could propose as an alternative to bridge our income gap?\n\n—Not 50/50\n\nDear Not 50/50,\n\nYou’re in a tough spot, but your situation is pretty common. Financial inequity is something a lot of couples—and even friends—struggle to navigate. I get where your partner’s thinking is coming from, but being “equal partners” doesn’t always mean splitting everything down the middle. It’s about finding a balance that works for both of you. For example, you could decide to split some household expenses, like the electric bill, down the middle, but then use a sliding scale for discretionary expenses, like groceries, since it sounds like he has more expensive habits. But since splitting things proportionally to income isn’t something he’s open to, maybe suggest a different approach. For example, set a budget for shared expenses like vacations based on an amount you’re both comfortable spending. If he wants to go above that budget, he can cover the extra. If he won’t say, agree to go on a more affordable trip, then you’ll have to put your foot down and tell him you can’t and won’t attend.\n\nBy the way, if he has more expensive habits and expects you to keep up with them, that doesn’t exactly scream “equal partnership,” does it? At the end of the day, this isn’t just about money—it’s about making sure you both feel good about how you’re handling things together. Sit down with him and explain that this financial setup isn’t working for you and that it’s important to find a middle ground that doesn’t leave you stressed or in debt. If it’s a hard conversation, ask if he’s willing to talk to a financial planner to help figure out a system that feels fair for both of you. The bottom line is that you shouldn’t have to overextend yourself just to keep up with your partner’s lifestyle. It’s OK to set boundaries and stick to them, and a good partner will respect that.\n\n—Kristin\n\nClassic Prudie",

Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI live on the top floor of a five story walk up with no elevator. I have a small dog that I need to take out twice a day. I work from home so I get exercise from this. I usually will take the trash out for my elderly neighbors since I am going that direction anyway. All I ask is that they double bag and don’t make each bag too heavy.\n\nWell, my neighbor directly below me had her pregnant granddaughter move in. It hasn’t been great. She has left me more than one nasty note about me “stomping” about. My living room is over her bedroom it seems. I already have carpets down and there isn’t anything more I can do. Anyway, the baby was born and the trash has piled up. I got an even nastier note about the trash when I was sick for several days and couldn’t move around. I felt bad for my neighbor and when I next went out I took a large load. None were double bagged and ended up ripping, so trash and dirty diapers ended up across two floors. I went to the apartment to ask the granddaughter to help me clean up. She told me she couldn’t leave the baby and I was a bitch to ask her. I could see my neighbor beyond the door and she didn’t say a word. I had to get my other neighbors and the maintenance guy to help me clean up the mess.\n\nSince then, I don’t take out that neighbor’s trash. At all. The granddaughter has since moved out, and my neighbor has left me several “nice” notes and even a plate of cookies (I returned them). I can’t return to playing nice neighbor after being treated as trash and her not saying a word. Several of my other neighbors have brought it up and said that she is just an old woman, and I will be one someday so I should have more sympathy. I am this close to stopping taking any trash down but my own. I have always tried to cultivated a live and let live philosophy, but cleaning up someone’s shit is so far over the line it is in another country. Thoughts?\n\n—Taking Out the Trash\n\nDear Taking,\n\nTo be honest, I think it’s unfair of you to blame your neighbor for the actions and rudeness of her granddaughter (who was obviously not at her most selfless, considered state during her pregnancy). I think you should chalk up that whole ordeal to an unfortunate instance of you having to pitch in for the greater good for a little while—I’m going to guess that everyone involved got in over their heads. But now it’s over, and you can reassess how you’d like to conduct your relationship with this neighbor again.\n\nIt may be helpful for you to express to her directly how unappreciated and taken advantage of you felt during that time, which she may or may not be able to apologize for. In any case, you need to evaluate what role you’re comfortable taking on for your elderly neighbors if there’s not typically going to be a “reward” in the form of due appreciation or consideration that you’d want. Is it still worth it to you to help out even if it’s a pain? That’s not a leading question: I think you should genuinely consider whether you’re capable of helping with the trash if it’s only going to make you feel resentful.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think you have to accept the fact that helping others is generally an inconvenient matter, and that this may feel like a pretty lopsided “deal.” Is it worth the trouble simply to feel more connected to your neighbors—or to sustain a relationship with them that you may need to rely on eventually? In my experience, living alone is pretty awesome until it’s not—and I can imagine that it would selfishly be quite helpful to be on good terms with your neighbors, elderly and otherwise, in case of a real emergency.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am lucky to rent a house on a very quiet cul-de-sac. My 12-year-old daughter is the oldest child on the block and has started seriously babysitting for our neighbors after she finished her Red Cross training. Several times, she has babysat up to midnight or later on a Friday or Saturday. The parents always keep me up-to-date on their timing. My daughter is never more than five houses away from home and is very comfortable skipping across the street and letting herself in the house. Everyone has cameras. I stayed up the first several times that she babysat late, but it has never been someone we didn’t know. Now, I am usually asleep when she gets home.\n\nMy favorite summers were when my grandmother threw us out of the house and told us to go explore. Granted, it was the country and not suburbs, but I’d rather cultivate courage and independence in my daughter than anything else. The problem is, when I mention this to other mothers and my peers, people look at me like I am dropping my daughter off on Skid Row. Apparently, I am being “neglectful” and “horrible” for being comfortable falling asleep when my daughter isn’t in the house. I pointed out that my brothers and I often went camping further away from the house at a much younger age and that my grandparents and parents did not worry. And that was before widespread cell phones and security cameras.\n\nThey say it isn’t the same and that my daughter is “too young” or not being paid the “correct” rate. These jobs are consistent and she enjoys the money, while our neighbors enjoy not breaking the bank for date night. She was very proud when she bought her own gaming system this Christmas and Santa brought her the games she wanted. She is saving up for an electric scooter now. What do I say to these people? Several friends have complained that their daughters want to babysit now and they will not let them.\n\n—Baby Sitting Blues\n\nDear Blues,\n\nIt sounds to me that you have a great, trusting relationship with your daughter, and that her babysitting activity falls well within reasonable bounds of safety. Tell these helicopter parents that what works for you and your daughter isn’t going to work for everyone, but that the parenting suggestions box is closed.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nA while ago, I took a second job. There I met Jessica, 15 years my junior; she was bubbly and charismatic and definitely one of those cool girls you want to be friends with. She went out of her way to include me and we became friendly. Cue the pandemic. We finished up work and all left the job. Jessica started her own business and wanted merch. I love helping people, especially with my art. But I always forget that mixing work with friendships ruins everything. Anyway, I designed her logo, and bought and painted a box of hoodies, knowing full well I might never get paid—and I haven’t.\n\nIn the meantime:\n\n1) I made masks during the pandemic, got a bit in over my head (sold over 10,000), and had to figure out how to vertically integrate my family, neighbors, and friends into a “factory” to get them made. We got it all done, but it ruined my mental health.\n\n2) I started IVF a year into COVID, and it made me feel insane. When it worked and I was pregnant, I was not a fun hang. When baby was born, I could barely function. Jessica hated babies and never wanted to be a mom, so I stayed away. I kept waiting and waiting to feel “normal” … my baby is almost 2.\n\n3) I am a pandemic queer. With a lot of time for podcasts and no need to perform my gender, I realized I am non-binary. While working with Jessica, she would never use a non-binary coworker’s correct pronouns, even though my coworker didn’t seem to mind. Jessica’s excuse: All her non-binary friends were fine with not using “they” pronouns. Consequently, I wouldn’t really want to share this part of my life with her.\n\nAt first, Jessica would follow up with me to check in, but she eventually gave up. Well, it’s been 5-ish years now (I’m cringing). Every time I go into my closet, I see her box of custom hoodies and feel shame. I don’t care about getting paid, I’m just not sure if she even still has the business. Should I move on since there are enough compatibility issues? I’m not sure whether to trust my gut, because I get hermit-y, bad at maintaining friendships in general, and consequently don’t have many friends. But I can’t donate her merch knowing she might see someone wearing it someday and hate me (and I can’t destroy it). It feels like I already blew it. What should I do?\n\n—Sweating Over Sweatshirts\n\nDear Sweating,\n\nI think you need to talk to Jessica. Much of your letter makes it sound that you’ve been making certain conclusions about her without giving her a chance to react, explain, or change.\n\nFor example, you don’t actually know for sure that she would be freaked out/annoyed by your baby news, or that she wouldn’t make the effort to use the correct pronouns if you make it clear how important it is to you.\n\nAs far as Jessica knows, you went AWOL on her, professionally and socially. You can’t blame someone for not reading your mind or magically knowing what’s going on in your personal life if you haven’t brought it up, and you certainly can’t use someone’s imagined judgment as reason to avoid them. Fess up to Jessica that your life got very complicated recently, and that you weren’t sure how to address this with her. None of us handled our pandemic and post-pandemic choices as smoothly as we would have liked, and any reasonable person will be sympathetic to your plight. Give her the hoodies (I would let the payment go at this point) and apologize for coming up short as a friend, and then actually give her a chance to respond.\n\nWant more Prudie?

Sign up for Slate Plus now.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy online friend and I have been friends for years, and I really value her friendship and our nightly chats. We’ve talked about meeting in person one day, but it’s more just a vague future possibility than concrete plan. Sometimes, she wants to meet and invites me to visit, then backtracks, not ready to meet in person. This inconsistency has been draining, but I understand her hesitance. We are, after all, internet strangers.\n\nWell, my friend just told me she’s planning to move abroad within the next couple years. I’m trying to be happy and excited—I understand why she’d want to leave the U.S.—but for me, this spells the end of our friendship. She means a lot to me, and a move abroad will end our nightly conversations (because of the time difference), and it will certainly end the possibility of ever meeting in person. I asked her if we could please meet up just once before she moves, and she said no.\n\nMy feelings are hurt. I’ve been holding onto the hope of meeting and looking forward to that for so long, only to have it wither and die right in front of me. How could I talk to her about this without her feeling like I’m dunking on her exciting plans? Or should I just not say anything at all because this move is about her, not me?\n\n—Left Behind\n\nDear Left Behind,\n\nIt sounds like your friendship with this person has been lopsided for quite some time. You’ve communicated your expectations for the friendship (to meet in person) several times, and she has refused you consistently on that front. She has now communicated with you about her future plans that certainly don’t seem to take your friendship into account. No wonder you feel hurt: To me, having several years’ worth of nightly conversations with someone suggests a high degree of intimacy and closeness. Just because this is an online friendship doesn’t mean that anyone is exempt from fundamental standards of consideration that you’d want in any other kind of long-term relationship.\n\nI think you can express your disappointment in a way that addresses the fact that you two clearly have mismatched expectations. Is this friendship more of a matter of convenience for her—does she simply want someone to talk to at night? Or is she committed to making something work (even if it is only online) when she makes the move. Are you willing to settle for purely online interaction for the time being, with the potential that it becomes more infrequent in the future? Once you address these differences, you will have to find out if the two of you can compromise on the shape and form of both your current friendship and for this potential move.\n\nFor starters, is it absolutely true that this friendship will end once she moves several time zones away, or is that just an assumption you’ve made? You need to have a direct conversation about what you both envision will happen once she moves, and what you both would want in order to continue the friendship in a new format. You might find that the two of you can’t come to an agreement on this: For example, if you can’t imagine being happy without in-person meetings, then you might decide that it’s time to move on from this friend. Friendship is all about figuring out what you both need from and can offer each other; when there’s a mismatch and you’re not able to compromise together, you will have to decide if you want to move on entirely from the friendship (for now, at least) or be the person who settles for a little less.\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nFor a forthcoming advice column, we want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am queer and currently share a one-bedroom apartment with my stepbrother. (We tradeoff who sleeps where—this will be relevant in a minute.) Our new neighbor, “Bee,” is lovely, pretty, and very small-town Southern. She loves to bake and knocked on our door around 7 p.m. with fresh bread and introduced herself. Bee comes by every other week with treats. I don’t think she’s lonely, just likes to bake, and she’s good at it.\n\nMy brother’s girlfriend, “Em,” has a chip on her shoulder and is as paranoid as a junkyard dog. Em saw Bee deliver us some sourdough and got her hackles up. She started staying over a lot and hung off my brother if Bee came by.\n\nWell, Em tried to “confront” Bee, and Bee was very confused. Apparently, she had thought my brother and I were a couple, and she got red when I laughed and told her the truth. Then she asked if Em wanted to come over to look at the clothes she was giving away since it was better to give to friends. Em was offended by the offer because Bee is taller and bigger than her. And they aren’t friends? I laughed even more and told Bee I would take her up on her offer. I several nice sweatshirts out of the deal.\n\nEm continues to be pissy, my brother wants me to lay off hanging with Bee, but despite her funny mistake, I like her. She is genuinely sweet and kind and this would be a funny story if Em wasn’t such a sour puss. She doesn’t pay rent, but thinks she has the right to tell me go away in my own apartment. So what should I do? I’d like Bee as a real friend.\n\n—Breaking Bread\n\nDear Breaking,\n\nIt sounds like your current living situation is forcing several of your relationships to become entangled. Your individual relationships with Bee, Em, and your brother should technically all be distinct, but they’ve become muddled into one big mess because of the close proximity you have with each other. If this is simply the reality of your living situation for the time being, you need to get some metaphorical space.\n\nFor example, it’s not your responsibility to broker some kind of understanding or peace agreement between Em and Bee; that’s their business. If either of them talks to you about the other, simply shrug and state that this sounds like something they need to work out. Carry on a friendship with Bee yourself if you’d like, and talk to your brother about some boundaries you both need to set re: how much time Em is at the apartment, and how unacceptable it is for her to tell you to “go away.” If he refuses to set boundaries with Em, you need to seriously evaluate how tenable this living situation is. In the short-term, negotiate with your brother over specific nights where you can trade off having the apartment to yourselves (and maybe communicate that time to Bee, if you’d prefer to have her stop by when your brother and his girlfriend are not around). In the long-term, start looking for a new place.\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nI ended things with my partner recently—we’d been together for a little over a year. I kept noticing toxic behavior over and over again, which were: a lack of trust, trying to catch me in lies that didn’t exist, keeping a close eye on my location constantly, asking where I was/who I was with every time we were apart, and making unsolicited and sometimes hurtful comments about my appearance. I would bring those things up occasionally, but the sense he didn’t trust me was always there. I love this person, and the decision to end things was challenging because we do have a very strong bond. In the time we took apart, which was only two days, we both realized we didn’t want to give up on things. We reconciled, and I promised to work on my own part of the dynamic (fear of being hurt, better communication, etc.). I came to find that in those two days, he had posted bashing commentary on Reddit about me.",

    "raw_text": "How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Jessica and Rich here. It’s anonymous!\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nI was recently having sex with my boyfriend and I was going particularly well—better than usual. He was focusing on me and there was an energy that was really doing it for me.\n\nThen he went from over the underwear to under and it sort of killed it. The friction was great and there was less of it unclothed, but I rolled with it and didn’t say anything. Then, just as I was about to finish or getting close, he stopped and we transitioned to penetration… which is how it always goes! For some reason, it really angered me in the moment, and I kept having sex but was very much not into it. He could tell and asked me why I was quiet. I insisted that everything was fine and that we keep going.\n\nHe finished shortly after and I expressed some of my frustration then. He apologized and asked why I didn’t say anything—that he would’ve been happy to keep focusing on me but wasn’t sure that’s what I wanted this encounter to be. And honestly, even just that short conversation was excruciating! We talk about everything but talking about sex feels so hard and I immediately shut down. I could’ve directed him in the moment to stay on top of the underwear. I also could’ve told him I didn’t want to do penetration or told him not to stop. But I didn’t. I just find it so hard to ask or demand in the moment. How does one get better at that when it feels so impossibly hard?\n\n—Speechless\n\nJessica Stoya: So if I were working with this writer in person, there are a couple of games I would invite them to play. The first one involves trading words back and forth. I usually start with whatever level of explicitness in sexual vocabulary they are comfortable with. It’ll go like this: Say penis. Penis. Say vulva. Vulva. Say pussy. Pussy. OK, say vagina. Vagina. Say testicles. Testicles. How about balls? Balls. Great. You’re doing great. The idea is you escalate until people get comfortable saying all of the words out loud. And at a certain point, once they’re getting confident, I say, “Now you lead. You generate the language we’re using.”\n\nSo first you escalate the intensity of the language and then escalate the responsibility for the language being said. Doing this with the boyfriend probably isn’t going to work right now, but if they have a close friend that they feel really comfortable with, they could ask them to go through that exercise with them. And remember you can always say stop, and say, “This is getting uncomfortable for me. I don’t want to do it anymore.”\n\nRich Juzwiak: Right. The other part of language formation is literacy. So I wonder how much this person has read about sex. How much have they been taught about sex? Because I think the chances of people writing in to us having had decent sex education is probably fairly low. Not to toot our own horn, but to our letter writer: Do you read this column? Do you understand the way that we talk about sex?\n\nJessica: You can read us. You can read Dan Savage’s column.\n\nRich: There are a lot of resources. There are people on Instagram and YouTube. You can read Scarleteen. There are times that I’m writing and I think about my former self and it’s so wild to me that I feel so comfortable talking about this stuff now. I was such a lawful kid, and also being gay in a straight world, the mention of sex would make me uncomfortable. I didn’t have that curiosity going into it. It all just seemed all so forbidden and scary to me. So you can evolve.\n\nThe way to do that is through exposure and talking and finding friends that you can vibe with on this topic. Not necessarily friends that you have sex with, but friends that you can talk about this stuff with. There’s so much that you can do to familiarize yourself and deepen your comfort level here. To me, this letter reads like it’s from somebody who hasn’t had the opportunity to do that. Maybe they don’t know where to start.\n\nJessica: Something else this person can do on their own in the mirror is look themselves in the eyes in the mirror and say out loud, “I have a right to ask for what I want. I deserve the opportunity to voice out loud my preferences.” It’s like a positive affirmation.\n\nRich: Yes.\n\nJessica: If neither of those feels good, pick whatever affirmation works and just spend time, a couple of minutes every day, looking yourself in the eye, saying it, and meaning it. It’s a little bit of a fake it ‘till you feel it situation. Saying it out loud with as much confidence as you can muster tends to eventually result in believing the truth, which is that we don’t all have a right to have what we want necessarily, but we have the right to ask for what we want.\n\nRich: Yes, the pursuit of pleasure. Maybe a pragmatic way to think about this is to really assess the situation and say, “Which is more frustrating here? Is it more frustrating to be made to feel uncomfortable verbalizing this stuff? Or is it more frustrating to not get what I want?” I think the existence of this letter implies that it’s the latter. And sometimes life gives us tough choices and both options kind of suck. You just have to pick the better option, even if it’s still uncomfortable—at least you’re getting to come.\n\nJessica: Also our LW can consider it from the perspective of making the boyfriend a priority. Does our writer think the boyfriend enjoyed not understanding why their partner was quiet? And do we think the boyfriend would prefer that the letter writer express what they want and then be able to choose to give them that? I’m going to say yes. So even if, at this moment, our writer cannot do it for themself, it can be a useful temporary workaround to do it for the people around them.\n\nRich: Exactly. The boyfriend did everything right. It sounds like he was extremely considerate and did the best with what he had in the moment. It seems like he wasn’t getting clear signals and was just trying to do what he could and then after said, “We could have cleared this up if you had spoken up.” So I appreciated that.\n\nAs for the idea that you need to ask or demand in the moment, you don’t have to either. Being immediately on top of it is the best course of action, but maybe you have a conversation before saying, “Let’s just do everything that led up to it last time tonight.” It doesn’t have to be in the moment. You don’t have to say, “Oh no, let’s not move to penetration.” You can establish that intent before going into it, which might make it feel a bit easier.\n\nJessica: If verbalizing things face-to-face is too much, there are so many options. You can text each other. You can sit next to each other looking in the same direction, so you don’t have the pressure of eye contact. You can turn the lights off. You can wait until you’re in bed with the lights off and about to start doing things before saying, “Tonight I’d like to do this.”\n\nRich: It can seem really intimidating in the moment, but you have time to figure it out. You can manage it. You can figure out the least uncomfortable course of action and take that. It really does sound like you have a compassionate boyfriend who would be willing to receive this in whatever form it comes, so take advantage of that.\n\nJessica: This feels like a really great safe space to try the scary thing and practice doing it.\n\nMore Advice From Slate",

    "title": "Slate’s Privacy Policy",
    "raw_text": "Last updated: July 8, 2024\n\nThe Slate Group LLC (“Slate,” “we,” or “us”) is committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual needs. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information through the websites, mobile applications, and other online services and products that link to or post this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”). Please read the entire Privacy Policy before using our Services. By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.\n\nWe may sell or share your Personal Information as further described below.\n\nIf you are located in the United States, including in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Virginia or Utah, and would like to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information click here, the button below, or email us at privacy@slate.com.\n\nPlease see Your State Privacy Rights for more information on how we respond to consumer requests.\n\nYou do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use and retain personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.\n\n1. Information Collection\n\nA. Information You Provide.\n\nWe collect personal information from you when you use the Services. “Personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\n\n• Contact information, such as name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number;\n\n• User name, display name, and password;\n\n• Demographic information, such as age, race, and gender;\n\n• Payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date, through a third-party payment processor*;\n\n• Communications preferences;\n\n• Search queries;\n\n• Stories, comments, photos, and other information posted in our interactive online features;\n\n• Correspondence and other information that you send to us; and\n\n• Additional information as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.\n\n*If you use the Site to make purchases, we will also collect certain payment information, such as payment card, PayPal, Square, or other financial account information, and billing address. A third-party payment processor collects that information; we do not store your credit card information.\n\nPersonal Information once “de-identified” is not subject to this Privacy Policy and we may treat it as non-Personal Information and use it without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law.\n\nB. Information Automatically Collected.\n\nWe also collect certain information automatically when you visit the Services (“Usage Information”), including:\n\n• Your browser type and operating system;\n\n• Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;\n\n• Geolocation information, including precise information;\n\n• Transaction data on items you purchase on our site or through our partners;\n\n• Other unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers;\n\n• Sites or mobile apps you used before and after using the Services;\n\n• Pages you view and links you click on within the Services;\n\n• Information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies;\n\n• Information about your interactions with e-mail messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and\n\n• Standard Server Log Information.\n\nWe may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to automatically collect Usage Information:\n\no Cookies and Pixel Tags\n\nCookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser. You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online products, services or features on the Services.\n\nPixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device.\n\no Embedded Scripts\n\nAn embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.\n\no Location-identifying Technologies\n\nGPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location, understanding the geographic distribution of our users, and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location.\n\no Device Fingerprinting\n\nDevice fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications.\n\no In-App Tracking Methods\n\nThere are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps. You can stop all collection of information via our mobile applications by uninstalling them. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device and/or Slate’s iOS or Android mobile applications.\n\nFor further information on tracking technologies and your choices regarding them, please see Section 6 below.\n\no Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.\n\nWe allow outside entities to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information through the Services. For example, our vendors may use these technologies to collect information (i) that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics, and (ii) that is used to serve advertisements on our Services and across the Internet and on other apps tailored to your apparent interests. To the extent we combine information from outside services with Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Services, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, the information collected and stored by outside entities remains subject to their policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on third party services.\n\nWe use various analytics services that may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the website, compile reports on the website’s activity, and provide other services related to website activity and usage. These technologies may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The information generated by these providers will be transmitted to and stored by them and will be subject to their privacy policies. For a full list of third party partners with links to their privacy policies and opt-out options, including analytics services, see our Third Party Partners page.\n\nYou may choose whether to receive interest-based advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. You can also opt out of interest-based advertising within mobile apps based on advertising identifiers on your device (for example, through cross-app tracking). See the Advertising and Privacy options under your device’s Settings for more information. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of interest-based advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Slate is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.\n\nChoices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information and Do Not Track Disclosures.\n\nSome web browsers may transmit signals such as “do-not-track” (DNT) or Global Privacy Control (GPC) to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear (especially with DNT), whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Slate will endeavor to take action in response to these signals.\n\nGlobally, Slate will interpret the browser “do-not-track” signal as an opt-out signal of the Sale of Personal Information to the US Privacy API. For more information on “do-not-track” and Global Privacy Control, visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com and https://globalprivacycontrol.org/.\n\nResidents of the United Statues, including in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia or Utah may have additional personal information rights and choices. Please see Your State Privacy Rights for more information. To exercise this right, please visit our “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” webpage.\n\nC.

To the extent we combine such information from outside sources with Personal Information we have collected about you on the Services, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by outside sources.\n\n2.

The categories of service providers with whom we share information and the services they provide are described in our Privacy Policy.\n\nWe disclose your personal information to service providers who perform services and functions on our behalf. When we disclose personal information to our service providers, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except for fulfilling requirements and services being performed under contract.\n\nExercising Your Rights\n\nThe CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes those rights and explains how to exercise those rights.\n\nYou may exercise your California rights by emailing a verifiable consumer request to privacy@slate.com, or you may use this form to request deletion of your information.\n\nYou are not required to create an account with us in order to submit a verifiable consumer request. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.\n\nWe will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.\n\nRequest to Access Your Personal Information\n\nYou have the right to request access to personal information collected about you and information regarding the source of that information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we share it. To protect our customers’ personal information, we are required to verify your identity before we can act on your request.\n\nAs part of our verification process of your request we ensure reasonable measures are in place to detect fraudulent requests and prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. We are required to verify your identity, and the identity of your authorized agent, if the request is submitted via an agent by associating the information provided in the request to any personal information previously collected by us or use a third-party identity verification service.\n\nWe will disclose the following information to you upon receiving your verifiable request:\n\n• The categories of personal information we collected about you.\n\n• Specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.\n\n• The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.\n\n• Our business purpose for collecting that personal information.\n\n• The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.\n\n• The categories of personal information that were disclosed or sold to third parties.\n\n• Our business or commercial purpose for selling or disclosing the personal information, if applicable.\n\nRequests to Delete Your Personal Information (Right to Request Deletion)\n\nYou have the right to request in certain circumstances that we delete any of your personal information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. You may submit such a request as described below. To protect our customers’ personal information, we are required to verify your identify before we can act on your request. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with your request, or why we may comply with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.\n\nSubmitting Request to Know or Delete\n\nTo exercise the rights described above, you can contact us by submitting your request by:\n\n• Send an email to privacy@slate.com\n\n• Submit your request online using this form\n\nOnly you or your authorized agent may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf, we may require that you (1) provide the authorized agent written permission to do so, and (2) provide a copy of the authorization or provide a copy of a power of attorney that complies with California Probate Code so that we can verify the identity of the authorized agent.\n\nIn verifying requests, we employ reasonable measures to detect fraudulent requests and prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. To meet our obligations, we are required to verify your identity, and the identity of your authorized agent, if the request is submitted via an agent, by associating the information provided in your request to personal information previously collected by us.\n\nIf we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity on or from the password-protected account, we may decline a request or request that you provide further verifying information.\n\nWe will not require you to create an account with us in order to make a request. We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.\n\nResponse Timing and Format\n\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:\n\n• Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.\n\n• Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\n\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\n\nFor all verifiable consumer requests, we will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at privacy@slate.com.\n\nWe endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt, though we will respond to sales opt-out requests withing fifteen (15) days of receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\n\nIf you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.\n\nAny disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.\n\nFor data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.\n\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\n\nRight to Opt Out of the Sale of Personal Information to Third Parties\n\nYou have the right to opt out of any sale of your personal information to third parties.\n\nTo exercise this right, please visit our “Do Not Share or Sell My Personal Information” page. Please note that your right to opt out does not apply to our sharing of personal information with service providers, who are parties we engage to perform a function on our behalf and are contractually obligated to use the personal information only for that function.\n\nOther California Privacy Rights\n\nPursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who provide us with personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us, one time per calendar year, information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses.\n\nIf you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address: privacy@slate.com or write to us at the following mailing address:\n\nThe Slate Group, LLC\n\n15 MetroTech Center, 8th Floor\n\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\n\nEmail: privacy@slate.com\n\nYou must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address.

    "title": "I Gave My Nephews Christmas Presents Based on “Merit.” What a Disaster.",
    "authors": ["Nicole Chung"],
    "raw_text": "Slate Plus members get more Care and Feeding every week. Have a question about kids, parenting, or family life? Submit it here!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI have two nephews, aged 17 and 19. One is polite and engaging and chooses to spend time with the preceding generations. The other prefers his video games and his virtual friends, and when he does talk to us, can’t resist saying the most offensive things, just to get a reaction. One acknowledges gifts appropriately. The other tears the paper and tosses the contents aside while reaching for the next one.\n\nAt Christmas, we gave both boys gifts of equal monetary value. Later, privately, I also gave the nice kid a couple of extra things—things I knew he would like, because he talks to me. The rude one found out and confronted me. I told him yes, I did give a few special items to his brother, because his brother had let me get to know him. I told him that if I knew him better—if he ever talked to me—I would have a better idea of things that would make him happy. He said “money makes me happy.” I said “then I suggest you get a job.” He stormed off.\n\nNow he is refusing to come to an annual family event because “everyone likes his brother better.” My parents are likely in their final years, and the family really should be together. We’ve all gotten along really well, across generations and across nuclear families, my whole life. My nephew is the first challenge we’ve faced to our normal pleasant relationships. No one’s mad at me—he’s a legal adult and no one in our family is into strong-arming others, but I do feel like my actions precipitated his tantrum and like this might be my problem to fix. Is there an opportunity here for me, or anyone, to pursue the case and gently bring him around to the idea that relationships, and all the good they bring, entail a little effort? Failing that, magic words to get him to grow up, even temporarily, for the sake of his grandparents? I can’t make him want something he doesn’t value; I definitely do not want to fall all over myself placating the little snot.\n\n—Armistice Aunt\n\nDear Armistice Aunt,\n\nAre there valuable lessons for your nephew to learn? Sure. And I truly hope he does. But there are several reasons why I doubt you’re going to be the one who turns his whole life around: 1) He is an adult; 2) you aren’t his parent; 3) he’s pretty pissed at you now; 4) and most crucially, you don’t actually seem to care about him as a person.\n\nYou have written him off as a “little snot.” He may well be! Or maybe he’s a teenager and there’s something else going on in his life that you don’t know about. In any case, it’s hard enough to influence or guide someone in a positive direction when you’re doing it for their sake. If you don’t actually care about them and you’re doing it for other reasons, they can usually tell. Your nephew is well aware that you like his brother and don’t like him much. You are only interested in his situation and behavior because of how it’s affecting your parents. I’m just not sure that he would be motivated to listen to a lecture from you, however well-meaning.\n\nYou said it yourself: You can’t make him want something he doesn’t. Wherever his behavior comes from, you aren’t responsible for trying to change it, and it doesn’t sound like you’re the most likely or qualified person to do so just because you’re also the one who recently set him off. I’m not saying your relationship (or lack thereof) with him is your fault; I’m just saying that without genuine regard on either side, there isn’t much of a foundation for you to work with him in a meaningful way or get him to become a kinder person or “grow up.” Give him some time to cool off—he might return to family gatherings once he does—and let his own parents attempt to parent him, if anyone does.\n\n—Nicole\n\nMore Advice From Slate",

    "title": "Freida McFadden’s best book: How do readers even tell these cookie",
    "authors": ["Laura Miller"],
    "raw_text": "The world of Freida McFadden’s thrillers is full of people and lives that at first seem “perfect”: rich and “devastatingly handsome” husbands, their well-groomed and “achingly beautiful” wives, enormous penthouses and mansions. Also, leather sofas. So many leather sofas! McFadden’s best-known novel, The Housemaid, begins with an unidentified narrator wondering if the police detective heading upstairs to find a gruesome scene in the attic has taken a moment to envy the swank “burnt-caramel Italian leather” sofa on which she sits.\n\nOnce you get the hang of McFadden’s formula, you’ll realize that the person narrating that opening scene is almost never the novel’s heroine, the person who will narrate most of the rest of the book. McFadden—the pseudonym of a Boston physician—has sold more than 6 million copies of her 23 thrillers, beginning as a self-publisher before turning over that task to the independent publishing house SourceBooks, so she’s got it down. To set the hook, McFadden’s thrillers typically begin in carnage, with a corpse, an arrest, a killer creeping toward the narrator in the dark. Then they roll back to the beginning of the story, a few days or weeks or months earlier, to explain how something so grisly and dramatic could have happened to a person who is either utterly ordinary (a maid, a high school teacher, a nurse) or else apparently “perfect.” In either case, the novel’s heroine will also have a big secret that she’ll allude to darkly for many chapters before finally spilling the beans.\n\nAs with any very successful slice of pop culture, it’s tempting to read a lot of social significance into the success of McFadden’s thrillers. Whether they will bear much scrutiny is another matter. Unlike, say, Colleen Hoover, a bestseller-list juggernaut who crams every conceivable crowd-pleasing device into her novels, McFadden doesn’t do “spice” or jerk tears. You won’t find her enthusiasts—who, according to the New York Times, call themselves “McFans”—posting TikTok videos of themselves weeping or fanning their smut-flushed faces with one of her books. Instead, they record themselves gaping at one of her novel’s last few pages in astonishment. As an author, McFadden really only does one thing: She’s a twist machine.\n\nMachine is the operative term, because McFadden cranks out novels—each uncannily close to 350 pages in length—with the efficiency of a factory. (While also, somehow, still working as a doctor treating brain disorders.) In addition to her latest, The Crash, which was released this week, she’ll be publishing The Tenant in May. After that, who knows? The year will still be young. Unsurprisingly, McFadden books feel more engineered than written, with surfaces as smooth and featureless as the fancy stainless steel appliances in her rich baddies’ kitchens. Her fiction has no atmosphere, no images, no texture. Even when her characters—who are almost always blond—have a backstory, it’s insubstantial. At the beginning of The Housemaid, Millie, the title character, is a few months out after serving a 10-year prison sentence. Yet, despite prison being what most of us consider a fairly memorable experience, she never mentions a single recollection from the preceding decade: no one she met inside, no skills learned, nothing of what it was like to be confined, not even the food. Her past is a vacuum.\n\nOr, rather, it’s a device. Millie’s record, and the difficulty she has finding employment because of it, forces her to stick with a job anyone else would quit within a week. She works as a live-in housekeeper for the Winchesters, a fabulously rich Long Island family. Nina Winchester is impossible and unstable, blaming Millie for messes Nina has made herself, accusing her of nonsensical transgressions and running down her work. By contrast, Nina’s husband, Andrew, is handsome and kind, stepping in to help Millie out whenever Nina’s demands get too onerous.\n\nOne rule of thumb with McFadden’s thrillers: Everyone turns out to be the opposite of what the author initially leads you to believe they are. (Be forewarned: The following will contain spoilers.) Nina isn’t jealous of Millie’s growing attraction to Andrew; she’s actually trying to palm her husband off on the maid because he’s a controlling sadist who periodically locks her in a room without food or water. Conversely, in that novel’s sequel The Housemaid’s Secret, Millie tries to rescue an abused wife, but the woman is actually conniving to trick Millie into killing her rich (and utterly blameless) husband before he gives all their money to charity and divorces her. Vulnerable invalids are in fact sinister manipulators, while chirpy brides and best friends are revealed to be sociopathic murderers.\n\nThe Crash, McFadden’s new novel, abides by this rule, delivering a midbook twist that the practiced McFadden reader can see coming a mile away, and a preposterous late-book twist that feels especially gratuitous. The main character—eight months pregnant by one of the many evil, heartless rich people who stalk McFadden’s fiction—is rescued from a car accident in a blizzard by a couple who stash her in a hospital bed in their basement. She thinks the husband is abusive and behind the wife’s reluctance to transport her to a hospital, but in fact the wife, driven mad by her own inability to conceive a child, plans to deliver, then steal, the baby. When the heroine finally escapes with the aid of the husband, she learns from the police that someone had tampered with her car. This turns out to be her own brother, a minor character who has only ever seemed deeply concerned for her, until he is caught again trying to kill her so that he can do a business deal with the evil rich guy who fathered her child.\n\nEvery time I see someone on TikTok presenting a stack of a dozen McFadden novels she’s read and offering to rank them for the viewer, I wonder how she did it. How did she not get bored by fiction whose only purpose is to trick you into being surprised at the end—fiction that gets less and less surprising the more of it you read? Unlike the clever, elaborate puzzles devised by, say, Agatha Christie, McFadden’s thrillers are so bare-bones she can’t afford much in the way of red herrings or misdirection. The good guys are the bad guys, and the bad guys are the good guys. Obviously, both of the dewy newlyweds stranded in a big old Westchester mansion that once belonged to a famous therapist will turn out to be her former patients, and homicidal ones at that.\n\nTrue, McFadden doesn’t seem to command the same passionate loyalty that Hoover does. Even those who profess to enjoy her books tend to qualify their enthusiasm. “Her books are like Lifetime movies. It’s just a guilty pleasure,” one Redditor posted, almost apologetically, in a McFadden thread replete with ambivalence about her thrillers. Others have complained that McFadden’s books are “plagiarized”—by which they don’t mean the traditional definition of the term, a word-for-word presentation of another writer’s work as one’s own. Instead, these readers believe that McFadden has lifted her premises and twists from other books: The Housemaid turns on a device close to that of Liv Constantine’s The Last Mrs. Parrish, while McFadden’s The Teacher too nearly resembles Kate Elizabeth Russell’s My Dark Vanessa, and McFadden’s The Wife Upstairs seems like a rip-off of Colleen Hoover’s Verity (which itself, in my opinion at least, seems overly indebted to Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl).\n\nThese complaints, though, are less about McFadden’s work in particular and more the symptoms of a genre, the domestic thriller, reaching a stage of creative exhaustion. There are only so many ways that husbands and other family members can deceive and double-cross the heroines of such stories. In McFadden’s thrillers, these familiar devices get regurgitated, capitalizing on a readership whose obsession with perfect facades—that is, with a flawless performance of conventional femininity—is matched only by its desire to see that performance ripped up and proven a lie. One day, perhaps, readers will finally lose their appetite for this particular flavor of schadenfreude. But until they do, McFadden will never tire of serving it to them.",

    "summary": "To set the hook, McFadden’s thrillers typically begin in carnage, with a corpse, an arrest, a killer creeping toward the narrator in the dark.\nAs with any very successful slice of pop culture, it’s tempting to read a lot of social significance into the success of McFadden’s thrillers.\nOne rule of thumb with McFadden’s thrillers: Everyone turns out to be the opposite of what the author initially leads you to believe they are.\nUnlike the clever, elaborate puzzles devised by, say, Agatha Christie, McFadden’s thrillers are so bare-bones she can’t afford much in the way of red herrings or misdirection.\nOthers have complained that McFadden’s books are “plagiarized”—by which they don’t mean the traditional definition of the term, a word-for-word presentation of another writer’s work as one’s own.",

    "title": "The Figure Skaters Whose Promising Careers Were Cut Tragically Short on Wednesday",
    "authors": ["Chris Schleicher"],
    "raw_text": "On Wednesday night, American Airlines Flight 5342 collided with a U.S. Army helicopter and crashed into the Potomac River near Washington. Officials believe there are no survivors from either craft. Among those on the plane were figure skaters, their families, and coaches returning from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas. Many of these skaters were rising stars participating in the National Development Camp, a “three-day educational training program to accelerate their exposure to High Performance Programs.” These were not the skaters one would be seeing at next year’s Olympics in Milan; these were likely the skaters one would be seeing in 2030 and beyond, a generation snuffed out before getting to step onto the world stage.\n\nAmong the skaters confirmed to have been on Flight 5342 are:\n\nJinna Han\n\nSpencer Lane\n\nEdward Zhou\n\nEverly Livingston\n\nAlydia Livingston\n\nFranco Aparicio\n\nSean Kay\n\nAngela Yang\n\nAlso aboard the flight were many family members of these skaters, vital support systems for any young athlete. The aforementioned skaters were at the juvenile, intermediate, and novice levels of the sport, the tiers right below junior and senior (the latter of which is the Olympic level). Watching footage of these skaters’ recent performances this morning, I was struck as I recalled how explosive this period of growth is in a skater’s career. The increase in athletic ability is exponential at this point, almost too much for their bodies to handle, as you watch them white-knuckle it to hang on to freshly conquered jumps and embrace their coaches as they achieve new personal best scores. To have their careers cut short at this moment in their development is especially devastating.\n\nOne such example of a rapidly progressing skater lost on this flight is Spencer Lane, who had recently won gold in Intermediate Men at the U.S. Eastern Sectional championships. On his Instagram account, he posted one day ago: “I am so happy to have qualified for national development camp earlier in november, it has been my goal almost ever since I became aware that it was a thing. I learned so much new information that i can apply to my everyday life, and met so many amazing people! … Thank you @usfigureskating and the local organizing committee for making everything happen, and lastly, huge thank you to all the amazing friends, coaches, and faculty that i have met over the last week, it was such an amazing experience.” In a heartbreaking reminder of how quickly this young talent was progressing, he recently posted a video montage on Instagram, showing him landing a single jump in December 2022, a double-double combination in December 2023, and a triple-triple combination in December 2024. “Adding a revolution every year! Hope the pattern continues!” Tragically, we will never know how far he would have advanced by December 2025.\n\nOn the shared Instagram account of Everly and Alydia Livingston, their most recent post shows them standing by the ice at Nationals, with this caption: “We were born ready for this but is @usfigureskating ready for this much Livingston at Nationals?” Everly had recently placed fourth in Intermediate Women at the Eastern Sectional. Alydia had announced a new ice dance partnership one week ago.\n\nIn addition to the skaters lost on this flight, several coaches were also aboard. Inna Volyanskaya was a coach at the Ashburn Ice House in Ashburn, Virginia, and was formerly a pair skater for the Soviet Union, winning the gold medal at the 1982 Nebelhorn Trophy. Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova were coaches at the Skating Club of Boston, two-time Olympians, and gold medalists at the 1994 world championships in pairs. They were also the parents of Maxim Naumov, who just finished fourth at this year’s nationals in the senior men’s event, making the team for the Four Continents championships in February.\n\nAs a former figure skater myself, the heartbreaking news of the plane crash hit me especially hard, but it also felt all too familiar. After the initial processing of the disaster, my first thought was, Oh my God, not again. U.S. Figure Skating has endured tragedy like this before. And in a sport as tight-knit as this, the loss of any of our members echoes far and wide.\n\nIn my living room, I have a framed Sports Illustrated cover of a smiling skater in a red dress gliding across a pond. The girl is 16-year-old Laurence Owen, and the pond she is skating on is in my hometown of Winchester, Massachusetts. At the time the photo was taken, Laurence had just won the gold medal at the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Colorado Springs. Two days after Sports Illustrated published the cover, Laurence and the entire U.S. figure skating team were tragically killed in a plane crash on their way to the world championships in Prague. Among those on the plane were Laurence’s sister, Maribel Owen, who had recently captured the pairs title at Nationals, and their mother/coach, Maribel-Vinson Owen, a nine-time U.S. national champion in her own right. In my hometown, Vinson-Owen Elementary School is named in their memory. I remember growing up and driving by that school, seeing the two pristine white skates on the sign out front. It felt special to be from a town with such a figure skating legacy, but it was also a harrowing story to hear at a young age.\n\nThe crash of Sabena Flight 548 killed all 18 members of the 1961 U.S. World Figure Skating team and 16 others accompanying them, including family, coaches, and skating officials. In an instant, America’s elite level of figure skating vanished, along with decades of figure skating expertise. To this day, U.S. Figure Skating has a mandate that no team traveling to an international competition is permitted to fly together. With a sudden vacuum at the top of the sport, it would take years for U.S. Figure Skating to recover. At the 1962 U.S. championships, Barbara Roles won the ladies competition after feeling obligated to return from retirement less than a year after giving birth to her first child. Scott Allen won the silver medal in the men’s event at just 12 years old, a shocking example of how thin the field was after the tragedy.\n\nWhen I was an up-and-coming pairs figure skater with my sister, Molly, we traveled to Connecticut to train with Vadim Naumov, one of the coaches lost on Wednesday’s flight. I can still remember how rapidly he helped us progress in our lifting technique and how much confidence we gained from the experience. I felt privileged to be receiving knowledge from a world champion.\n\nOur sport is a very small one, and thus figure skating is a flame that must be kept alive and passed down from generation to generation, almost an oral tradition. While the 1961 plane crash set back U.S. Figure Skating for many years, the knowledge of those skaters was never truly lost. Indeed, those athletes and coaches still exert an influence on skating today. For instance, Maribel Vinson-Owen was a coach of Frank Carroll, who in turn became coach to Olympians Evan Lysacek and Michelle Kwan, who would tie Maribel’s record for most U.S. national titles. Kwan and Lysacek in turn inspired many of the young skaters of today. Even I was affected indirectly by the legacy of the 1961 crash. U.S. Figure Skating created the Memorial Fund, “a living legacy to the lives lost on that fateful day in 1961, which helps skaters reach their skating and academic goals.” During my career, I was a beneficiary of the fund, which helped my family afford the expenses of putting two children through the sport. In a way, it felt as if the Vinson-Owen legacy were pushing me forward from all those decades in the past—one Winchester figure skating family helping another.\n\nAs I write this, I look at the Laurence Owen Sports Illustrated cover on my wall and mourn the lives lost senselessly, then and now. But right next to that picture, I have another framed Sports Illustrated cover from 1968. Within that frame, I see another graceful young girl on the ice in Grenoble, France, wearing a long-sleeved chartreuse dress. Above her it reads, “U.S. Olympic Champion Peggy Fleming.” A mere seven years after the 1961 crash, the U.S. regained the gold medal in the women’s event, a testament to the resilience of our skating community. These pictures, side by side on my wall, are a reminder of how quickly dreams can be taken away from us and the grit and determination that it takes to rebuild after a loss.\n\nUnlike the 1961 crash, which eliminated the very top level of skaters in the U.S., the 2025 crash will have an impact that we won’t see immediately. Our world and Olympic rosters will not be affected right away. But one must mourn all the future champions and future coaches lost, bright lights extinguished too soon. My heart breaks thinking of all the promise unfulfilled by these skaters just starting out on their journeys, links in a chain of knowledge going back to the origins of the sport. The U.S. Figure Skating Memorial Fund states that its goal is to “secure our future by honoring our past.” Looking back to that past can help us now, and in the future. Just as we have before, we will mourn, we will remember, then we will get back on the ice. Skaters are resilient by nature; after every fall, we rise again.",

    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on antisemitism. A White House fact sheet, obtained by reporters ahead of the order, proclaimed that “Immediate action will be taken by the Department of Justice to protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.” Trump also vowed, “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.”\n\nIn other words, Trump’s plan to fight antisemitism is to use the powers of the U.S. government to go after universities, and to deport people, including students, who are here on visas if the protests in which they are participating are deemed to be sympathetic to Hamas.\n\nDemocrats who speak out against this may well be accused of antisemitism, supporting terrorism, or being soft on national security. They need to speak and act out against it anyway.\n\nWe have, unfortunately, seen that this is a tall order for many. We have seen that some Democrats were all too ready to rush to paint universities as hotbeds of antisemitism; to back legislation that would give the executive branch the power to go after nonprofits by describing them as supportive of terrorism (a term that, as we have seen in the United States and around the world, is all too open to political manipulation); and to falsely condemn peaceful protesters as violent.\n\nThat needs to change. It’s not only students who are under threat. The president is conducting an all-out assault on liberal democracy—what Perry Bacon Jr. at the Washington Post called “a full-scale war against modern liberalism,” freezing federal funding, halting foreign aid, further restricting immigration, halting initiatives to promote diversity and accessibility, and attacking transgender rights. This executive order, in its attack on institutions of higher learning and on the constitutional right to free assembly, needs to be understood in that context. You don’t support liberal democracy if you also support the Trump administration’s crackdown on universities and his planned deportation of students, and if you do support the latter, you may find that you soon no longer have the luxury of living in the former.\n\nAll of this would be true even if the administration appeared sincere in its desire to fight antisemitism. Unfortunately, it seems open to doing this only insofar as “fighting antisemitism” means “going after critics of Israel, particularly on college campuses,” and not if it involves, say, “addressing the rampant antisemitic conspiracy theories within our own building.”\n\nDuring Trump’s first week in office, Elon Musk, his head of “government efficiency” who has joined the president at various meetings with foreign leaders, twice performed what looked an awful lot like a Nazi salute at a victory rally while thanking voters for saving civilization; dashed off some Nazi puns on X, his social media platform; and told supporters at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party that Germans should move beyond guilt about their past.\n\nFurther, while Trump did not comment this week on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, his Defense Intelligence Agency did reportedly circulate a memo saying that observance for May’s Day of Remembrance would be paused, along with those for things like Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Black History Month, and Women’s Equality Day. Wednesday and Thursday saw hearings for his health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who, in 2023, suggested that COVID was engineered to spare Ashkenazi Jews (along with Chinese people). This is before we get to the president himself, who has repeatedly pushed conspiracies about George Soros, the Jewish Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist, and has said that there is something wrong with Jews who do not support him politically. In his first week in office, Trump also pardoned accused white supremacists and antisemites, including members of the neofascist Proud Boys, who were involved in storming the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAll this is to say that the president is not threatening college students to actually fight the very real problem of antisemitism or to protect Jews. He is using Jewish fear and the threat of antisemitism to attack civil rights, minorities, and democracy itself while allowing antisemitism in his own administration to fester. Jewish groups have spoken out against the executive order, including the anti-occupation group IfNotNow, progressive Jewish group Bend the Arc, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, and Nexus, which works to combat antisemitism and protect free speech (and with which, disclosure, I work as a fellow; it had no oversight on this piece). These groups have, accurately, called the order not only counterproductive to the fight against antisemitism—which will be won through education and working across difference and not by deporting students—but also antidemocratic. It’s good that they have said something.\n\nBut everyone should. Everyone, and particularly every elected Democrat, should work and speak out against Trump’s plans even if they don’t agree with everything, or even anything, that Jewish Voice for Peace or Students for Justice in Palestine says. They should speak out even if they don’t think it’s fair that students protest against Israel and not, say, Russia and China, or if they think it’s wrong to encourage boycotts of Israeli goods or cultural products, or if they don’t believe that there are interpretations of “from the river to the sea” that are not antisemitic.\n\nThey should do so—they need to do so—because the point of having free speech and assembly as constitutional guarantees isn’t to ensure that only people who agree with you can speak out and assemble. Nor is the point of higher education to learn only what you want to know. Politicians and ordinary Americans must oppose this action because if the people with whom you disagree don’t have the right to speak out against government policy without fear of retribution from the most powerful people in the country, that right no longer exists.\n\nAnd so I hope that every Democrat speaks out for these universities, these professors, these students. They should do so even when it gets hard and politically uncomfortable. And they should remember that when you speak out for someone else’s right to protest without fear of political persecution in a democracy, you’re not only doing it for them. You’re doing it for yourself.",

    "authors": ["Fred Kaplan"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nIf Thursday’s confirmation hearing is anything to go by, Tulsi Gabbard may well become President Trump’s first Cabinet nominee to get voted down by the Senate.\n\nIt was a disastrous audition for the post of director of national intelligence, as all of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s eight Democrats and a few of its nine Republicans raised serious questions about her judgment, her qualifications, and her ability to develop trust with the 18 U.S. intelligence agencies that she would oversee and with their counterparts in allied nations.\n\nFrom the get-go, Gabbard’s nomination to be the top U.S. intelligence official has struck many as the most startling in a string of startling nominations. Many of these nominees seem well suited to weaken the departments or agencies that they would head—or, to put it in terms that Donald Trump and his entourage have invoked on many occasions, the sort of people who would, deliberately or by dint of their incompetence, help dismantle the “deep state.”\n\nGabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who turned MAGA enthusiast after a failed 2020 run for the presidency, has made waves in recent years for parroting Kremlin propaganda on the Russia–Ukraine war, for defending Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad (by disputing intelligence findings that he was behind specific chemical weapons attacks on his own people and by claiming that the rebel groups he bombed and strafed were all al-Qaida fighters), and for making various other bizarre claims.\n\nWhen Trump announced her nomination, the anchors on Russia TV—the Kremlin-run news channel—greeted the news with glee, hailing Gabbard as “our girlfriend.”\n\nSeveral senators noted all of these facts at Thursday’s hearing but focused still more intensely on other matters. Nearly all of them noted that she had once hailed Edward Snowden as a “brave whistleblower” who should be pardoned for all criminal offenses. Snowden was the National Security Agency contractor who stole 1.5 million highly classified documents, leaked some of them to reporters, then fled to Moscow, where he still lives as a Russian citizen.\n\nGabbard replied that she had only meant to highlight the “egregiously illegal and unconstitutional programs” that Snowden had exposed—specifically NSA programs that intercepted communications of U.S. citizens—and that his leaks had led to “serious reforms.”\n\nA few senators quoted from a bipartisan House Intelligence Committee report calling Snowden’s actions “the largest, most damaging intelligence leak” in U.S. history and concluding that the vast majority of his stolen documents had nothing to do with Americans’ privacy. Rather, they revealed extensive details on intelligence “sources and methods,” doing great, lasting harm to U.S. security—and to U.S. armed forces if we went to war against Russia or China.\n\nGabbard acknowledged that she knew of the report’s conclusions, but she declined to answer when senators asked her five times if she viewed Snowden as a “traitor.” Nor would she grab on to a senator’s invitation to admit, at the very least, that Snowden’s actions had damaged U.S. security. Instead, she said she was focusing on “the future”—specifically, to open routes for whistleblowers to make complaints about illegal policies without having to do what Snowden did.\n\nShe was asked whether she thought professionals in the U.S. intelligence agencies—or those in the countries that share highly classified intelligence with us—would trust her, given her views on Snowden. She replied that she had received “letters” from intelligence officials who defended her nomination.\n\nSenators of both parties also asked about her opposition to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the U.S. to intercept communications of suspected terrorists or criminals abroad. The interceptions are sometimes done in ways that pick up calls involving Americans as well. Informed that 60 percent of a president’s intelligence comes from information gathered through Section 702, Gabbard said at the hearing that she has changed her mind on this issue as a result of reforms that were made to the law. She was asked which reforms changed her mind. She didn’t answer.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, the Democratic vice chairman of the committee, said he didn’t “buy” her “confirmation conversion” on the issue anyway. He quoted her appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast in May 2024—one month after the reforms passed—saying that they “took an already bad problem and made it many, many times worse.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Michael Bennet got into the hearing’s most forceful—and, as it turned out, damning—exchange with the nominee. He quoted Gabbard’s tweet, posted just hours after Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, noting that the war “could have been avoided if Biden had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine’s membership in NATO.” He also quoted her remark on a podcast not long after, saying that the United States and NATO were waging a “regime-change war against Russia … via their proxy in Ukraine.”\n\nBennet asked if she was aware that her comments were “in alignment with what Russians have said to justify” the invasion. She replied, “I don’t pay attention to Russian propaganda. My goal is to say the truth, regardless of whether you like it or not.”\n\nThis took even Bennet by surprise. “I’m shocked,” he said, “to hear you now saying you agree that Putin was justified in rolling over the peaceful border of Ukraine.”\n\nHe then turned to the committee’s Republican chairman, Sen. Tom Cotton, and said, “Can’t we do better than someone who doesn’t believe in 702, who can’t answer whether Edward Snowden was a traitor, who made excuses for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine?”\n\nPerhaps the second most damning moment came during questions by Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. He started, as did the other senators, by thanking Gabbard for her service (she served in Iraq and Kuwait as a member of the Army National Guard and remains a lieutenant-colonel in the Reserves), then asked her how she would sift through all the intelligence and make conclusions. She replied that she would “build a strong team” of analysts around her.\n\nWith that, Kelly brought out the noose. As a member of Congress and as recently as this month, he noted, Gabbard cast doubt on the intelligence community’s unanimous conclusion that Assad was culpable for two specific chemical weapons attacks on his own people. In fact, he went on, in 2017, then-President Trump declassified a vast trove of materials showing how the intel agencies reached that conclusion—yet Gabbard still doubted it. Why?\n\nGabbard replied that she feared Barack Obama—who was president at the time of the allegations—would use the intel as a “pretext” for sending “a half-million troops to do regime change” in Syria. And she relied on doubts raised in a study by MIT professor Ted Postol.\n\n“Were you aware of Postol’s appearance on Russia TV?” Kelly asked. “Yes,” she replied. “Were you aware that Postol relied on a chemistry student who defended Assad’s regime?” he asked. “Not at the time,” she answered. “Did you attempt to weigh [Postol’s] claims against the intelligence community’s evidence?” he asked. “Yes,” she—remarkably—replied.\n\nKelly sighed. “So here’s my concern,” he said. At the start of the hearing, “you described a thoughtful approach to analyzing intelligence. But we just walked through how you came to Assad’s use of chemical weapons with a different approach. You started in a place of doubting the conclusion of the U.S. intelligence community, then you sought out information that confirmed your view. You accepted the view of people who were sympathetic to Russia.” The intelligence agencies “don’t get it right 100 percent of the time, but when you were skeptical of the IC, you would not apply the same skepticism to people who were sympathetic with Assad.”\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created in 2005 as a result of findings that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks four years earlier could have been halted if the U.S. intelligence agencies hadn’t worked in isolation from one another. The idea was that the DNI would have access to all intelligence and would coordinate the activities and reports of the 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. He or she would also serve as the president’s chief intelligence adviser, the official who writes and serves up the president’s daily intelligence briefing.\n\nThis was one of the very few confirmation hearings this month where members of both parties expressed serious reservations about one of Trump’s nominees. If a flicker of sense still shines above a handful of seats on the Republican side of the Senate, Thursday’s hearing should mark the end of Tulsi Gabbard.",

    "authors": ["Alexander Sammon"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOn Wednesday night, an American Airlines regional jet collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter over D.C., en route to DCA airport. More than 60 people are feared dead in the crash, including passengers, crew, and service members aboard the helicopter, which would make it the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States in a quarter century.\n\nIt marks the first major crisis of the nascent Trump presidency, and one with particularly bad optics for the president. In his war with the administrative state and in his determination to gore federal spending, Trump had already fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration and the Coast Guard and gutted a key aviation safety advisory committee, all just 10 days before the crash. As the Daily Beast reported, Federal Aviation Administration head Michael Whitaker stepped down on Jan. 20, after Elon Musk, the spear tip of Trump’s “cost cutting” spree, demanded that he quit.\n\nIt’s a truism that it’s bad form to politicize a tragedy, and Democrats have often abided that concept. Not surprisingly, Trump entered Thursday’s presser, his first public comments on the crash, raring to blame it on his enemies, real and imagined. Getting out in front of those facts, Trump called for a moment of silence, and then immediately began to assail Democrats, before essentially concluding that diverse hiring initiatives (“DEI”) were the real culprit to blame for this tragedy.\n\nThe public address was full of political invective. Trump began by going after Joe Biden, accusing the former president of changing nebulous aviation safety and hiring standards “to lower than ever before.”\n\n“I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first,” Trump said. “They put politics at a level nobody’s ever seen … their policy was horrible and their politics was even worse.”\n\nNext up was former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “He’s a disaster … disaster as a mayor, and a disaster now,” Trump said, adding “He’s just got a good line of bullshit”—a surprisingly blunt insult even for Trump. “Run it right into the ground with his diversity.”\n\nFrom there, Trump pivoted to the next culprit: DEI. “I do want to point out various articles,” he said, and began leafing through news stories to read bad-faith headlines about diversity and inclusion hiring practices for air traffic control, the federal aviation authority, and more.\n\nIt was almost unbelievable to hear—unbelievable, even, to the president, who himself admitted, “we don’t know that necessarily it’s even the controllers’ fault.” In fact, no evidence was presented that the air traffic controllers, the American Airlines pilot, or the driver of the Army helicopter was a diversity hire.\n\n“It just could have been,” he said, defending his undeniably irrelevant and shamelessly political explanation. Never let the facts get in the way of a good story.\n\nAfter reading several Fox News headlines, Trump showed off the integrated nature of his new administration by handing the microphone to two separate members of his Fox News Cabinet, recently confirmed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nDuffy praised Trump for his exemplary leadership, and then assured the American public that “what happened yesterday shouldn’t have happened,” a sentiment most Americans probably didn’t need explained to them. “When Americans take off in airplanes they should expect to land at their destination. That didn’t happen yesterday.” Duffy then suggested it could be DEI.\n\nHegseth’s turn at the lectern also featured praise of Trump, but had a little more substance. His short statement indicated that it was likely the Army helicopter that was at fault, given the available facts, but that DEI definitely might have been involved. That admission made Trump’s anti-DEI screed look even more ridiculous, though it didn’t slow him down at all. Vice President J.D. Vance came in to quickly ensure that even if there was no clear DEI, the general atmosphere of DEI could have worn down the nondiversity hires who seemed to be at fault here.\n\n“How could diversity have something to do with this crash?” asked one of the journalists in the press pool, after Trump returned to the podium. “Because I have common sense,” answered the president.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the Democratic former transportation secretary, fired back immediately, tweeting:\n\nDespicable. As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA. One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.\n\nBut other Democrats have been slow to respond. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer went for a gentle tsking, tweeting that “President Trump’s news conference on the heartbreaking, horrific accident at DCA” was full of conspiracy theories that “[turn] your stomach.”\n\nAnd outlandish as Republican talking points—and politicization of this tragedy—seem, the difference in message discipline and opportunism between Trump and his Democratic opponents is perhaps the starkest thing of all. Democratic leadership has been playing possum with Trump in the first weeks of his new administration, seemingly afraid of being accused of excessive politicization of his executive orders or Cabinet nominees. (In fact, after Duffy’s inspired comments, Trump made sure to mention that Democrats had voted for his confirmation.)\n\nBut why? Being accused of thin political opportunism is not a concern Trump has ever abided by, and that attitude is core to his political success. It’s part of the reason he has steamrolled Democrats at every turn in the early days and weeks of his second stint in the White House. And if Democratic Party members thought he might go easy on them in exchange, the presser made clear that there will be no such reward for playing nice.\n\nThe implausible emphasis on DEI as the source of all the world’s ills, meanwhile, has already reached laughable levels, proof of how little the administration actually has to offer the American public as it pursues its deep spending cuts. If Democrats are paying attention to Trump, or learning from him, they will use it as an opportunity to go on the offensive.",

    "title": "Trump news: The key moment in Kash Patel’s FBI confirmation hearing.",
    "authors": ["Molly Olmstead"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nIn his confirmation hearing for FBI director on Thursday, Kash Patel presented himself as a man of experience, fairness, and devotion to civic duty. In the hours he spent in the room before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he repeatedly insisted that he had no tolerance for violence against law enforcement; that he sought only to ensure to protect the country while respecting its citizens’ constitutional rights; and that he would approach the grave responsibility of the position with absolute seriousness.\n\nThis was not, in other words, the Kash Patel of the Trump campaign of the last four years.\n\nThe Patel that most people are familiar with built his public persona around hounding Trump’s enemies and promising to punish them if they got in the president’s way. Patel, who has by his own admission been on a “thousand” podcast episodes, loves to blast the “deep state” in conversation with other conspiracy theorists. His book Government Gangsters includes a glossary of the deep state actors Patel wants investigated and punished, should he be confirmed into a position to do so. (The list includes Joe Biden, former FBI director James Comey, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, and former Attorney General Bill Barr, to name a few.) On Steve Bannon’s podcast, Patel promised journalists who reported, correctly, that Joe Biden won the 2020 election: “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly.”\n\nAnd yet, despite the plentiful on-record examples of Patel saying extreme things, he acted during the hearing as if all those comments were being taken out of context or skewed in a way that misrepresented his intent. This tactic may have been his only real option, as there really is no grey area or nuance to what Patel has spent years doing. Maybe, when presented with clear, direct evidence of his own statements and activities, Patel thought his only option was to lie.\n\nNo moment showed this more clearly than an exchange in which Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin asked Patel about his association with Stew Peters, a far-right podcast host who has described Judaism as a “death cult” and argued that Black people are genetically inferior.\n\n“Stew Peters? Does that ring a bell?” Durbin asked.\n\n“Not off the top of my head,” Patel said.\n\n“You made eight separate appearances on his podcast,” Durbin said. “I’m just asking—when it comes to your association with individuals, why are so many of them in this category?”\n\nDurbin didn’t quite spell out what he meant by “this category,” but he did describe Peters as a conspiracy theorist and name Ted Nugent, another right-wing conspiracy theorist, in the question. Essentially, Durbin asked why Patel is associated with so many wing nuts.\n\n“My association, as you loosely define it, is in appearing in media over a thousand times to take on people who are putting on conspiricitorial [sic] theories and to devow [sic] them of their false impressions, and to talk to them about the truth,” Patel said. “That is something I will always continue to fight for, senator.”\n\nThis is a laughably false claim. Patel does not go onto these shows to debate conspiracy theorists. He fuels them.\n\nSimilarly, when asked about his association with QAnon during the hearing, Patel insisted that he had always “publicly rejected outright” the conspiracy theories associated with it. This is, again, a falsehood. Patel has consistently amplified QAnon material on social media, posted about socializing with prominent QAnon supporters, instigated the creation of a new QAnon hashtag, and even signed his own books with the QAnon slogan “WWG1WGA.”\n\nAnd then again, when asked about his work helping to produce a song by the “J6 Prison Choir,” Patel insisted that he hadn’t known there were Capitol rioters in the group and that he wasn’t aware of who made the recording.\n\nPatel is not the only nominee to feel the need to obfuscate his background. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for example, insisted in his hearing Wednesday that he was not an anti-vaxxer, despite dedicating the latter half of his career to anti-vaccine advocacy. Kennedy, at least, stood by some of his more outlandish opinions; Patel simply denied his were ever uttered.\n\nThere may be a silver lining here: It is clearly still considered undesirable for the prospective FBI director to openly endorse QAnon or associate with violent insurrectionists. But we may come to expect this tactic more in the next few years, as Trump appointees fill out the executive branch.

    "title": "Trump’s Budget Debacle Reveals a Major Flaw in His Shock-and-Awe Approach",
    "authors": ["Mark Joseph Stern"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nPresident Donald Trump began his second term with a wave of shock and awe, pumping out explosive executive orders so quickly that neither the media nor the public could keep up. For a full week, the strategy mostly succeeded. Then it blew up in his face. The administration’s effort on Tuesday to freeze trillions of dollars in government spending set off mass chaos throughout the country—not the kind of chaos that this president seeks to foment and exploit, but the kind that undermines his broader goals and leads to an embarrassing course reversal. The disastrous episode illustrates how his administration’s haste and incompetence can still sabotage its own agenda through terrible lawyering that won’t hold up in court. It confirms that Trump’s biggest legal vulnerability is still, after all these years, the sheer ineptitude that underlies so many of his most expansive and malicious schemes.\n\nEarly reporting already paints a clear, devastating picture of the unforced errors that led to Tuesday’s catastrophe. It was, in some ways, a perfect storm of overweening ambition and lack of preparation at the Office of Management and Budget, which imposed the funding freeze in a cryptic two-page memo. Confidential OMB documents obtained by HuffPost reveal that the agency intended to tee up a fight over the president’s authority to impound, or rescind, money appropriated by Congress. Impoundment is prohibited by federal statute and likely unconstitutional as well. Yet the documents lay out a plot to “use executive orders to impound funds,” then “seek legal precedent” affirming the president’s constitutional prerogative to unilaterally withhold appropriations. Trump promised to do exactly that during the campaign, as have his nominees to lead the agency.\n\nTuesday’s spending freeze seems to have been the agency’s first attempt to set up a test case that would, if successful, massively expand Trump’s power over the federal budget. But there was a problem: Russell Vought, the president’s nominee for OMB director, has not yet been confirmed. More than anyone else, Vought has laid the groundwork for a legal showdown over impoundment. (In 2019, as acting OMB director, he played a major role in the administration’s refusal to disburse Ukraine aid—a brazenly illegal impoundment that led to Trump’s first impeachment for attempting to extort Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into launching an investigation of Joe Biden.) With Vought not yet back at the helm, the agency lacked a Senate-confirmed leader who could engineer and defend an impoundment with the best possible odds of holding up in court.\n\nSo, according to the New York Times, the job fell upon Mark Paoletta, OMB’s Trump-appointed general counsel and a longtime conservative operative. It might be more accurate to say that Paoletta took the task upon himself—because he reportedly failed to secure approval from the White House at any stage of the process. Paoletta is an experienced lawyer, but a reckless and controversial one, even on the right. He served as OMB’s general counsel during Trump’s first term too; in that position, he worked with Vought to withhold Ukraine aid, then actively misled congressional investigators probing the scandal. His cynical disregard for the law drew bipartisan criticism, and the president’s legal team blocked him from joining the group during the first impeachment trial.\n\nIn recent years, Paoletta’s most prominent role has been as chief defender of Clarence and Ginni Thomas. He guided Thomas through his confirmation battle in 1991 and has remained close to the family since; he even appears in the notorious painting of Thomas hanging out with Harlan Crow and Leonard Leo, a work displayed in the justice’s foyer. Paoletta represented Ginni Thomas when she was interviewed by the Jan. 6 committee because of her efforts to push Republican lawmakers to overturn the 2020 election. And he took on the mantle of Clarence Thomas’ chief defender after the justice’s multiple ethics scandals came to light in 2023.\n\nIt seems fair to assume that after the time Paoletta has spent on the sidelines, his aptitude for operating the machinery of state has grown rusty. The budget-freeze memo that he allegedly wrote was baffling from start to finish—unreasoned, hopelessly vague, yet sweeping in its demand for an immediate halt to appropriations. It reads not as the careful work of a scrupulous lawyer but as the fever dream of an inebriated anarchist unleashing years of pent-up fury all at once. Paoletta was so arrogantly confident of his handiwork that he reportedly unleashed it without even consulting White House staff secretary Will Scharf or deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The administration was, by all accounts, blindsided by the sudden suspension of innumerable federal grants and programs.\n\nTo make matters worse, Paoletta currently has no checks at OMB. The agency’s former leadership, appointed by Biden, resigned when Trump took office, and the president named Matthew Vaeth as acting director. According to his LinkedIn profile, Vaeth previously served as the assistant director of the Legislative Reference Division, a relatively small office within OMB that conveys the administration’s position on legislative proposals to Congress. Trump’s appointment of acting directors on Jan. 20 was notoriously messy. For instance, his aides listed the wrong person as acting director of the FBI on the White House website; when they realized the mistake, they simply switched plans, keeping the person they’d mistakenly identified and bumping the one they had actually chosen. Trump’s team appeared to prioritize the elevation of midlevel apparatchiks who would sign whatever the White House put in front of them. It evidently found such a person in Vaeth, who dutifully affixed his name to Tuesday’s memo—even though it was reportedly Paoletta who wrote the misbegotten document.\n\n(Rachel Cauley, an OMB spokesperson, told the Atlantic Wednesday that Trump’s appointees had nothing to do with the confidential document that laid out the impoundment plan. Cauley, it’s worth noting, was previously a spokesperson at the conservative Center for Renewing America—where Paoletta served as a senior fellow, churning out defenses of impoundment that do not withstand scrutiny.)\n\nThis sloppy process looks bad to the public. But it looks even worse in court. Judges despise slapdash work of this sort and can get offended when government officials ask them to uphold it in the face of obvious deficiencies. Federal agencies are legally required to undertake their missions with due deliberation and candor; the prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” policymaking lies at the heart of administrative law. The courts’ obligation to invalidate unreasoned or dishonest rules and regulations dovetails with a deeper hostility, shared by most judges, of lazy lawyering and shoddy work product. It was therefore no surprise that one district court judge blocked the OMB memo Wednesday, citing its egregious and expansive consequences. Another district court judge also looks poised to freeze it, though he sought clarity on Wednesday from state attorneys general who had sued the Trump administration over what such a freeze might look like after OMB rescinded the original memo with explanation. (White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt promptly denied that a rescission had occurred.)\n\nTrump ran into this problem over and over again in his first term at every level of the judiciary. He suffered two major defeats at the Supreme Court because his administration cut corners and assumed that the justices would look the other way. Yes, today’s high court is more conservative. But there is probably still a limit to what Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett will swallow. And in the meantime, Trump will flail in the lower courts, which can keep his orders on ice for a while before SCOTUS steps in. When the Justice Department seeks an emergency stay of an injunction, the bar for Supreme Court intervention is quite high, and the justices must “balance the equities” to determine whether the government’s claimed harm is severe enough to justify stepping in. Roberts and Barrett may be less sympathetic toward the government’s purported injury when it is defending a policy that obviously originated as lawless slop before being spruced up by mercenary lawyers.\n\nThe best that can be said of the Trump administration’s approach is that it tests the limits of what courts will allow. During his first term, for instance, Trump famously put out two iterations of the Muslim ban that failed in court before crafting a third iteration that (barely) survived SCOTUS review. But repeated lower-court defeats help cement a narrative that he is abusing his powers and cruising for defeat. And at least five justices on the Supreme Court may grow weary of his administration’s constantly pushing the outer limits of their tolerance. It is always a tactical mistake for presidents to assume they have SCOTUS in their pocket. This week’s OMB debacle indicates that Trump and his allies may learn that painful lesson much sooner than they think.",

    "title": "Patel confirmation: I just read Kash’s wild children’s books about Trump. They should be in this hearing.",
    "authors": ["Rebecca Onion"],
    "raw_text": "Before Trump loyalist Kash Patel, who has been nominated to lead the FBI, answered questions at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday, the New York Times’ David Fahrenthold examined Patel’s apparent use of his nonprofit Kash Foundation for self-promotion in the years between the two Donald Trump administrations. Among many things the foundation promoted—including Kash-branded T-shirts and scarves and a book for adults titled Government Gangsters—was a children’s book in which, Fahrenthold wrote, “a besieged King Donald is helped by a wizard named Kash.”\n\nThere are actually three Plot Against the King books, marketed as suitable for children “ages 3 and up.” They’re published by Brave Books, which was established in 2021, boasts celebrity authors like Kirk Cameron, Kevin Sorbo, and Bethany Hamilton, and describes itself as a “Christian publishing company that makes books for kids that reinforce biblically-based, foundational values.” Two of the Patel books are illustrated by James Scrawl and one by Laura Vincent, all in a colorful, derivative fantasy style. One book fictionalizes Russiagate and the Steele dossier, the second does the same with the 2020 election, and the third covers the Department of Justice’s lawsuits against Donald Trump. In each, the wizard Kash—all-knowing, all-discerning, bearing the sobriquet the “Distinguished Discoverer”—does battle against the enemies of the “merchant Donald,” who becomes “King Donald” after the people of the kingdom vote for him on “Choosing Day.”\n\nThese books read like someone fed storylines from the Trump era into an A.I. trained on MAGA posts on social media and gave it the command: “Tell this as a medieval story in a slightly funny way.” Democrat Adam Schiff plays a part in books one and three, first as “the shifty knight,” then a “shifty jester,” and then just as “Shifty.” The media are “heralds” who hate King Donald and accept any lie about him that Shifty tells. Hillary Clinton is “Hillary Queenton,” Biden is “Baron Von Biden,” Kamala Harris is “Comma-la-la-la,” and Mark Zuckerberg—who gets a cameo thanks to the Trumpworld idea that he participated in the 2020 election fraud—is “Mischievous Metamark.” The DOJ is a “Dragon of Jalapeños,” who gets small as a dog before eating hot peppers, then bigger when he’s fed some, until he breathes fire.\n\nIf I were a child reading these, and I were paying attention, I’d have questions. Why are people voting for a king? Why does Biden’s Choosing Day win result in a barony, rather than a kingship, like Donald got? Why is the “shifty knight” friends with the heralds? Why name Kamala “Comma-la-la-la” instead of “Commie-la,” which would make so much more sense, and be funnier, too? (OK, maybe a child wouldn’t trip up on that last one, but that seemed like a real missed opportunity to me.) Aren’t “heralds” usually working for the king, not just acting as freelance trumpeters of random news? Some of these murky bits could have used one more pass for a punch-up, but some of them are just the inevitable result of the comically transparent agenda here. Without a MAGA mindset, for example, you can’t explain why the heralds would hate King Donald so much that they’d lie about him, or why there are no “people of the Land of the Free” who have any genuine objections to Donald’s kingship.\n\nActually, MAGA-hardline ideas about Trump’s natural, never-ending popularity lend themselves well to a children’s story set in some nonspecific “olden times” location. One page in the second book in the series, the one about the 2020 election, shows people lining up by party to place ballots in boxes, like people used to do in the 19th-century United States. The line for the blue box has only Hillary Queenton, Comma-la-la-la, Shifty, and a few others in it, while the line for the red box stretches off into the distance. Of course Biden’s win was a fraud! You can see it with your own eyes.\n\nLiberals publish plenty of incomprehensible, politically motivated children’s books. In fact, I’d argue that liberals pioneered the genre. Many well-meaning social-justice-y books for kids under 5 assume previous knowledge of abstract concepts, histories, and tropes that actual children regard with utter confusion. That, contra Ted Cruz’s grandstanding about poor little babies being made to feel guilt for being white, was the real problem with Antiracist Baby, the board-book version of which contained such iconically toddler-pleasing lines as “Nothing disrupts racism more than when we confess/the racist ideas that we sometimes express” and “Some people get more, while others get less/because policies don’t always grant equal access.”\n\nJust as I doubt a 2-year-old would come away from that book feeling guilty (you have to engage and understand to feel guilt), I really doubt that the trio of Plot Against the King books, on the merits of their story or illustrations, will turn any children MAGA. The storylines don’t lend themselves very well to discussion, particularly the storyline of the first book, which is just as confusing as the Russiagate saga was to everyone but total news-hounds when it unfolded. But I don’t think that’s the point. It’s about sitting down and sharing your enthusiasm for political stories with your kid. And if people are doing that (thousands of five-star reviewers on Amazon say they are), the books are “working.”\n\nCredit where it’s due, though. The river of poop created by the 2,000 mules that flows through the city on Choosing Day in the second book in this series, causing townspeople to trip and fall on their butts in the middle of the street? That’s pretty funny. I bet my kid would like it.",

    "title": "Wheel of Fortune: We know what’s coming for Vanna White. Why aren’t we ready?",
    "authors": ["Luke Winkie"],
    "raw_text": "For a moment there, it seemed like the Vanna White story was going to end ugly. The 67-year-old presenter is the final standard-bearer of America’s game-show golden age—a TV generation that has been largely cleaned out by Bob Barker’s death, Pat Sajak’s departure, and the protracted succession battle for the Throne of Trebek. Left behind is an ersatz fleet of programming that, while the fault of nobody in particular, is a little cold to the touch. The ideal game show viewing experience should evoke memories of running a fever in your childhood bedroom at high noon, watching bleary-eyed as a trio of panelists guesstimate the retail cost of a vacuum cleaner. But Drew Carey is never going to become synonymous with The Price Is Right, and the selection of Ryan Seacrest for the Wheel of Fortune podium seemed specifically designed to lock the brand in institutional decline. (Ken Jennings, now on Jeopardy!, is a different, more complicated subject.) That makes Vanna White the last icon standing—a holdover from a glitzier time—and in the twilight of her career, she is asserting her own value more than ever.\n\nIn 2023, with Sajak headed for the exit and her own contract nearing its conclusion at Sony, reports surfaced that the once and future vowel merchant had not received a raise on her $3 million annual salary in 18 years. That’s a far cry from the $15 million Sajak was reportedly taking home, so White headed into negotiations for her next contract with the intention of leveling the playing field.\n\nIn the end, Wheel of Fortune blinked. White will be around for at least the next year after inking a contract extension lasting until 2026, with provisions that include the pay raise she coveted.\n\nWhen the show returned last September with Seacrest as host, there were rumors of backstage tension between the new on-air pair. If that’s true, you can’t really tell. In fact, you could say that Vanna had gracefully embraced her senioritis era. The woman never held the heftiest job in show business; she touches letters, she maintains a vast wardrobe of sparkling floor-length dresses, she flashes telegenic grimaces to contestants who brick out on a consonant. (She has blithely joked about this fact herself for years: “I can’t say that it is a hard job, because it’s not,” she said in 2018.) But her relationship with Sajak—the subject of loosely sourced romantic intrigue for decades, and perhaps the show’s primary cultural draw—is no longer a daily performance. So it seems like a mostly checked-out Vanna is here to cash a few more checks while kindling a fine wooden chemistry with Seacrest for a couple of seasons before disappearing into the middle distance of a glorious Malibu sunset. The easiest job in broadcasting has somehow gotten even easier.\n\nThe day of her departure is surely coming sooner than later. Over the last several seasons of Wheel of Fortune, Maggie Sajak—the 29-year-old daughter of the venerable game show host—has been not-so-subtly groomed as a potential heir to White when she decides to hang up her heels. Maggie stepped onto the set in 2020 while her father was recovering from surgery in order to take on some hosting duties, and, more portentously, to touch some of those letters herself. (Today, Maggie serves as the show’s “social media correspondent,” which is a makework gig for old-money Hollywood nepo babies if I’ve ever heard one.) A furtive continuity plan for an aging superstar tends to be the stuff of relentless tabloid titillation, but Vanna herself has gestured toward this inevitability. Shortly after locking in the terms of her new deal, White conceded to E! that Maggie could make for a “good replacement” at the board. And in a pointed, Substance-tinged Instagram post last August, Maggie—who uncannily resembles a younger, blonder Vanna—swapped gowns with Wheel of Fortune’s matriarch and beckoned the commenters to guess which dainty number belonged to who. It was both an enormous body flex and, for longtime fans, a reminder that the sharks are circling.\n\nIs Vanna White on Wheel of Fortune an odd thing to mourn? The comments on Reddit and Instagram that brace for the emotional impact of her retirement can seem a little absurd. But beyond childhood nostalgia, an older generation remembers Vanna the breakout star, and more importantly, Vanna the sex symbol. She was a woman worthy of a bestselling (if content-light) memoir; whose teased bangs appeared on a promenade of checkout-aisle magazine covers across the country throughout the 1980s. (“Vanna White—Her Seduction of America,” announced a headline in a 1989 issue of TV Guide, alongside an image of the host looking—it needs to be said—stunning in a pair of Princess Diana jeans.) Her stardom seemed to summon an unhealthy fusion of rage, thirst, and envy in the American ferment. The press dubbed it “Vannamania,” and it centered on an anxiety that endures to this day: How does a woman who reveals letters for a living achieve such a galactic level of fame? Does she deserve it? Must she, and the rest of girlhood, be brought to heel?\n\n“Why did she become a role model for young women?” opined a flabbergasted Chicago Tribune in 1992. “Many of whom evidently aspired to a career in pointing and smiling?”\n\nThat question is downright myopic by modern standards, and not just for the blatant sexism. We have all become inundated by beautiful people through the locus of vertical video in 2024, and each of them reflexively understands that their own hotness is grounds enough for fame and fortune: the body-rolling yoga girls, the flexing Chads, the gorgeous couples on permanent vacation, Hawk Tuah, bounties of sponcon and discount codes—in some ways, it all comes back to Vanna White, who never apologized for earning so much by doing so little. In that sense, she’s a trailblazer.\n\nIn 2025, if anyone wishes to Be Like Vanna, you must exploit angles outside of network television. In a time of Addison Rae and Alix Earle, it is hard to imagine a socialite being forged on a game show set ever again. (If Maggie Sajak ever truly wants to eclipse her forebearer, she might need to learn the “Renegade” dance.) But as the only star left on the circuit, White is giving us one final gift as she prepares her exit. Her retirement and succession plan, whenever it comes to be, may very well be the last interesting story to surface on a game show. At the very least it will be far more compelling than whoever steps in for Steve Harvey on Family Feud. The saga will surely culminate with a few months of juicy speculation, and one tearful finale—a great exaltation of Vannamania before Seacrest shepherds the show to its funeral. She was always the most interesting person in the room, without anyone ever knowing why. That’s show business, baby.",

    "authors": ["Sam Adams"],
    "raw_text": "People at Sundance love to talk about the future of film, but this year, much of the chatter that took place between screenings and in bus lines was about the future of the festival itself. Although festival director Eugene Hernandez declined to answer specific questions, reports suggest that it’s all but a done deal that Sundance will have a new home outside Park City in 2027. The official list of candidates has been narrowed to three cities—Boulder, Cincinnati, and Salt Lake—and although the latter option would retain at least a foothold in the pricey resort town that has been the festival’s home since 1981, the odds of staying in Utah at all seem increasingly slim. Even for those who made the trek and shelled out the cash, this year’s on-the-ground festival felt reduced in both size and scope, as if Sundance were downsizing before a big move.\n\nThat’s a nice way of saying that Sundance’s dramatic competition, which is traditionally its prime showcase for emerging cinematic voices, was unusually and even historically weak, split between delicately underwhelming dramas and conceptual big swings that were also big misses. By contrast, the documentary competition was as strong as any in memory, which is why this guide to the best of Sundance’s virtual options is tilted heavily in favor of nonfiction.\n\nFive years since the COVID-19 pandemic slingshotted Sundance into the streaming era, the festival’s virtual component, which runs through midnight Sunday, remains one of the most frustratingly well-kept secrets in the cinematic universe. Every movie in Sundance’s four competitive sections, along with a smattering from elsewhere in the lineup, is available online. (Virtual screenings do sell out, but some of those movies will likely pop up again in the slots reserved for the winners of the festival’s jury awards, which will be announced Friday.) There’s little from the big-ticket premieres and buzzy Midnight section—no Together or Peter Hujar’s Day or If I Had Legs I’d Kick You—but there’s a lot to savor, especially if you like your fiction non-.\n\nBLKNWS: Terms & Conditions\n\nPulled from Sundance over an editing dispute with its principal financier mere days before the festival began, Kahlil Joseph’s heady, dense collage was a cause célèbre even before it was restored to the lineup, thanks to its acquisition by a producer of 2024’s The Apprentice. With settings ranging from a trans-Atlantic biennale aboard an Afrofuturist ocean liner to the last days of W.E.B. DuBois, the movie churns through reference points and ideas with deliberately disorienting speed. Updating an excerpt from Jean-Luc Godard’s Vivre Sa Vie with subtitles that invoke the Wu-Tang Clan, Joseph, who directed parts of Beyoncé’s Lemonade, incorporates visual contributions from filmmakers like Garrett Bradley and Raven Jackson and eight credited screenwriters, not to mention citations and interviews from Wole Soyinka, Dionne Brand, and countless others. It’s a work that could take far longer than the virtual platform’s five-hour viewing window to fully ingest and still feels like the gallery installation as which it began, but there’s nothing like it in the festival’s lineup, nor elsewhere in the cinematic landscape.\n\nLife After\n\nStarting out on the trail of Elizabeth Bouvia, who petitioned the California government to let her starve herself to death after cerebral palsy and degenerative arthritis left her paralyzed and in constant pain, filmmaker Reid Davenport (I Didn’t See You There) embarks on an exploration of the fight for the right to die, and how people with disabilities find the lives they’re actually living devalued in the process. In Canada, where medical assistance in dying became the law of the land in 2016, assisted suicide has become an escape valve for people whose suffering is due less to their illnesses than to a lack of affordable health care, and has expanded even to people with autism and ADHD. And in the United States, a terminally ill teenager’s ending of her own life was celebrated by a Wisconsin town, a community that, Davenport says, didn’t “support her decision so much as they were responsible for it.” Davenport, who has a disability himself, clearly takes the subject personally; at one point, he starts filling out an application for MAID as an impulsive joke, then finds himself too overcome by emotion to finish the task. But on a subject where the voices of people with disabilities have been pushed aside, this passionate and nuanced film deserves to be heard.\n\nMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\n\nIf your memory of Marlee Matlin goes blank between Children of a Lesser God and CODA, Shoshannah Stern’s documentary will be a revelation, even the parts blurred by tears. Becoming the first deaf actress to win an Academy Award was just the beginning of a journey that included escaping an abusive relationship with her co-star William Hurt and spearheading the fight for closed captioning, as well as finding her place in a deaf community she sometimes found herself at odds with. Stern, who is also deaf, uses captions as an expressive tool—Matlin’s words get their own shade of purple, a distinctive visual voice—and doesn’t slather her sign-language interviews in music, so that hearing audiences have to sit in the silence of a world that, for once, is not made for them. Like Matlin’s life, the movie suggests that deaf filmmakers can open up new frontiers for everyone.\n\nOmaha\n\nAs a widowed father at the end of his rope, John Magaro (Past Lives, First Cow) is weighed down by melancholy in Cole Weber’s debut. Waking his kids just before the police turn up at their door to evict them, he packs them into his barely functional car and hits the road, cracking dad jokes as he counts every penny. Their spirits buoyed by a mix CD left by their late mother, the children catch on only slowly, not noticing the panic in their father’s eyes when groceries cost more than he expected. It’s a film of tender beauty and small moments of intimacy and desperation, although the balance is thrown off by a closing title that turns a heartbreaking story into a case study.\n\nThe Perfect Neighbor\n\nIn the opening moments of Geeta Gandbhir’s riveting and unsettling documentary, we’re riding in a police car to the sound of frantic 911 calls, rushing down darkened roads until we finally arrive, too late to stop a crime that has already occurred. The Perfect Neighbor skips back in time but stays fixed to that perspective, using police body-cam footage to chart the escalating tensions between Susan Lorincz, a middle-aged white woman living alone in a Florida subdivision, and the largely Black families around her, whose children she regards as an intolerable nuisance and, eventually, a threat. Time and again, the cops respond to calls from the woman the neighborhood kids refer to as “the Karen,” explaining that the children have a right to play in the vacant plot next to her house, and time and again they depart telling everyone to behave while muttering “psycho” under their breath. As Lorincz’s behavior escalates, the families tell the police that she’s thrown objects at their children and yelled racial slurs, but the cops say they’re powerless to act on anything they haven’t directly observed, and we can only watch the scene of the future crime recede in the distance as the cameras pull away. Gandbhir’s movie is a study in the fatal flaws of Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” laws, but it’s also a lesson in the limits of the police’s ability to stop a tragedy before it happens, and the way a place they visit only when there’s trouble becomes a place where they expect it.\n\nPrime Minister\n\nMichelle Walshe and Lindsay Utz’s portrait of New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern uses real-time audio diaries and footage shot by Ardern’s husband to provide an uncommonly intimate look at the pressures of global leadership. Only 37 and pregnant with her first child when she was elected to the top post, Ardern was faced with crises that would have tested the most seasoned politician, including the worst terrorist attack in the country’s modern history and the onset of the COVID pandemic. Ardern’s youth and gender are the subject of frequent attacks—one antilockdown protester refers to her as “some girl in a skirt”—but she sticks to her progressive principles, even while struggling privately with impostor syndrome. Given the role American radicalization played in rallying opposition to Ardern’s COVID containment policies (Trump flags are prominently displayed outside the country’s Parliament), one wishes for a better ending to Ardern’s time in office, or at least more self-reflection about what could have gone differently. But at a time when most leaders keep cameras at a distance, Ardern’s openness and vulnerability are both inspiring and instructive, a blueprint for a more humane form of governance that others can now study at length.\n\nPredators\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007, the NBC series To Catch a Predator used online operatives and in-person decoys posing as underage children to lure more than 500 men to “sting houses,” where host Chris Hansen would confront them on camera with a simple request: “Help me understand.” But as David Osit’s documentary makes increasingly clear, the show’s main goal wasn’t to understand child sexual predators, or to bring them to justice, but to stage their humiliation for public enjoyment. While some viewed it as a public service—Jon Stewart, in one vintage interview clip, tells Hansen he wishes the show could air seven days a week—others consumed it as lurid slapstick, chuckling as accused pedophiles begged for their lives or sprinted blindly for safety. As a top-rated series mustering resources beyond the means of any local police department, TCAP, as it’s known to its enduring fandom, undoubtedly caught criminals. But it also blurred the line between law enforcement and ad-sponsored entertainment, getting the goods on camera even when it jeopardized any eventual prosecution. Osit’s provocative and disquieting movie probes To Catch a Predator’s checkered legacy and the cavalier toxicity of the amateur copycats it spawned, while turning the same unsparing lens back on itself.\n\nSorry, Baby\n\nBeginning as a prickly comedy about a reunion between graduate school friends, Eva Victor’s debut rewinds to what an on-screen title calls “The year with the bad thing,” an unresolved trauma that Victor’s character, who stays in the small Maine town where they all studied after most of her classmates move away, finds herself processing in unexpected ways as we get closer and closer to the present. Sorry, Baby’s reserved style can lend itself to deadpan humor or lingering dread, and occasionally a combination of the two, and while the balance is sometimes uneasy, it’s also entirely assured. The whole movie feels sure of itself, even when you’re not sure what it is.\n\nSunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake)\n\nSierra Falconer’s first feature film is a quietly lyrical compendium of life on and around a Michigan lake, split into slight but evocative vignettes. A 14-year-old is stranded with her grandparents when her mother elopes, grudgingly taking notes on how to operate a one-person sailboat until she gets a taste of self-reliance; the son of an overbearing mother strives to excel at music camp, only to find that there are achievements that matter more; sisters quarrel as one gets ready to leave for culinary school. Apart from the literal fish story at the movie’s center, its segments are almost without incident, but it feels cleansing all the same.\n\n2000 Meters to Andriivka\n\nMstyslav Chernov’s follow-up to his Oscar-winning 20 Days in Mariupol is a brutally visceral depiction of modern-day trench warfare, a game of inches where the earth is soaked with blood. Helmet cameras capture Ukrainian soldiers’ agonizingly incremental approach to a strategically significant village, or what Russian attacks have left of it, in the summer of 2023, navigating a narrow strip of “forest”—by this point just a tangle of undergrowth and the spires of denuded trees—with minefields on either side. Shell casings fly into the frame as the troops open fire, and the camera crashes to the ground as they dodge incoming grenades—and sometimes goes still when they fail. Chernov captures moments of tenderness too: camaraderie between the soldiers, and, in one case, an especially tenacious cat. But his voice-over reveals that even some who survive this particular mission won’t make it home alive. Although news reports call the Ukrainian counteroffensive the largest military operation in Europe since World War II, Chernov resolutely sticks to the small scale, staying with the men who know that their determination may outlast the rest of the world’s attention. “The longer the war goes on,” one soldier comments, “the less the world will care about it.”\n\nZodiac Killer Project\n\nWhen the right to adapt a retired cop’s book that purports to reveal the identity of the U.S.’s most notorious uncaught serial killer fell through, Charlie Shackleton could have given up and moved on. Instead, he made this clever and surprising essay film, which might be the first documentary ever filmed in the conditional tense. Over distant shots of depopulated locations, Shackleton describes the reenactments he would have shot, like the moment the book’s author says he came face-to-face with the killer at a highway rest stop. He also confesses to the places where he would have bent the truth—a post office standing in for the exterior of a police station—and the times he would have shifted to “evocative b-roll,” the slickly generic imagery that’s become a mainstay of true crime. As he pulls in examples from The Jinx and Making a Murderer to illustrate his point, you realize you’re not just sitting through a pitch meeting but watching a sharp, sustained assault on true crime itself, especially as it’s proliferated in the streaming era—a critique that’s no less potent for its consistently playful wit. This might not have been the movie Shackleton set out to make, but seldom has failure bred better results.",

    "title": "Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon’s Prime Video movie is this year’s Anyone But You.",
    "authors": ["Dana Stevens"],
    "raw_text": "The Amazon Prime Video rom-com You’re Cordially Invited is written and directed by Nicholas Stoller, who made some of the more memorable comedies of the 2000s and 2010s, including Forgetting Sarah Marshall and the Neighbors movies. His new film is a would-be throwback to that era in other ways as well. It co-stars two of the biggest box-office draws of the aughts, Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon, albeit each in a role neither of them would have taken on at that time: Ferrell because his shambling every-oaf persona lent itself better to broad buddy comedies than to warmhearted romances, and Witherspoon because, 20 years ago, she would have been cast as the high-maintenance bride herself, rather than that character’s micromanaging older sister. The idea of bringing together these two titans of Hollywood likability—veterans, in Ferrell’s case literally, of the old-school studio comedy—had promise. Emphasis on the “had.”\n\nFerrell’s Jim is a single-dad widower who’s been raising his only child, Jenni (Geraldine Viswanathan of Blockers and 2020’s Bad Education), since she was 6 years old. Their father-daughter connection is so close as to become a running joke, with the pair immediately short-circuiting any hint of potential conflict with a demonstration of cooing affection. When Jenni announces she’s marrying her boyfriend (Stony Blyden), Jim represses his fears of abandonment by springing into superdad mode, immediately booking them a wedding weekend at the Palmetto House, a tiny hotel on an island in the state of Georgia where he and his late wife married years ago. The trouble is that unbeknownst to Jim, the elderly innkeeper who answers his phone call drops dead before she can find a working pen to write his name down—a pitch-dark sight gag of the sort this often treacly comedy could have used more of.\n\nWitherspoon’s Margot is a trickier piece of work, a tightly wound reality-TV producer in L.A. who’s semi-estranged from her Atlanta-based family because of a prickly relationship with her judgmental mother (Celia Weston). Still, Margot adores her younger sister Neve (Meredith Hagner of Search Party and Bad Monkey), so when she learns Neve is both engaged to a dimwitted but adoring Chippendales dancer (American Vandal’s Jimmy Tatro) and secretly pregnant with his child, Margot is determined to go all in on planning the perfect wedding for her baby sis. Guess which remote island resort she chooses to reserve for the blessed event? That’s right, the Palmetto House, where both families converge on the first weekend in June for what each party believes will be a private family gathering.\n\nAfter some negotiation with the inn’s anxious manager (an underutilized Jack McBrayer), the two clans agree to share the limited space by staggering their planned events so as not to overlap. The shenanigans that unfold over the next few double-booked days should be predictable to anyone who’s seen a romantic comedy set at a wedding. At some point, an elaborately tiered cake will crash to the ground. A collapsing dock will dunk dressed-to-the-nines attendees in water. A pair of guests will perform a sappy pop song (here, Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton’s country-inflected duet “Islands in the Stream”) that gets reprised by the whole cast under the closing credits, just as happened last year with Natasha Bedingfield’s “Unwritten” in the unpleasant yet successful rom-com Anyone But You. And while everyone may not end up with exactly the partner they thought they were fated for, family rifts will be healed, long-suppressed hurts will be tearfully confessed, and, at least in this one case, live alligators will be wrestled in hotel-room beds, for reasons that are never entirely clear to either the characters or the audience.\n\nThe best moments in You’re Cordially Invited come in its middle section, when Jim and Margot have dug into their battle positions and sworn to one-up each other both as event organizers and as the emotional caretakers of their respective brides. Even when they’re working from a less than sparkling script, Ferrell and Witherspoon’s enormous reserves of movie-star charisma, and their shared flair for playing characters who are as comically self-absorbed as they are sure of their own moral righteousness, make their bouts of dance-floor sparring and top-this wedding toasts genuinely funny. Stoller understands, too, that no wedding comedy could work without a supporting cast of endearingly terrible relatives, so he gives Margot an extended family that includes Leanne Morgan as a perpetually drunk and horny sister, Rory Scovel as a knuckle-dragging brother, and best of all, Celia Weston, stealing every scene she’s in as a hypercritical Southern matriarch whose barbed exterior conceals unexpected maternal warmth.\n\nSadly, You’re Cordially Invited eventually founders on the same rocky shores as many recent attempts to revive the rom-com. In its final act, as the interweaving strands of nuptial chaos begin to resolve into a détente among the newlyweds and their families, Jim and Margot somewhat abruptly emerge as romantic partners themselves. While the age distance between the two is not enormous—Ferrell is 57 to Witherspoon’s 48—there is a curious wrongness to these two as a couple, especially given their characters as previously established in the movie. Jim, we have been shown in scene after scene, is an over-enmeshed father who badly needs some time on his own to figure out who he is. Margot, for her part, is a happily busy career woman who has never evinced any sign of dissatisfaction with her single status. Pairing them up at the end as lovebirds mutually crooning the very same song that was earlier used as an example of Jim and his daughter’s quasi-incestuously codependent relationship leaves the viewer with a claustrophobic sense that coupledom is the only conceivable happy ending.\n\nWhat if Jim and Margot had ended up as close but bickering friends, continuing to one-up each other via text about their respective brides’ ongoing blissfulness? Or what if they had slept together in a moment of Champagne-fueled folly, only to realize the next morning that though they might not be a viable long-term match, at least they would always have that night at the Palmetto House? For the romantic comedy to continue to evolve as a genre, an outcome every film fan seems to want, we need more viable paths to happy-ever-afterness than the Shakespearean model of marrying off every character in the last scene. If You’re Cordially Invited merits your RSVP—and for die-hard fans of the genre, it might—it’s because of the comic chemistry between its dueling event planners. But does every bickering couple in a wedding rom-com need to end up as the figures on top of the cake?",

    "authors": ["Heather Schwedel"],
    "raw_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nIf you have no idea what to make of the Justin Baldoni–Blake Lively situation anymore, that’s partly by design. The past couple of weeks have been a perfect illustration of how confusing and removed from reality the case has become. Last week, Baldoni’s legal team released some supposedly unedited footage from the filming of It Ends With Us that, it would have you believe, proves once and for all that Baldoni, the film’s director and star, didn’t sexually harass his co-star. Funnily enough, Lively’s team seems to agree that the video is damning—only that it incriminates him, not her.\n\nThese leaks, which also now include a voice note Baldoni is said to have sent Lively at 2 a.m. during filming, are the latest developments in a saga that kicked into high gear last month, when Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni and others behind the 2024 drama. It was covered prominently in the New York Times the day after the filing, meaning Lively’s side likely coordinated with the paper to some degree; this collaboration has sparked some conspiratorial thinking online. Since then, the parties have been trading blows: Baldoni sued the Times for $250 million, and Lively officially sued the actor as well. After a short period of implying that he also planned to sue Lively “into oblivion,” Baldoni’s lawyer Bryan Freedman did just that two weeks ago, filing a $400 million suit against the actress and adding her husband, Ryan Reynolds, for good measure. At this point, the combined pages of publicly available legal filings are now about the length of the 380-page Colleen Hoover novel that inspired the film at the heart of this whole mess.\n\nLively’s original legal complaint alleged that Baldoni and the team behind It Ends With Us created a sexually inappropriate atmosphere on the set of the movie, then, as retaliation for Lively speaking out against it, hired a crisis communications team to attempt to smear her reputation. The Times’ report on the initial action quoted generously from Lively’s legal filing, which included text messages and emails that purportedly showed some of the inner workings of the crisis campaign. Baldoni and Co. denied any harassment and said the New York Times’ reporting cherry-picked its facts and excerpts. His complaints allege that the real scandal of the movie shoot was the way Lively attempted to wrest creative control of the movie away from him and his team.\n\nPublic reception of the whole situation has followed a telling, and potentially troubling, arc. The initial Times story made a splash and seemed to bring recognition from some that they’d been duped by the smear campaign Lively was alleging. But Baldoni’s two lawsuits and other public volleys against Lively, including the video footage his side has now released, have undoubtedly been successful in chipping away at that. As Doreen St. Félix wrote for the New Yorker, the era in which #MeToo stories have the power to definitively move the cultural needle may be over, and for various reasons, the skepticism surrounding Lively in particular is widespread.\n\nIn practice, what I’ve found this looks like is that now, every time there’s a new update in the case, I am served a bunch of videos on TikTok by armchair legal experts who claim to have analyzed the relevant evidence before making pronouncements like “Sorry, but this girl just keeps digging herself into a hole that I cannot dig her out of” and “Blake Lively is cooked! She is coo-ooked!” I occasionally see videos that appear to take Lively’s side, or even try to be neutral, but those seem to be far outnumbered by the veritable army of Baldoni supporters.\n\nThis was all silly enough when what was being chewed over were mainly details from various legal filings, such as allegations that Lively’s side omitted a crucial emoji from some of the text-message evidence. Baldoni’s side and his supporters were stretching the definition of exculpatory in fairly transparent ways. Last week, though, we arrived at the surreal but inevitable point when both sides were watching the same footage and arguing that it means completely opposite things. The footage in question is from a scene Lively specifically cited in her original legal complaint. Here is how she describes it:\n\nOn another occasion, Mr. Baldoni and Ms. Lively were filming a slow dance scene for a montage in which no sound was recorded. Mr. Baldoni chose to let the camera roll and have them perform the scene, but did not act in character as Ryle; instead, he spoke to Ms. Lively out of character as himself. At one point, he leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, “it smells so good.” None of this was remotely in character, or based on any dialogue in the script, and nothing needed to be said because, again, there was no sound—Mr. Baldoni was caressing [Ms.] Lively with his mouth in a way that had nothing to do with their roles. When Ms. Lively later objected to this behavior, [Mr.] Baldoni’s response was, “I’m not even attracted to you.”\n\nBaldoni’s side’s description of the scene is longer, on Pages 53 and 54 of his suit against Lively. His lawyers argue that the scene was not shot in character at least in part because Lively—as herself, not her character, Lily—kept arguing that the two should appear to be talking while filming. The complaint says, in part:\n\nLively continued to break character and speak as herself rather than as Lily, which was extremely confusing for Baldoni, who was trying to balance directing the scene within his artistic vision while also acting in character while filming and trying to get Lively to do the same. Lively apologized for the smell of her spray tan and body makeup. Baldoni responded, “It smells good,” and continued acting, slow dancing as he believed his character would with his partner, which requires some amount of physical touching. Lively took them out of character again and began to joke about Baldoni’s nose, which he laughed off and joked in turn, even as Lively joked that he should get plastic surgery.\n\nBaldoni’s side released the footage with a title card that says it “clearly refute[s]” Lively’s claim that Baldoni was behaving inappropriately: “Both actors are clearly behaving well within the scope of the scene and with mutual respect and professionalism.” Then Lively’s team released a statement in response asserting that the footage only corroborates her complaint.\n\nWhat does the footage actually show? Perhaps it does complicate Lively’s description in some ways: It includes sound, for one thing, which immediately calls her description into question even if it doesn’t ultimately change the substance of what she was saying. Her claim that Baldoni wasn’t acting in character is also odd, considering that she wasn’t either. But Lively clearly looks as if she is trying to avoid kissing Baldoni at points in the clip, and, as her side argued in a statement, her being so chatty could have been one way of trying to ward off Baldoni’s behavior. (An intimacy coordinator interviewed in the Hollywood Reporter, when informed that the Baldoni camp was claiming that the footage vindicated the actor, responded: “I see the opposite.”) It’s impossible to tell by the footage what is happening in either person’s head, and for that reason, the video doesn’t do much definitively for either side.\n\nLively’s side has accused Baldoni’s of attempting to manipulate the public by releasing the video and other material to the media instead of waiting for the trial, and the team has now requested a gag order. I lack the legal training to know whether Lively and Co. should prevail, but all I can say is: Please, do it. If not, it will all never end. (Isn’t the movie’s title starting to seem like a curse?) To wit, this week brought us the aforementioned voice note, in which Baldoni apologizes to Lively over his reaction to some changes to a scene. Whether that particular voice note makes Baldoni seem like a good guy who was trying to get it right or makes you want to jump out of your skin and flee any part of society where you might ever encounter Baldoni or his voice again, as it did for some of my colleagues, depends on you. But it really proves nothing for either side.\n\nIt would seem that Baldoni recorded the voice note in response to some text messages from Lively—included in one of his lawsuits—in which she compared to herself to Khaleesi, the Game of Thrones character, and talked about how her friend Taylor Swift was one of her dragons. That’s patently bananas. The details in this case are head-turning and often amusing to discuss, and Baldoni’s camp knows this. His team has even been teasing the launch of a website that will supposedly contain “all correspondence” and relevant videos from the case so fans can judge for themselves. Yeah, right. So far, all that’s been proved is that even when fans don’t have enough information to judge for themselves, they’ll draw the wrong conclusions. People aren’t trying to interpret evidence anymore; they’re taking a Rorschach test, and they’re finding that every single inkblot somehow resembles Lively behaving bitchily. The issue of the gag order won’t be officially heard until a hearing on Monday, but by the power vested in me by your reading this far, I hereby grant the order. Consider yourself gagged.",

    "title": "Trump Is Trying to Make It Illegal to Help a Trans Child",
    "authors": ["Christina Cauterucci"],
    "raw_text": "This week, Donald Trump signed a slew of executive orders designed to make it difficult for transgender people to participate in public life with safety and dignity. Two of them make good on the president’s promise to prioritize the targeting of transgender children, and together they attempt to dissolve the support structures that help trans kids thrive.\n\nThe first will make it harder for minors to access gender-affirming care: Federal insurance programs like Medicaid and the health plans of federal employees will no longer cover treatments like puberty blockers and hormone therapy for people under the age of 19. Any medical institutions that receive federal grants for research or education will have to stop providing this type of care to transgender kids and teenagers, too.\n\nThe second executive order will end federal funding for schools that support transgender students. This could include putting trans subject matter in lesson plans, having policies that ensure teachers use trans kids’ correct pronouns, or allowing them to use bathrooms aligned with their gender identities. It directs the U.S. attorney general to work with state attorneys general and local district attorneys to investigate and prosecute teachers who affirm trans students’ identities under laws that prohibit the sexual exploitation of children and the practice of medicine without a license.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether these orders will hold up in court—and, if they do, what impact they might have state by state and institution by institution. There are good legal arguments against them on the grounds of equal protection—especially since the first executive order will not halt insurance coverage of puberty blockers and hormones for cisgender children—and advocates say the Department of Education cannot dictate school curriculum.\n\nBut however the logistics shake out, the executive orders will have an immediate chilling effect on medical professionals and educators, who are now grappling with the knowledge that helping trans kids could lead to their own prosecution. The Trump administration is successfully attempting to make it illegal or unsustainable to be a supportive adult in a transgender child’s life.\n\nThe trans kids who will be affected by this week’s directives are likely the lucky ones in America right now. They either live in states where pediatric gender-affirming care is legal, or they have the resources to travel across state lines to get it. They have supportive parents or guardians who have provided the required consent for their medical treatment. Their schools allow them to live full, integrated lives, and their teachers discourage bullying by setting a standard of affirmation for trans students. Even with all the hardships trans kids face in a moment of nationwide transphobic backlash, these are the ones with the best foundations for happy, healthy lives.\n\nMany trans children across the country don’t have that kind of support. It’s hard to even put numbers to the impact that a network of caring adults and peers can have on a child’s life, but researchers have tried. Studies have shown that acceptance from parents, teachers, health care professionals, and classmates are all associated with lower rates of suicide attempts among transgender youth. Other research has found an association between access to gender-affirming medical treatments in childhood or adolescence and a lower risk of suicidality and improved mental health through adulthood.\n\nEven before Trump took office, red states were investigating parents for child abuse for providing their kids with the medical treatment they need to feel comfortable and whole in their bodies. With these new orders, the places where trans youth have a chance of growing up with the same support and resources as their cisgender peers are likely to dwindle further. The GOP’s vision for the country, which Trump is now carrying out, is one in which adults across the country who want to help the trans kids in their lives thrive will have to break the law to do so. We’ve already seen how that goes with abortion providers.\n\nUntil a few years ago, the prospects for transgender youth with supportive parents were looking up. There was a glimpse of a brighter future ahead—a hope that many trans kids wouldn’t have to grow up with the childhood trauma that was the norm for trans people who came of age in earlier decades. Instead, they could get medical treatments that prevented gender dysphoria, experience validation from trusted adults, and engage in social life as their full selves.\n\nThat future is slipping away. Teachers who went into the profession to foster the development of curious, empathetic, confident young people will now find themselves forcibly aligned with classroom bullies. Parents who would do anything to give their kids the best shot at a stable and joyful life will now be helpless in the face of the law, made to witness their precious children suffer preventable distress and possibly undergo the excruciating process of medical detransition. It’s hard enough to be a trans kid, even with the full support of adults in your life. The Trump administration is dead set on making it harder.",

    "title": "Cameron Brink Discusses the Challenges of Watching Unrivaled and Olympic 3x3 Basketball from the Sidelines",
    "authors": ["TOI Sports Desk"],
    "raw_text": "In June 2024, Cameron Brink suffered an ACL injury, halting her debut in the 3x3 basketball league and the Paris Olympics. Despite the setback, she remains actively involved with her team, the Lunar Owls, providing support and encouragement. Brink's dedication continues, even as she faces challenges from media inquiries about her absence from the court.\n\n(Image Source - Getty Images)\n\nCameron Brink was all set to kick off a new journey with Unrivaled, but a heartbreaking ACL injury in June 2024 crushed her hopes of making her debut in the 3x3 basketball league and competing in the Paris Olympics. Now, as she cheers from the sidelines, Brink opens up about how tough it’s been to miss out on this exciting form of basketball. Even with her injury, she stays involved with the Lunar Owls , providing support and encouragement to her teammates.\n\nUnrivaled League's 2025 Season Kicks Off with Brink's Anticipated Return in 2026\n\nIn June 2024, Cameron Brink suffered a serious setback when she tore her ACL during a game against the Connecticut Sun. This injury put a damper on her first WNBA season and crushed her hopes of competing in the 3x3 basketball event at the Paris Olympics. She had just inked a multi-year contract with Unrivaled and was pumped to be part of the Lunar Owls team, ready to take on this new adventure. Sadly, the ACL injury means she’ll be sidelined, unable to participate in the 3x3 league that she was so eager to join.\n\nCameron Brink mentioned that watching from the sidelines has been tough for her. She finds it even harder than missing out on the WNBA season and thinks it might be because she also missed the 3-on-3 format at the Olympics. For Brink, it’s not just about being away from the game; this injury has kept her from a whole different kind of basketball that she loves.\n\nBrink Remains an Active Force for Lunar Owls Despite Injury\n\nCameron Brink might not be able to play right now, but she's anything but a bystander. She's fully committed to her team, the Lunar Owls, and stays involved in every way she can. Brink keeps close ties with her teammates, who she describes as being “obsessed” with one another. Her energy is infectious, and she’s always there to cheer them on. Whether she’s at practices or celebrating their wins on social media, Brink embodies what it means to be a true team player.\n\nYou can see how tight-knit Brink is with the Lunar Owls team. She's always cheering them on, both during games and outside of them. When Skylar Diggins-Smith nailed that game-winning three-pointer, Brink was right there, shouting “big momma” in excitement. At Unrivaled Media Day, her energy was contagious as she sunk a half-court shot and celebrated with a dance before giving Diggins-Smith a big hug.\n\nMedia Questions About Brink's Absence from the Court Left Her Feeling Uncomfortable\n\nBrink has had some cringeworthy encounters with the media while going through this difficult time. During a media event in Miami for Unrivaled, she felt pretty uneasy as reporters kept probing her about her lack of playtime. One reporter even asked, “What can you do, and why are you here?” Brink admitted that those questions got to her. As someone who’s quite sensitive, discussing her absence from the court especially when it’s not fully her decision was hard. “I just sat there and kind of lost it,” she revealed.\n\nWhether she’s rooting for the Lunar Owls or tackling her emotional challenges, Brink’s passion for the game is rock solid. She’s got her eyes set on what’s ahead, and this bump in the road will just fuel her comeback even more.\n\nAlso Read : Tyrese Maxey made his feelings known about his new role with the Sixers amid Joel Embiid’s absences: “I was upset early in the year”\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

Discontent grows among Cowboys fans as Jones' management style and team's lack of success continue to be scrutinized.\n\nImage via Imagn Images\n\nPreviously, former Cowboys player, Ross Tucker defended Jerry Jones as a businessman, risk-taker, and decision-maker. However, he is no longer leading the Jerry Jones fan club. He now appears to be watching an aging relative make questionable choices at Thanksgiving dinner, akin to someone watching an aging relative make questionable choices.\n\nRoss Tucker expresses concerns over Jerry Jones' media appearances\n\nA decade ago, Ross Tucker was a strong supporter of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, lauding his decisiveness and responsibility in decision-making. \"The buck stops with him,\" Tucker said back then.But today, Tucker's tone has altered.\n\nMike Florio: Jerry Jones' FUTURE & when will the NFL EXPAND to 18 games?\n\nNow, he comes across as someone apprehensively observing a senior relative make questionable choices. \"I get nervous now when he talks to the media,\" Tucker admitted.\"There's an age where I wouldn't want my grandpa talking publicly to anyone.\"\n\nThis season has been challenging for Cowboys fans, and Jones' choices have faced intense criticism.In the offseason, he declared, \"All-in. All-in. All-in. We're all-in with these young guys. We're all-in with this draft.\" Fans were hopeful until the season began.\n\nThe \"all-in\" mindset resulted in yet another letdown, as Dallas finished 7-10 and missed the playoffs. Following a loss to the Texans that dropped the team to 3-7, Jones looked back on 1989, saying, \"We won one game my first year.\" Nostalgia may be comforting, but it doesn't change the fact that the team is faltering now.\n\nThen there's the notorious sun problem at AT&T Stadium. The blinding glare has made simple plays nearly unmanageable, with star receiver CeeDee Lamb admitting, \"I couldn’t see the ball,\" after a pivotal drop. When asked if curtains could solve the issue, Lamb responded, \"One thousand percent.\" But Jones brushed off the suggestion, joking, \"Let's just tear the damn stadium down and build another one. Are you kidding me?\"Because, evidently, curtains are more difficult than erecting a new stadium.\n\nFollowing a Week 18 defeat to the Commanders, Jones made a remark that had fans wondering if he's truly in touch with reality. When asked if he'd ever consider stepping down from his GM position, he responded,\"No. Just, no. I bought an occupation, and I bought something I was going to do for the rest of my life. That's what I'm doing.\"\n\nFans expected major moves, like signing Derrick Henry or making trades, but Jones opted to maintain the status quo. Although the Cowboys did make some changes, like firing Mike McCarthy and hiring Brian Schottenheimer, Jones' continued influence leaves little room for optimism. \"Since I have to decide where the money is spent, then you might as well cut all of the bullsh-t out. That's who's making the call anyways,\" Jones said.\n\nAlso Read: Can the Chiefs afford to retain Trey Smith and Nick Bolton? There future remains uncertain, with the Super Bowl potentially marking their last in the uniform\n\nIt’s unclear how much more Cowboys fans can tolerate under Jerry Jones' leadership. The constant frustration with team decisions, questionable management, and lack of postseason success has worn on many fans. While Jones' boldness has brought attention and success in certain moments, the growing criticism suggests that fans are reaching their limit, questioning whether fresh leadership might be needed to turn the franchise around.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Mitchell Robinson's future with the Knicks is uncertain due to his injury recovery, prompting trade considerations. The Knicks, strong in the Eastern Conference, are evaluating trade options like Matisse Thybulle to enhance their defense and sustain their successful run.\n\n(Image Source - Getty Images)\n\nMitchell Robinson's future with the New York Knicks is uncertain as the team aims to build on their solid start this season. Even though he's recovering from foot surgery he had in May, the Knicks are currently in a strong third place in the Eastern Conference. With trade rumors buzzing, the front office is weighing all possibilities to enhance the squad. Will Robinson's injury lead to a trade, or is he set to come back and make a significant impact for the Knicks?\n\nPhoenix Suns Potentially Eyeing Mitchell Robinson in Knicks' Trade Talks\n\nMitchell Robinson, who’s 26 and was drafted by the Knicks in 2018, has been a solid defensive player for the team. Sadly, he’s still sidelined this season after having foot surgery in May. According to head coach Tom Thibodeau, Robinson isn’t practicing yet and has just started to get back into running and jumping.\n\nEven without Robinson, the Knicks have been doing great, boasting a 32-16 record and sitting in third place in the Eastern Conference. This success has led the front office to look into trade possibilities to boost the team even more. They’re apparently considering trading Robinson, who will make $14.3 million this season and $12.9 million next season.\n\nKnicks Exploring Defensive Options with Matisse Thybulle on Their Radar\n\nSeveral players have emerged as potential trade targets for the Knicks.\n\nJonas Valanciunas: Valanciunas, a seasoned center with the Washington Wizards, brings solid scoring and rebounding to the table. But with his age and the Knicks facing stiff competition for him, especially from the Lakers, things could get tricky.\n\nJae'Sean Tate: Tate, a flexible forward with the Houston Rockets, could really boost their wing depth and help out on defense. The Rockets might be open to trading him for some second-round picks.\n\nMatisse Thybulle: Thybulle, a wing player known for his defensive skills with the Portland Trail Blazers, could really boost the Knicks' defense.\n\nIsaiah Stewart: A hefty player from the Detroit Pistons, has some potential, but he might not be the best match for what the Knicks are looking for right now.\n\nAfter having surgery in December for an earlier ankle issue, he ended up injuring himself again. This setback caused Robinson to miss around 50 games. Then in May, he had a second surgery to fix a stress fracture, which has kept him out at the start of the current season.\n\nAs the trade deadline nears, the New York Knicks are busy assessing their roster and weighing their options for trades to improve their squad. The status of Mitchell Robinson's injury and his possible return will have a major impact on the team's choices. The Knicks are looking to boost their lineup, whether through trades or getting Robinson back, to keep up in the Eastern Conference.\n\nAlso Read : Joel Embiid’s handstand stunt viral video draws mixed reactions from former NBA players\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Terry Rozier is under federal investigation for allegedly underperforming during a March 2023 game to influence betting outcomes. Despite the NBA finding no violations, suspicious bets and his early exit from the game have prompted a broader inquiry into potential match-fixing in professional basketball.\n\n(Image Source - Getty Images)\n\nTerry Rozier , the experienced NBA guard currently with the Miami Heat, is under federal scrutiny for allegedly tweaking his performance in a March 2023 game between the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans . This investigation is part of a larger look into match-fixing in basketball, which has already resulted in the conviction of ex-Raptors player Jontay Porter. Could Rozier be tangled up in this situation as well?\n\nSuspicious Bets and Early Exit Raise Questions About Terry Rozier's Role in Match-Fixing\n\nOn March 23, 2023, a matchup between the Charlotte Hornets and the New Orleans Pelicans caught attention, not just for the game itself but also due to some questionable betting activity involving Terry Rozier. Reports indicated that there were some unusual bets placed on Rozier's performance that evening, which led U.S. Integrity, a group focused on combating illegal gambling, to take notice. As a result, several sportsbooks stopped taking bets on Rozier, raising even more red flags.\n\nRozier, who was with the Hornets back then, had to leave the game after only nine minutes due to a sore right foot. His stats were pretty lackluster, showing just five points, four rebounds, two assists, and one foul, which is surprising for someone of his talent. This raised eyebrows among gamblers on social media, with one person pointing out how strange it was that Rozier played so little and left so early. Before long, rumors about possible match-fixing started to swirl.\n\nNBA Finds No Violations in Rozier Case But Federal Inquiry Continues\n\nThe NBA looked into the situation themselves and didn’t find any rule-breaking. However, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York decided to start their own investigation. The league is fully on board with this inquiry, but so far, Rozier hasn’t faced any charges, and it’s still uncertain if there’s any solid proof connecting him to the betting stuff.\n\nThis investigation is part of a larger inquiry into suspected match-fixing in professional basketball. The scandal has already drawn in Jontay Porter, a former NBA player who admitted to deliberately underperforming in games to assist gamblers.\n\nWhat makes Porter’s situation stand out is that federal investigators found text messages exchanged during games between him and his supposed partners, outlining his strategy to leave games early to influence betting results.\n\nEven though there’s no solid proof that Terry Rozier is involved in any illegal gambling, the federal investigation definitely puts a spotlight on the integrity of pro basketball. With the inquiry still going on, both the NBA and federal officials are keeping a close eye on things to make sure the game stays clean. Fans and players are on edge, waiting to see what happens next in this big case.\n\nAlso Read : DeMarcus Cousins slams Suns center Jusuf Nurkic over comments about head coach: “It’s kind of foolish on his part\"\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

Campanile, previously with the Green Bay Packers, brings a proven defensive track record to improve the Jaguars' consistently underperforming defense rankings.\n\n(Image Via Getty)\n\nThe whole point of becoming a head coach is realizing what your team needs the most. That’s what Jacksonville Jaguars ' new head coach, Liam Coen did. He knows that the Jaguars’ defense has been vanquishing, so he took up their case and remedied it. He remedied the case by hiring an aggressive defensive coordinator called Anthony Campanile .\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars’ defense has been ranked 31st in 2024, 22nd in 2023, 14th in 2022, and 28th in 2021\n\nWhat's Wrong with the Jaguars Defense?\n\nThe Jaguars’ defensive coordinator in 2021 was Joe Cullen; in 2022 and 2023 was Mike Caldwell, and now, in 2024, it was Ryan Nielsen. It has been consistently ranked in the 20s under the guidance of coach Doug Pederson and other defensive coordinators. The new head coach for the Jaguars, Liam Coen, paid exact and pressing heed to this issue. Coen’s brought the best aggressive defensive coordinator to change the defense weather in his team!\n\nJaguars coach Liam Coen released a statement. It read: “Anthony Campanile represents exactly what we want to be as a defensive unit and football team.”\n\nLiam Coen shared in a team statement,\n\n“Anthony Campanile represents exactly what we want to be as a defensive unit and football team. He brings an aggressive defensive mindset and a system that is adaptable to our players and allows them to play fast and physical.”\n\nJaguars hire first-time defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile to lead defense\n\nAnthony Campanile was Green Bay Packers linebackers coach and running back coordinator\n\nWhile everybody is busy switching from the defensive/offensive coordinator position to the head coach position, like Jacksonville Jaguars’ current head coach, Liam Coen did (Coen was the offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Rams), there is someone who got switched to a defensive coordinator position from some other position.\n\nAnd that someone is 42-year-old Anthony Campanile; he was Green Bay Packers linebackers coach and running back coordinator in the year 2024. Campanile allowed only 99.4 rushing yards a game there.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean Anthony Campanile doesn’t garner defensive coordinator skills\n\nAnthony was the defensive coordinator for Don Bosco Prep (New Jersey) between 2007 and 2009, defensive assistant at Rutgers between 2012 and 2013, defensive backs coach at Boston College between 2016 and 2017, and co-defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach at Boston College in 2018. It would be Anthony’s 6th NFL season and first as the defensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nAlso Read : Super Bowl LIX: Every major movie trailers dropping during the big game\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

The Super Bowl LIX is set for February 9, 2025, at Caesars Superdome. Taylor Swift is expected to be there, making the event highly anticipated for both sports and personal moments.\n\nCredit: Getty Images\n\nAs the Kansas City Chiefs edge closer to a historic Super Bowl three-peat, the excitement surrounding Super Bowl LIX has reached an all-time high. With Travis Kelce and his team gearing up for their showdown against the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9, 2025, at Caesars Superdome, fans are buzzing over not just the game, but also a potential off-field spectacle.\n\nTaylor Swift, expected to be in attendance to support her boyfriend, has fueled speculation that the night could hold more than just a championship celebration. Many people believe Travis may propose to Taylor if the Chiefs win the Super Bowl. Given their year-long romance, the rumors of Kelce popping the question have only intensified, adding another layer of drama to the most anticipated sporting event in the U.S. With oddsmakers even factoring in the possibility of an engagement, this Super Bowl promises to be unforgettable—both for football and for love.\n\nTravis Kelce’s Marriage Proposal to Taylor Swift? Betting Markets Set Odds for Super Bowl LIX Moment!\n\nAs the Kansas City Chiefs set their sights on a historic three-peat, all eyes are not just on the game but also on Travis Kelce’s personal life. With the Super Bowl around the corner, speculation is running high about whether Kelce will seize the moment to propose to his superstar girlfriend, Taylor Swift. Fans and oddsmakers alike are buzzing over the possibility, adding another layer of intrigue to the biggest night in football.\n\nOddsmakers have taken notice of the swirling speculation, with sportsbooks offering novelty bets on whether Kelce will pop the question if the Chiefs emerge victorious. According to the New York Post, FanDuel has placed the odds of a proposal at +750, translating to an 11.76% chance. This means that a $10 bet on Kelce proposing would yield a $75 return if it happens. Conversely, the odds of him not proposing stand at -1500, strongly suggesting that bookmakers believe the moment may not unfold on the field.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, betting on celebrity-driven moments like this has become a popular trend, making the Super Bowl not just a championship showdown but also a spectacle of high-profile entertainment. The hype surrounding Kelce and Swift’s relationship fuels further engagement, with fans eagerly awaiting any potential grand gestures.\n\nAre Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Ready for the Next Step in Their Relationship?\n\nReports have previously indicated that Kelce and Swift are open to the idea of engagement, though there is no urgency on Swift’s part. The couple, who began dating in the summer of 2023, have been under constant media scrutiny, with every gesture analyzed for hidden meaning.\n\nRecently, Swift was spotted wearing an infinity ring in New York City, sparking speculation among fans. While an infinity ring does not traditionally symbolize engagement, it has led some to believe that a proposal could be imminent. However, even if Kelce has plans to take their relationship to the next level, several logistical challenges could complicate an on-field proposal.\n\nFor one, Swift watches games from a private luxury suite, meaning she would need to make her way down to the field amid heavy security and postgame celebrations. Last year, when the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Swift made it to the field but was not part of the official broadcast celebrations. Whether she could join Kelce quickly enough for such a moment remains uncertain.\n\nA Star-Studded Super Bowl Weekend\n\nWhile fans speculate about Kelce’s potential proposal, Swift has been making her own plans for the big game. According to The U.S. Sun, she has invited several high-profile friends to join her, ensuring that the night will be nothing short of legendary. \"It promises to be one hell of a party, and invites are on their way to a bunch of their high-rolling pals,\" the report stated. Among those expected to attend are actress Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Ice Spice, Selena Gomez, and Benny Blanco.\n\nOver the past several months, Kelce and Swift have openly supported each other. Kelce remarked, \"She loves coming to Arrowhead [Stadium] and coming to the games and cheering for me,\" highlighting how their relationship has blended sports and celebrity culture. Swift was also seen enthusiastically celebrating Kelce’s victory at the AFC Championship Game, further solidifying their dynamic as a power couple. Reports suggest that both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are open to the idea of engagement, but Swift is not in a rush.\n\nAlso Read: Super Bowl 59: Jason Kelce chooses between family and Philly loyalty, says \"whoever wins, I'm going to...\"\n\nAs the Super Bowl approaches, fans will be watching closely—not just for the on-field action but for what could be a headline-making romantic moment. With anticipation at an all-time high, this Super Bowl could deliver surprises that go beyond football, making it a night to remember for sports and entertainment fans alike.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

The Kansas City Chiefs, with Harrison Butker's 35-yard field goal and fourth-down stop, won the game 32-29 against the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship Game. This marked their third consecutive Super Bowl win.\n\nAt each of their home games this season- except for one that they missed-she has been there in the stands. They will be at her side in person on February 9 to watch the Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles in what would be the first three-peat by a team as Super Bowl champions in NFL history. And thanks to a report from the U.S. Sun, the public now knows who she will be bringing with her.\n\nTaylor Swift will be in attendance Super Bowl LIX with some A-list celebrities\n\nTaylor Swift will be in attendance at the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl LIX on February 9 in New Orleans. The pop star will invite a who's who of celebrities to her VIP suite for the biggest game of the season, according to a report from The U.S. Sun.\n\nBlake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, friends of Taylor Swift, will be sitting with her in her suite with Selena Gomez, Benny Blanco, Sabrina Carpenter, and Ice Spice. \"It promises to be one hell of a party, and a source close to the superstar couple has told The U.S. Sun that invites are on their way to a bunch of their high-rolling pals,\" read the report.\n\n\"The Cruel Summer star wants (Blake) Lively - who was at last year's Super Bowl in Las Vegas with the singer and is a close friend - and husband Reynolds, Ice Spice, Sabrina Carpenter, Selena Gomez, and Benny Blanco to be by her side in what promises to be an emotional night in NOLA.”\n\nDespite speculations that she had a dust-up with one of her A Single Man co-stars, Justin Baldoni, who filed a $400 million lawsuit claiming sexual harassment, retaliation and launching a media smear campaign against him, Swift has been the first to shoot down such rumors. Baldoni claimed further that Lively used her close friendship with Swift to bulldoze him into editing a scene in their movie.\n\n“Blake and Ryan have been talking with Taylor and Travis about it when they spent days together a couple of months ago,” a source told the Sun. “And they told them not to book anything for that time of the year and to get ready to go to New Orleans at the beginning of the year.\n\n“… This has been a conversation since the beginning of the season, but now Travis and the Chiefs have reached the Super Bowl, it’s time to get the preparations for the big game started.”\n\nAlso Read: Taylor Swift is rumoured to be distancing herself from Blake Lively and is solely focused on cheering for Travis Kelce in the Super Bowl LIX\n\nClose celebrity friends of Swift, such as Lively, Ice Spice, Ashley Avignone, Lana Del Rey, and Miles Teller and his wife Keleigh Teller, accompanied her to Super Bowl LVIII.

    "raw_text": "The king cobra, previously believed to be a single species, is now identified as a complex of four distinct species due to genetic and morphological distinctions. This apex predator, known for its diet of other snakes and remarkable hunting skills, has populations isolated by natural barriers across southern Asia and the Philippines.\n\nSerpents are not only interesting creatures due to their lengths but also because of their deadly venom and specially modified bodies that make them excellent hunters in their respective environments. While they can look frightening, they play an important role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems by controlling prey populations and being part of the food chain.\n\nIn the dense forests of southern Asia, stretching from India’s Western Ghats to the mangroves of the Philippines, resides a serpentine giant thta has left even mamba and bushmaster behind. Unlike other venomous snakes, which are agile and smaller in size over brute strength, the king cobra defies these norms.\n\nThis giant snake which is also an apex predator, can grow to an incredible 18–19 feet in length, making it the world's longest venomous snake . However, genetic and morphological studies have recently found that the king cobra is not a single species but rather a complex of four species and change the rankings of the world's longest venomous snakes\n\nThe king cobra has impressed scientists and enthusiasts of snakes since the earliest ages. Its long range stretches from the forests in India and Southeast Asia to mangroves of the Philippines. This snake is famous for its mind, for being fiercely territorial, and the deadly venom.\n\nKing cobra, on seeing a threat, gives an utmost dramatic display of defense, as it rears itself, spreads its hood wide and gives an ongoing deep growl-like hiss. Its swollen with venom and a single bite in large predators or other snakes can get paralysed, making it one of the most feared reptiles in the wild.\n\nOne of the most outstanding characteristics of a king cobra is its preference for diet. It mainly feeds on other snakes, including poisonous ones, that is why its scientific name was named Ophiophagus or \"snake-eater.\"\n\nWith this specialized diet and unique features, the king cobra became an iconic creature in the class of reptiles. Its strategy in hunting prey is calculated and precise, this reveala about its high-level intelligence and bodily strength, and it can bring down dangerous prey without much risk for itself.\n\nFor a long time, the king cobra was recognized as the world’s longest venomous snake, a single species with a vast geographic range. However, recent studies have revealed that this perception was incorrect. What was thought to be one species is actually a species complex—a group of closely related but genetically distinct species. DNA studies showed that these populations had evolved separately over time, while scientists observed physical variations in size, scale pattern, and color between groups. Natural barriers like mountains, rivers, and oceans kept these populations isolated, allowing them to develop into distinct species.\n\nThe king cobra, once considered a single species, is now recognized as a complex of four distinct species. The Northern King Cobra that spans from eastern Pakistan to Southeast Asia, has dark-edged yellow bands. The Western Ghats King Cobra, with smaller and unique pale bands, resides exclusively in southern India's Western Ghats. The Sunda King Cobra which inhabits the Malay Peninsula and surrounding islands, has a distinct colour that helps in rainforest camouflage. The Luzon King Cobra is isolated on Luzon Island, Philippines, showcasing unique genetic and physical traits, lacking pale body bands in adults.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "A massive asteroid, codenamed '2024 YR4', potentially poses a collision threat to Earth in December 2032. With a diameter similar to that of a football field, the asteroid's approach has prompted NASA and international agencies to closely monitor its trajectory due to its significant impact risk.\n\nThroughout Earth's history, our planet has faced numerous incidents where it has faced experiences of close encounters or asteroid hits where some of which have had significant impacts on the environment and life itself. These space rocks come in varied sizes from small pebbles to massive boulders, travelling through space.\n\nWhen an asteroid strikes the Earth, the consequences can be catastrophic, one of the most well-known example is the asteroid impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs around 66 million years ago.\n\nPossibility of a collision from an asteroid remains an evergreen issue for scientists and space agencies across the world. With the advancement of technology, astronomers can now track gigantic asteroid, said to be bigger than a football field, is rapidly hurtling towards the Earth and has a higher than average possibility of colliding with our planet in the year 2032. According to a research by the Abu Dhabi-based International Astronomy Center (IAC), the asteroid, codenamed '2024 YR4' will pass very close to the Earth in 2032, and carries a high chance of collision.\n\nNASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) had discovered the asteroid on 27 December, 2024. Estimated diameter is between 40 to 100 meters across; this is at least over twice the size of a cricket pitch and, at maximum, the entire length of a football field, according to IAC Vice-President and member of International Asteroid Warning Network, Shawkat Odeh.\n\nThe IAC Vice-President, and member of the International Asteroid Warning Network, Shawkat Odeh confirmed that this asteroid comes dangerously close to our planet. Discovery resulted in an increase in alertness across space agencies in different parts of the world, as a way to continue monitoring its path. The possible scenarios of such an impact within the scientific community have stirred much air of fear as people struggle with the uncertainty and risk associated with this cosmic interloper.\n\nWill the asteroid strike Earth?\n\nNASA and other international space agencies closely follow the path of 2024 YR4, scoring it 3 on the Torino scale. The scale assessing the risk in terms of asteroid impact and has a score of 3, indicating that there is a 1 in 77 (1.3%) chance of collision with Earth on December 22, 2032. The cumulative chance beyond 2032 is 1 in 71, or 1.4%. However, despite these seemingly low odds, the asteroid's magnitude and potential destruction cause for alarm.\n\nThe IAC report indicates that 2024 YR4 came closest to Earth on December 25 with a distance of about 829,000 kilometers. The next time it comes close to Earth is on December 17, 2028, and passes without posing the threat of a collision.However, its next flyby on December 22, 2032, presents a higher chance of impact, with Odeh emphasizing the potential danger due to the asteroid's sheer size.\n\nHow impactful will the asteroid be on India?\n\nCurrent data show that the asteroid will pass Earth at a distance of approximately 127,699 km or 79,348 miles on December 22, 2032, with an uncertainty of 1.408 million km or 0.87 million miles. The risk corridor stretches from the Pacific Ocean to South America, the Atlantic Ocean, central Africa, and northern India for potential impact locations. Shawkat Odeh noted that the asteroid is only observable for 34 days, which limits its visibility since it does not emit much light. He therefore called on observatories across the world to monitor this dangerous body in space closely.\n\nWhat is the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting the Earth?\n\nThe diameter of 2024 YR4 is estimated to be as large as the asteroid that caused the Tunguska event in Siberia in 1908. Scientists expect that the impact damage, if it occurs, would be local rather than global. The Tunguska event flattened an area of about 2,000 square kilometers of forest, uprooting 80 million trees with a force equivalent to 10-15 megatons of TNT.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "A viral video showcases a cat's unusual method of drinking water by placing her head under a running fountain, resulting in an adorably wet forehead. This unique behavior has amused viewers, with many sharing similar experiences. Despite cats generally disliking water, this clever feline's technique has captured the attention of pet lovers worldwide.\n\nIn a viral video that has captivated pet lovers online, a cat owner was left stunned after discovering the unique way their feline drinks water. Unlike the typical lap-and-sip method, this clever cat has devised an unexpected technique that has viewers both amused and amazed.\n\nFor weeks a cat’s owner was puzzled by the mysteriously wet forehead. From bathtub accidents to spilled water, she thought of every possibility but nothing fit the frame. As it turns out, this ingenious feline has an unusual way of drinking—she places her head beneath a running fountain, allowing the water to cascade down her forehead before licking it up from below.\n\nThe technique not only quenches the thirst but also leaves her with an adorably soggy \"hairstyle,\" much to the amusement of viewers. The video has garnered more than 2 million views since and the comment section is hilarious with people sharing their own stories. One user said, “I have the same fountain and my orange cat does the exactly same thing.” Another also chimed in, “I have a burnt orange car (a little void) and he is often freshly baptized from his fountain. They seem to love it!” It seems that this weird drinking habit is common among orange cats. A third user wrote, “Watering her brain cell to keep it sufficient”.\n\nKittens, like other young animals, have distinct hydration needs during their early development. In their first few weeks, they rely entirely on their mother’s milk or, for orphaned kittens, a specialized kitten formula to stay nourished and hydrated. Around three to four weeks of age, as they start transitioning to solid food, they also begin exploring water as a source of hydration.\n\nInitially, they may need gentle encouragement, such as offering water in a shallow dish or lightly wetting their paws to pique their curiosity. By the time they reach eight weeks old, most kittens have adapted to drinking water independently and no longer rely on milk for hydration.\n\nHowever, cats are infamous for hating water. This is generally because water makes their fur heavy and uncomfortable, and disrupts their ability to groom themselves effectively. Further, they also have a long evolutionary history of living in dry environments.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Jamal Robinson, an ex-Microsoft and Amazon techie, drastically saved 90% of his salary yearly, turning it into Rs 30 crore by age 39. Starting as a church janitor, he ascended through top tech firms, disciplined saving 30%, then up to 90%, to retire early. His $3.5 million assets highlight disciplined financial strategy.\n\nImagine saving almost your entire salary for years and converting it into a whopping Rs 30 crore. Sounds like a dream? Well, for an ex-Microsoft and Amazon techie, it's reality. This former employee of the tech giants adopted an unconventional way towards wealth building, banking on the power of disciplined saving. While most of us can't even save a fraction of our paycheck this man took it to the extreme and saved 90% every year for years. And that translated into a fortune most people have only heard of. Curious how he did that? Read on to find out the shocking secrets behind his impressive financial strategy and how his tech career played a pivotal role in his success.\n\nFrom church janitor to tech tycoon: How Jamal Robinson retired at 39 with Rs 30 crores\n\nAt 17, Jamal Robinson had a brazen dream: retire by 45. Little did he know, he would shatter that goal, six years ahead of schedule. At 39, Robinson had already saved an eye-popping $3.5 million (Rs 30 crore), living the early retirement dream most can only fantasize about. But how did he pull it off? The secret lay in his extreme discipline—saving an eye-popping 90% of his salary over the years.\n\nNot one to be handed silver spoons, Robinson's upbringing was with parents fighting financial difficulties. He had his first job as a janitor in the church when he was 14 years old. He had to work his way through college for computer engineering and then transitioned into tech after college. He skyrocketed from there to work at Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Intel.\n\nThrough sheer will, relentless saving, and an unshakeable vision, Robinson redefined what success looks like. His story is not only about financial freedom but also a testament to the fact that early retirement is no longer a pipe dream but rather a reality, achievable through grit, hard work, and vision.\n\nEx-techie of Amazon and Microsoft shows how saving 90% led to 30 crores\n\nJamal Robinson's story is one of inspiring financial prudence and focus on goals. Starting at a salary of $41,000, Robinson has worked his way up in the tech world step by step. What made him different, however, was not his increasing salary but his discipline in saving and investing. What started with saving 30% of his earnings soon grew to 50%, then 80%, and eventually 90%. The more he saved, the more determined he became to retire early.\n\nDespite his career in tech, specifically in generative AI, rocketing in his late 30s, Robinson was not derailed by the promise of a fat paycheck or career promotion. At age 39, he decided to retire, understanding that his frugal savings had already set up the foundation for financial independence .\n\nBy now, Robinson had been able to collect an almost $3.5 million portfolio of assets by his early retirement and used the 4% rule to sustain his lifestyle. This implies that with patience, smart saving, and a clear vision, early retirement is not a fantasy, but a reality.\n\nAlso Read: “Not kindness, it’s called dumbness”: Delhi man criticised for setting stray dogs free from surveillance van\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

Despite positive reviews and word of mouth, it fell short of the Rs 100 crore mark in its first week, achieving an estimated Rs 86.50 crore. Competition from other releases and working day drops influenced its box office performance.\n\nAkshay Kumar and Veer Pahariya's latest action drama, Sky Force , has concluded its first week in theatres. While the film enjoyed a strong run at the box office, it fell short of the anticipated Rs 100 crore mark.\n\nSky Force Movie Review\n\nReleased on January 24, 2025, to coincide with the Republic Day weekend, Sky Force received positive reviews and strong word-of-mouth for its portrayal of India's first airstrike during the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War. The favourable buzz around the film helped boost its modest opening day collection of Rs 12.25 crore to an estimated Rs 22 crore on Saturday. The film recorded its highest collection on the Republic Day holiday, earning Rs 28 crore.\n\nPoll\n\nDo You Prefer Watching Movies in Theaters or at Home?\n\nHome for Comfort and Convenience Theaters for the Big-Screen Experience\n\nFollowing the weekend surge, Sky Force was expected to cross the Rs 100 crore mark. However, its collections dropped to an estimated Rs 5-7 crore per day over the working week. On Thursday, the film recorded its lowest collection to date, estimated at Rs 5.25 crore. With this, its total box office earnings now stand at an estimated Rs 86.50 crore.\n\nFactors such as competition from other releases like Pushpa 2, Emergency, and Game Changer may have impacted its box office performance. Despite this, the film managed to hold its ground and attract a steady audience throughout the week.\n\nSky Force is set to face additional competition this weekend with the release of Shahid Kapoor's Deva. According to advance booking reports, Deva has sold around 75,000 tickets, generating an estimated Rs 1.75 crore in advance sales. The film is expected to open with collections in the range of Rs 5-10 crore.\n\nThis, in turn, leaves room for Sky Force to grow and secure another strong weekend at the box office, potentially crossing the Rs 100 crore milestone.\n\nDirected by Sandeep Kewlani and Abhishek Anil Kapur, Sky Force also features Sara Ali Khan and Nimrat Kaur in pivotal roles. If it surpasses the Rs 100 crore mark in its second week, it will become the first Hindi film of 2025 to achieve this feat.\n\nSky Force | Song- Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

Despite crossing the Rs.100 crore mark in the first week, the film faced a significant drop in collections in the subsequent weeks, especially due to competition from other films.\n\nRam Charan’s ‘Game Changer’ is close to completing its third week at the box office. The film after completing 20 days has collected Rs. 130.48 crore at the box office. It saw a business of Rs. 0.2 crore on Tuesday, which fell to Rs. 0.18 crore on Wednesday, according to the Sacnilk report.\n\nGame Changer Movie Review\n\nThe movie crossed the Rs.100 crore mark in its first week, but after that, there was a major drop. Though even after the opening the business was going down, it was in the club of crores. Even the controversy around the makers faking the box office numbers didn’t initially affect the earnings of the movie. However, on day 12, which was the movie’s second Tuesday, the movie couldn’t reach even a perfect crore, and from there it never touched the Rs.1 crore mark.\n\nNet collection of ‘Game Changer’ in India\n\nDay 1 [1st Friday]: Rs. 51 Cr\n\nDay 2 [1st Saturday]: Rs. 21.6 Cr\n\nDay 3 [1st Sunday]: Rs. 15.9 Cr\n\nDay 4 [1st Monday]: Rs. 7.65 Cr\n\nDay 5 [1st Tuesday]: Rs. 10 Cr\n\nDay 6 [1st Wednesday]: Rs.7 Cr\n\nDay 7 [1st Thursday]: Rs.4.5 Cr\n\nWeek 1 Collection: Rs. 117.65 Cr\n\nDay 8 [2nd Friday]: Rs. 2.65 Cr\n\nDay 9: [2nd Saturday]: Rs. 2.4 Cr\n\nDay 10 [2nd Sunday]: Rs. 2.6 Cr\n\nDay 11 [2nd Monday]: Rs. 1 Cr\n\nDay 12 [2nd Tuesady]: Rs. 0.9 Cr\n\nDay 13 [2nd Wednsday]: Rs.0.8 Cr\n\nDay 14 [2nd Thursday]: Rs.0.7 Cr\n\nWeek 2 Collection: Rs. 11.15 Cr\n\nDay 15 [3rd Friday]: Rs. 0.3 Cr\n\nDay 16: [3rd Saturday]: Rs. 0.33 Cr\n\nDay 17 [3rd Sunday]: Rs. 0.42 Cr\n\nDay 18 [3rd Monday]: Rs. 0. 25 Cr\n\nDay 19 [3rd Tuesday]: Rs. 0. 20 Cr\n\nDay 20 [3rd Wednsday]: Rs. 0.18 Cr (early estimates)\n\nTotal: Rs. 130.48 Cr\n\nIt is worth noting that as the movie faced competition from ‘Emergency’ and ‘Azaad’ the film lost the business.

(AI image)\n\nUnion Budget 2025 Expectations :Gold traders including jewellers and bullion sellers are looking forward to Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to outline a strategy aimed towards strengthening the Indian middle class’ ability to buy the precious metal. The dealers are awaiting the finance ministry’s nod for a mechanism that permits buying gold through EMI in the wake of staggering prices and allocating funds for upskilling the artisans. Additionally, they are also calling for a single regulator for the gold market which, at present, is regulated by SEBI, RBI, DGFT, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Commerce.\n\nSimilarly, Bullion traders have also been working on a delicate margin of 0.65 per cent over the past few years. Prithviraj Kothari, president of India Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA) suggested that this low margin could be increased by decreasing the import duties on gold dore.\n\nSuvankar Sen, MD & CEO of listed firm Senco Gold and Diamonds told ET that the gold industry had been providing employment to India’s youth and expert artisans and expressed hope for the upcoming budget to allocate funds for skilling of gold artisans, “prepare a mechanism that middle-class customers can buy jewellery through EMI, reduce the tax rates and bring in liquidity in the economy through infrastructural spending for jewellery and other sectors.”\n\nAlso Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Why standard deduction should be hiked under new tax regime\n\nSaurabh Gadgil, chairman and managing director of PNG Jewellers, noted that the upcoming Budget 2025 offers a chance to build on this momentum with well-designed policies and tax reforms that benefit the common man, ultimately driving demand and consumption.\n\nGadgil said, “Initiatives like further reductions in import duties, and strengthening gold monetisation schemes , can enhance efficiency and boost demand further.”\n\nThe success of recent jewellery industry IPOs highlight the sector's increasing compliance and credibility, paving the way to capital markets and inviting more participants to embrace organised practices.\n\nHe also mentioned that the industry's export potential, currently contributing 5 percent to India's total exports, can be further maximised through policies that optimise gold circulation and encourage sustainable practices, ultimately boosting jewellery exports.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "authors": ["TOI Business Experts"],
    "raw_text": "​​Budget 2025 income tax expectations: The article examines the potential scrapping of the old income tax regime in the upcoming Budget 2025. It highlights the introduction and progression of the new tax regime since 2020, comparing the benefits and drawbacks for various taxpayer categories.\n\nBudget 2025 income tax expectations: In the interim, the Government could consider announcing its roadmap of phasing out the old income tax regime.\n\nBy Ishita Sengupta\n\nBudget 2025 income tax expectations : As we all gear up for the Union Budget later this week, the big question for individual taxpayers is whether the Hon’ble Finance Minister will completely scrap the old tax regime ? Well, time will only give the answer but the moot question is – would it be prudent to do so?\n\nLet’s step back for a bit of analysis! The new income tax regime was introduced in 2020 as an optional regime for individual taxpayers. The primary objective was to introduce a more simplified tax structure by removing the plethora of deductions and exemptions. The Government also provided significant relief to taxpayers by reducing income-tax rates, thus nudging them to adopt the new income tax regime. It was quite apparent that the Government intended to phase out the old income tax regime in due course. As per media reports, there were very few takers of the new income tax regime in the initial years.\n\nTo give a further push, vide Finance Act, 2023, the Government made the new income tax regime as the default regime and brought more attractive changes related to the new income tax regime, by reducing the income-tax rates further, capping the maximum marginal rate (MMR) at 39%, introducing the standard deduction of ₹50,000 for salaried individuals, increasing the income level for 100% tax rebate etc. The trend even continued for the subsequent year wherein vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024, the slab rates were further tweaked for better, standard deduction for salaried individuals was hiked, deduction for employer’s NPS contribution increased by 4% etc. This seems to have worked its magic. As per Press Release issued by the Ministry of Finance on August 2, 2024, 72% taxpayers opted for the new income tax regime in FY 2023-24 ITRs filed until July 31, 2024.\n\nAlso Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Top personal tax changes on the wishlist\n\nWhile this appears to be a large percentage, one cannot disregard the fact that the 28% taxpayers opting for the old income tax regime in FY 2023-24 is still a considerable number. Furthermore, while we do not have the necessary data to understand clearly which section of taxpayers are still in favour of the old income tax regime, it is not difficult to guess. From salaried taxpayers’ perspective, the ones benefiting from popular tax exemptions and deductions such as, HRA, LTA, home loan interest, 80C deductions, insurance premia, charitable donations etc. would be still opting for old income tax regime.\n\nGiven this, is it worth evaluating if the lower tax rates under the new income tax regime really offset the tax deductions/ exemptions which taxpayers have to forego?\n\nWe have categorised individual taxpayers in four general baskets as per their annual gross income – (A) individuals having income up to ₹15 lakh, (B) individuals having income between ₹15 lakh - ₹1 Cr, (C) HNIs having income between ₹1 - ₹5 Cr and (D) ultra-HNIs having income beyond ₹5 Cr.\n\nAlso Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Why standard deduction should be hiked under new tax regime\n\nCategory A represents the largest filing population, possibly young salaried taxpayers, many of them millennials, who may not have invested in long term assets like house properties and other savings schemes. Hence, they would typically prefer hassle-free filing and less burden of documentation proof, etc. At the other end of the spectrum are the ultra-HNIs who would prefer the MMR currently capped at 39% in the new income tax regime due to surcharge cap vis-à-vis 42.74% in the old income tax regime. For both these categories, new income tax regime seems to be the clear winner.\n\nIt is the people in between who seem to make up the largest group as the old income tax regime filers. These individuals generally spend a significant part of their earnings and savings on rising house rent and home loan EMIs, children’s education, medical expenditure especially for their aged dependents and towards their own retirement savings. They also tend to donate to help a social cause. HNIs would comparatively spend, invest and donate more.\n\nThe available standard deduction against salary income is definitely not commensurate with the rising YoY expenses. The continuity of existing tax benefits under the old income tax regime hence becomes a critical part of their financial planning to meet their cash budgets. As more consequential tax savings would be available to individuals in Categories B and C and their MMR in both the regimes is the same, they would generally find the old income tax regime more attractive. It is also important to remember that many of these tax deductions, e.g., for home loan interest, insurance premia, savings schemes, etc. were originally introduced to give a boost to the related industry, by incentivising taxpayers to spend on them.\n\nIf discontinued, this could also have an adverse impact on such payee organisations and investee entities in meeting their objectives, fund requirements etc. In view of these, the Government should not rush to scrap the old income tax regime entirely, either in the existing income-tax law or the probable new Direct Tax Code, at least for a few more years till the average taxpayer develops the habit of prudent financial planning.\n\nIn the interim, the Government could consider announcing its roadmap of phasing out the old income tax regime coupled with an additional carrot of lower tax rates to encourage this middle-income group to voluntarily adopt the new income tax regime.\n\n(Authored by Ishita Sengupta, Partner and India Leader, Vialto Partners.

    "authors": ["TOI Entertainment Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Andy Cohen defends his probing of 'Real Housewives' stars about their cosmetic procedures, emphasizing its longstanding relevance to the show's appeal. Amid backlash, Cohen insists these discussions are a key aspect of the series, reflecting viewer interest and the cast's transparency about beauty enhancements.\n\nAndy Cohen is standing by his decision to ask ' Real Housewives ' stars about their cosmetic procedures , despite facing backlash from fans who find his approach intrusive. The ' Watch What Happens Live ' host argues that these discussions are deeply embedded in the DNA of the franchise and remain a topic of keen interest among viewers.\n\nCohen, 56, responded to the criticism via X (formerly Twitter) after a fan expressed frustration over his frequent inquiries about plastic surgery . The fan questioned the necessity of these conversations, arguing that they add little value to audiences. However, Cohen pushed back, emphasizing that these topics have been an integral part of the show since its inception.\n\n“‘What work have you had done?’ is consistently one of the most asked questions every season, across every franchise,” Cohen explained. “Since day one, the Housewives have openly shared their beauty routines, and it’s a major element of the show.”\n\nThe debate reignited during the Real Housewives of New York City Season 15 reunion when Cohen complimented cast member Jessel Taank on her refreshed look. “You look like an airbrushed version of yourself,” he remarked.\n\nInitially, Taank, 45, playfully responded by asking if that meant she had looked terrible in the previous season. However, she later acknowledged undergoing several beauty treatments, including Botox, fillers, and a dedicated skincare regimen. Additionally, she revealed that she had gotten veneers, which contributed to her noticeably different smile.\n\nHer co-stars, Erin Lichy and Sai De Silva, enthusiastically praised her transformation, reinforcing how common cosmetic enhancements are within the Real Housewives universe.\n\nInterestingly, Cohen himself has been candid about his views on plastic surgery. During a podcast interview in late 2024, he shared that he has never had Botox, despite being urged to do so by the late Joan Rivers.\n\n“Joan Rivers used to beg me to get Botox,” Cohen revealed. “But I always looked at people’s foreheads that don’t move, and I thought, ‘How about that? The gay guy’s the one who never got Botox!’”\n\nIn a world where beauty transformations are often scrutinized, Cohen’s direct questioning continues to stir debate. While some viewers find his approach unnecessary, others appreciate the transparency it brings to a reality TV franchise built on glamour, reinvention, and personal evolution. One thing is certain—whether fans love it or hate it, plastic surgery talk isn’t going away anytime soon on 'The Real Housewives.'\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds are seeking to dismiss co-star Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit. Baldoni's legal team claims this is an attempt to delay the discovery of facts. The dispute began with Lively's sexual harassment allegations, leading to Baldoni's lawsuits. The court dates have been moved up, and efforts for a gag order are ongoing.\n\nWith the date set for her court hearing in 2026, Blake Lively is trying to get one of the many lawsuits scrapped with her 'It Ends With Us' co-star Justin Baldoni.\n\nIn the latest update on the legal drama between the warring co-stars, it has been revealed that Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, are set to officially move to have Baldoni's $400 Million defamation lawsuit against them dismissed.\n\nIn a letter submitted on Thursday, attorney Michael Gottlieb, representing Lively and Reynolds, informed Judge Lewis Liman of their intent to seek dismissal of Baldoni’s suit. “The Lively-Reynolds Parties intend to move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint,” the letter stated, as reported by Deadline.\n\nBaldoni’s legal team, however, was quick to respond, saying “All these motions to dismiss are just yet another attempt by Ms. Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Leslie Sloan to hide and delay the discovery of the hundreds of pages of true facts and well-documented information that we remain dedicated to providing publicly, with full transparency,” Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, told Deadline.\n\nHe also reiterated his confidence that such motions would be denied.\n\nThe legal dispute began when Lively raised allegations of sexual harassment and claimed that director Baldoni along with others of the film's producers started a 'smear campaign' against her. This prompted Baldoni to clap back with a $250 million lawsuit against The New York Times. He then followed it up with a separate $400 million lawsuit against Lively, Reynolds, and their PR chief, Leslie Sloan, on January 16, citing defamation and extortion.\n\nSpeculation about tensions between the co-stars had been circulating for months, with the latest buzz indicating that Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds is the one to blame for the legal drama. Following Blake and Baldoni's 'flirty' text messages being leaked online, many have now suspected that a 'jealous' Reynolds could have spearheaded the lawsuits and allegations.\n\nWith the legal battle playing out both in court and in the media, Judge Liman recently moved up a pretrial conference from February 12 to February 3.\n\nMeanwhile, Lively and Reynolds' legal team has also been pushing for a 'gag order' against Baldoni’s attorney to curb what they describe as 'prejudicial statements' made outside of court which could influence the jury.\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Creators on Peter Parker’s MCU Connection! - Exclusive\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Los Angeles wildfires forced celebrities to evacuate, with Meryl Streep making a dramatic escape by cutting through a fence and driving through her neighbor's yard. Several celebrities like Mandy Moore and Paris Hilton lost their homes in the devastating fires.\n\nThe devastating wildfires in Los Angeles forced numerous celebrities to evacuate as flames tore through affluent neighborhoods like Malibu, Pacific Palisades, and Santa Monica. Among those caught in the chaos was Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep, whose escape was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nHer nephew, Abe Streep, revealed to New York Magazine Intelligencer that the Hollywood icon had to resort to drastic measures when she found herself trapped with no clear route to safety.\n\nWhen Streep received the emergency evacuation order, she quickly prepared to leave. However, disaster struck before she could drive away—an enormous tree had collapsed across her driveway, completely blocking her only exit. With time running out and the fire rapidly approaching, she had to think fast.\n\nDetermined to find a way out, Streep borrowed wire cutters from a neighbor and took matters into her own hands. According to Abe, she cut a massive hole—large enough to fit a car—through the fence that separated her property from the adjacent home. Without hesitation, she drove through her neighbor’s yard, making a daring escape just in time.\n\nHer quick thinking and resourcefulness ultimately saved her from the encroaching inferno, highlighting the importance of staying calm and making split-second decisions in life-threatening situations.\n\nWhile Streep managed to flee unharmed, the fires left a trail of devastation in their wake, destroying several celebrity homes. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the list of stars who lost their properties includes Mandy Moore, Anna Faris, Paris Hilton, Jeff Bridges, Billy Crystal, Cary Elwes, Bozoma Saint John, Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag, Diane Warren, Cameron Mathison, Ricki Lake and Jhené Aiko, among others.\n\nMany took to social media to share heartbreaking images of their burned-down homes, showcasing the sheer intensity of the wildfire’s destruction.\n\nStreep’s harrowing escape serves as a stark reminder of how unpredictable and dangerous wildfires can be. While California residents are no strangers to these disasters, the increasing severity of such fires continues to leave countless families displaced and homes reduced to ashes.\n\nAs firefighters battle to contain future blazes, stories like Streep’s highlight the urgency of emergency preparedness and the importance of staying vigilant in the face of natural disasters.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

The movie outperformed competitors but saw a slowdown in its second week, facing new releases.\n\ntwitter\n\nFrom Rani in ‘Queen’ to Jhansi Ki Rani in ‘Manikarnika,’ Kangana Ranaut has repeatedly taken characters that challenge an actor. This time she took the character of India’s former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, as she made it to the big screen with her latest film ‘Emergency’. She not only acted in the movie but donned the director’s hat. It is her first solo directorial, which chronicles the events of India’s emergency era - one of the most controversial times in the nation’s political landscape. The movie is close to completing its two-week run at the box office, and according to a Sacnilk report, on its second Thursday, the movie minted Rs. 0.17 crore (early estimates). With this, the film stands at a total net India collection of Rs. 17.47 crore.\n\nPoll\n\nDo You Prefer Watching Movies in Theaters or at Home?\n\nHome for Comfort and Convenience Theaters for the Big-Screen Experience\n\nEmergency Movie Review\n\nReleased on January 17, 2025, after a lot of delays, the movie had a decent opening of Rs.2 crore. In the following days, it saw a rise in the business and was even able to beat her competitors - ‘Azaad’ starring Ajay Devgn and introducing Rasha Thandani and Aman Devgan, and ‘Game Changer’ featuring Ram Charan and Kiara Advani. In the first week, the movie made more than Rs.14 crore, but in the second week, the business went slow. It did benefit from the Republic Day weekend, but a few days later has witnessed a slight dip.\n\nHere’s the day-wise India net collection of ‘Emergency’\n\nDay 1 [1st Friday] ₹ 2.5 Cr\n\nDay 2 [1st Saturday] ₹ 3.6 Cr\n\nDay 3 [1st Sunday] ₹ 4.25 Cr\n\nDay 4 [1st Monday] ₹ 1.05 Cr\n\nDay 5 [1st Tuesday] ₹ 1 Cr\n\nDay 6 [1st Wednesday] ₹ 1 Cr\n\nDay 7 [1st Thursday] ₹ 0.9 Cr\n\nWeek 1 Collection ₹ 14.3 Cr\n\nDay 8 [2nd Friday] ₹ 0.4 Cr\n\nDay 9 [2nd Saturday] ₹ 0.85 Cr\n\nDay 10 [2nd Sunday] ₹ 1.15 Cr\n\nDay 11 [2nd Monday] ₹ 0.2 Cr\n\nDay 12 [2nd Tuesday] ₹ 0.20 Cr\n\nDay 13 [2nd Wednesday] ₹ 0.20 Cr\n\nDay 14 [2nd Thursday] ₹ 0.17 Cr (early estimates)\n\nTotal ₹ 17.47Cr\n\nIt would be interesting to see the performance of the movie over the weekend, as today Shahid Kapoor’s ‘Deva’ is making it to the theatres. With this, there are multiple options for the audience to choose from, as last week, ‘Sky Force’ also entered the race.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

So you feel we should get married? What’s your key point for us to get married – shaadi or a film project?” The actor also revealed that she is willing to get married but is unable to find a groom. “Ladka nahin mil raha hai.

It’s a testimony to your work that you could convincingly script through good performances, through great chemistry, that you know this couple belong to each other.”\n\nAmeesha Patel and Salman Khan starred together in Yeh Hai Jalwa (2002).

She acknowledged that fans continue to support iconic films, highlighting how Gadar 1 and Gadar 2 had similar nostalgic success at the box office. She also expressed gratitude for the opportunity to revisit the big screen alongside Hrithik Roshan through their debut film.\n\nOn the work front, Salman will next be seen in the film 'Sikandar' which is slated for an Eid 2025 release.

Renee was dressed in a pink gown as she reunited with her ‘Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy’ co-stars Hugh Grant, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Leo Woodall. Further, Director Michael Morris and screenwriter Helen Fielding also graced the event.\n\nMeanwhile, Renée’s sweetheart Anstead didn’t mark his presence at the event.

    "raw_text": "The highly anticipated animated series 'Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man' premiered on January 29, drawing inspiration from comic books, previous Spider-Man adaptations, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Showrunners Jeff Trammell and Mel Zwyer in an exclusive interview with ETimes, explore Peter Parker's journey post 'Captain America: Civil War' while incorporating classic elements in a fresh and unique setting.\n\n' Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man ' is swinging into action with the highly anticipated animated series that is set to bring a fresh yet familiar take on everyone's favourite web-slinger.\n\nThe series which debuted on Wednesday, Jan 29, draws some clear parallels with the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, particularly with Tom Holland’s portrayal as Peter Parker. In an exclusive conversation with ETimes, showrunners Jeff Trammell and Mel Zwyer delved into the inspirations behind the series, its connection to past Spider-Man adaptations, and how it carves its own identity within the vast Spidey legacy.\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Creators on Peter Parker’s MCU Connection! - Exclusive\n\n'Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man' which is already shaping up to be one of the most faithful adaptations of the web-slinger yet, with a style that brings the classic comic book experience to life. When asked about their key influences, Mel acknowledged the importance of drawing from all facets of Spider-Man’s history. \"I would say just everything Spider-Man that came before us, right? Not just comics, but movies, cartoons, games, toys—everything Spider-Man we all embraced. When it comes to the comics, I would say Silver Age comics, the ‘60s and ‘70s—the origins of the look—that was kind of like our guiding point in terms of storytelling.\"\n\nJeff Trammell echoed this sentiment while pointing to more modern influences. \"Like Mel mentioned, everything that came before it, but especially for me, the ‘90s Spider-Man series and Spectacular Spider-Man from the 2010s—those are series that I love. So those are definitely things that I was borrowing from, as well as various films and comics.\"\n\nThe series takes off in a rather familiar, yet intriguing setting - post the events of 'Captain America: Civil War'. Considering that the film served as a launchpad for Spidey in the MCU, it's not hard to think why the team would use this narrative as its foundation. Trammell explained the decision behind this choice and how it aligns Peter Parker with Tom Holland’s version over other actors who played the role like Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. Jeff says, \"I think, picking up where we pick up, we’re kind of similar to Tom Holland’s portrayal when he joins the MCU. That’s the big event at the moment. So even just picking up there and deviating onto our own path while still showing that these are things happening in the world does a great job of tying us to the greater MCU. But we don’t need to have Captain America show up every other episode or something. It allows us to have our setting, our backdrop of a world, but still focus on the story we’re telling with our characters.\"\n\nBesides reimagining iconic characters, the show also gives a new spin to some famous dialogues. Expressing his excitement about bringing classic interactions to life in a fresh new setting, Trammell tells us, \"Oh man, I think being just a fan of those characters, it’s always exciting to write a scene with Norman and Peter having a conversation, or viewing how Harry and Peter interact together—those are always going to be such cool things to do. So I wanted to make sure that each one of those moments feels special and unique.\"\n\nIf you thought you saw every Spider-Man costume there was in 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse', let us tell you, you've not. This new series features the web-slinger in some rather vintage and comic-book-accurate suits. Sharing their thoughts about incorporating the same into their story, Jeff, says, \"In terms of the costumes, I really love the inspiration that we used for what becomes the Oscorp suit. Seeing that was really cool for me.\"\n\nMel Zwyer also shared his enthusiasm for costume design, particularly the black suit. \"Yeah, I really like the black suit. Unfortunately, it didn’t make an appearance, but I don’t know—maybe in the future, hopefully one day. Just a new take on the homemade suit was a fun part to explore, and then, of course, we ended up with the classic red and blue.\"\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man follows Peter Parker's journey as he navigates his dual life as a high school student and superhero. It features a talented voice cast, including Hudson Thames as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Colman Domingo as Norman Osborn, Eugene Byrd as Lonnie Lincoln, Grace Song as Nico Minoru, Zeno Robinson as Harry Osborn, and Kari Wahlgren as Aunt May.\n\nThe series which premiered on Disney+ Hotstar with the first two episodes releasing simultaneously will have its subsequent episodes scheduled for weekly releases every Wednesday. The finale of the 10-part series will air on February 19.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Selena Gomez voiced her concern over Donald Trump's immigration laws and their impact on undocumented immigrants, especially children. Despite facing backlash and deleting her emotional video, she received support from Flavor Flav for her bravery in expressing her views. Gomez's compassion remains steadfast.\n\nSelena Gomez recently made a statement regarding Donald Trumps’ immigration laws. After coming into power, Trump took over immigration in the country with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This reportedly resulted in the arrest of 956 people on Sunday (January 26) alone. This left Selena overwhelmed, holding back her tears the singer-actress shared a video, which she later deleted. After the video, Flavor Flav came to Selena Gomez‘s defence.\n\nThe video which currently has been deleted by Selena, had her saying, “I just wanted to say that I’m so sorry. All my people are getting attacked. The children, I don’t understand. I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something but I can’t. I don’t know what to do, I’ll try everything I promise”.\n\nThe reason why she took the video off, was the constant backlash she faced. She was heavily trolled for expressing herself, not holding her emotions, and expressing her opinion on the matter. Thus, in another story she wrote - “Apparently it’s not OK to show empathy for people”.\n\nAmid all the criticism, Flavor Flav hailed Selena for her comments. “Team Selena Gomez. Again. That woman is always so brave to share her truth,,, and so many are quick to bully her,” he wrote on X.\n\nSelena is one of the artists who never holds back her thoughts and opinions. Earlier, in 2019, when she hosted the show Living Undocumented, she was very vocal about her support of undocumented migrants in the US.\n\n“Undocumented immigration is an issue I think about every day, and I never forget how blessed I am to have been born in this country thanks to my family and the grace of circumstance,” she said at the time.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "title": "Legal experts dismiss Justin Baldoni’s $400M lawsuit against Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds as a “publicity stunt”",
    "authors": ["TOI Entertainment Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Justin Baldoni’s $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds is viewed skeptically by legal experts, who see it as a publicity stunt rather than a serious financial claim. Lively has also filed a counter-lawsuit alleging sexual harassment. The high-profile trial is set for March 2026, with both sides' arguments eagerly anticipated.\n\nJustin Baldoni’s staggering $400 million lawsuit against Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds has sparked widespread debate, with legal analysts suggesting the case is more about making headlines than securing a financial windfall. The lawsuit, which demands nearly four times the couple’s combined net worth, is being viewed with skepticism by industry experts.\n\nRaiford Dalton Palmer, a family law attorney unaffiliated with the case, believes the astronomical figure is arbitrary. Speaking to Page Six, he remarked, “That number seems completely random. There’s no legal basis for such an amount in this kind of case.” He explained that lawyers often file for inflated damages as a scare tactic or to draw media attention.\n\nNeama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, echoed similar doubts. “The exaggerated dollar amount is a strategy it fuels headlines and puts pressure on the defendants,” he explained. “This case is more about Baldoni reclaiming his reputation than actually collecting hundreds of millions from Lively and Reynolds.”\n\nBaldoni, who has faced professional fallout—including being dropped by WME and losing a women’s solidarity award is seemingly fighting to rebuild his image amid the controversy.\n\nEntertainment attorney Camron Dowlatshahi described the lawsuit as “a PR move more than a legitimate legal pursuit.” He stressed that the only way Baldoni could justify the demand is if he could prove he was on track to earning half a billion dollars before the alleged defamation and extortion claims derailed his career.\n\nFinancially, the lawsuit’s demands far exceed what Lively and Reynolds could realistically pay. According to Forbes, Lively’s net worth is estimated at $30 million, while Reynolds’ stands at approximately $71.5 million bringing their combined assets to about $101.5 million. That’s a fraction of the damages Baldoni is seeking.\n\nNicole Page, a partner at 'Reavis Page Jump LLP,' noted that exaggerated damage claims are common in defamation lawsuits. “Plaintiffs often cite astronomical figures, but proving those damages in court is an entirely different matter. These cases frequently involve subjective and speculative financial losses.”\n\nAs Baldoni’s lawsuit grabs headlines, Lively has launched her own legal action against him. Her lawsuit, filed after a complaint to the California Civil Rights Department in December 2024, alleges multiple offenses, including sexual harassment, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, and emotional distress. 'The Gossip Girl' actress claims Baldoni made inappropriate sexual remarks on set, commented on his struggles with porn addiction, intruded on her while she was breastfeeding, and engaged in body-shaming behavior. Justin and his representatives have only refuted the claims and are looking forward to leave no stone unturned in proving the director-actor's innocence. Meanwhile, the case and the claims are taking twists and turns with every new day and new update.\n\nWith the legal battle intensifying, fans and industry insiders are eager to see how the case unfolds. The high-profile trial is scheduled to begin on March 9, 2026, promising to keep Hollywood on edge as both sides present their arguments. While Baldoni’s lawsuit continues to dominate conversations, legal experts remain unconvinced that he will walk away with anything close to the $400 million he is demanding.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

Despite speculation and former co-star Anthony Mackie's surprise, Evans confirmed he will not be involved in the upcoming MCU film. Fans remain sceptical, recalling past surprise returns in the Marvel universe.\n\nWith the release of ' Captain America: Brave New World ' just around the corner, rumours have been running wild about former 'Captain America' star Chris Evans making his return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\n\nBuzz doing the rounds indicated that the actor, best known for playing the superhero for over a decade, has been asked to return for the upcoming film ' Avengers: Doomsday ', which will also star Robert Downey Jr in the lead as the villain, Doctor Doom. Amidst the widespread speculation, Evans has now denied the rumours and stated that he is \"happily retired\" from his role.\n\nThe speculation gained traction after Evans’ former co-star, Anthony Mackie, reacted with surprise when asked about his potential return. Speaking to Esquire in a new cover story, Mackie, who now leads the Captain America franchise, admitted he was unaware of any such plans.\n\n“I didn’t know!” Mackie said. “I talked to Chris a few weeks ago, and it wasn’t on the table then. At least, he didn’t tell me it was on the table, because I asked him. I was like, ‘You know, they said they’re bringing everyone back for the movie. Are you coming back?’ He goes, ‘Oh, you know, I’m happily retired.’”\n\nMackie added that he only learned about the rumour when his manager showed him the report. “That’s all I know. I haven’t seen a script,” he admitted.\n\nEvans also addressed the speculation in his interview with Esquire, firmly denying any involvement saying, “That’s not true.”\n\n“This always happens. I mean, it happens every couple of years—ever since Endgame. I’ve just stopped responding to it. Yeah, no—happily retired,\" he quipped.\n\nHowever, fans remain sceptical considering that Marvel actors have previously denied their involvement in projects, only to make surprise appearances—most notably Andrew Garfield, who insisted for months that he was not in 'Spider-Man: No Way Home', finally returned as Peter Parker.\n\nWhile Evans insists he won’t be donning the shield again, he did recently make a cameo as Johnny Storm/Human Torch in 'Deadpool And Wolverine', reprising his role from Fantastic Four (2005) and its 2007 sequel.\n\n'Avengers: Doomsday' is set to be directed by the Russo Brothers and is eyeing a 2026 release date.

    "raw_text": "Dipika Chikhlia, who became a household name as Sita in Ramayan, recently welcomed Farah Khan into her Kerala-style home for a cooking session. The visit was filled with fun conversations, touching memories, and a closer look at Dipika’s life beyond her iconic role. From her family’s anecdotes to her timeless charm, the session gave a glimpse into how Dipika has gracefully balanced fame and family over the years.\n\nFarah Khan couldn’t stop admiring Dipika’s beauty, saying, “You’re so beautiful. You still look the same! It’s been 35 years, but you’re exactly how you were in Ramayan. I was wondering how you’d look now, but you’ve maintained yourself so well.” Dipika thanked her warmly, and the duo shared a lighthearted moment over her timeless charm.\n\nFarah was left impressed by Dipika’s serene home, exclaiming, “This house is so beautiful. It doesn’t even feel like it’s in Mumbai!” Dipika explained that her home is inspired by Kerala architecture, with terracotta accents and earthy elements creating a warm, inviting atmosphere.\n\nDipika shared a sweet story about meeting her husband, Hemant. “Hemant’s sister was married to my cousin brother. I used to call her bhabhi. He would take my pictures, and one day, I told my mom it felt odd. But eventually, love happened,” she said. Farah quipped, “This feels like a Sooraj Barjatya film!”\n\nDipika revealed, “People often tell me their mothers and grandmothers are fans. I jokingly ask them, ‘Aren’t you my fan too?’” She added that her role as Sita continues to resonate with audiences across generations.\n\nJuhi, Dipika’s daughter, confessed, “Growing up, I didn’t watch Ramayan because seeing mom like that felt weird. But in 10th grade, I watched it during a Hindi lesson.” Dipika added that the family watched it together during the Covid rerun.\n\nFarah was awestruck by Dipika’s spacious kitchen. “It’s so big and airy! We have a cramped galley kitchen. This is so bright and open,” she exclaimed. Dipika shared her love for the kitchen’s natural light and functionality.\n\nRuhi revealed how her mother’s fame often leads to overwhelming fan interactions. “People come to touch her feet wherever we go,” she shared. Dipika added, “Sometimes my saree almost comes off when crowds fall at my feet.” Their stories highlighted the devotion fans still have for the iconic Ramayan actress.",

    "title": "yang lakes: The mysteries and secrets of Mount Kailash",
    "authors": ["TOI Lifestyle Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Mount Kailash, famous for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, has forever been a holy site not just for Hindus, but also for Buddhist, Jains, and people of other religions. It is the divine abode of the Gods and the supreme Gurus, and is unclimbed and untouched by most of humanity. For some people trying to scale the Kailash parvat is a sign of disrespect to the Gods, and for others just doing the Kailash Mansarovar yatra is like living a 1000 positive lives. Many people believe that Mount Kailash is not just a natural formation but an ancient energy center housing the divine.\n\nFor Indian pilgrims, visiting Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar has always been challenging as it falls in the Tibet region, and devotees needed special permit from the Chinese government to visit. According to a TOI report from 2024, \"The Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra has been suspended since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the Chinese side's non-renewal of arrangements\". But with recent talks between the diplomats of the two countries, Indian devotees are eyeing a chance to visit Mount Kailash again, after a wait of years. And as the chance seems renewed, and you’d like to know more about Kailash parvat, here we mention 7 unique mysteries and secrets of the mountain.\n\nIn the Mount Kailash region, there are two lakes, both unique and divine in nature. One is the famous Mansarovar, also known as the Lake of the Gods, and there is a ‘Rakshas Tal’ or the lake of Asuras. The Mansarovar lake is considered one of the holiest lakes in Hinduism and Buddhism, and is believed to have been created by the Gods themselves to bathe before performing rituals. Devotees and pilgrims who visit Mount Kailash also take a dip in this lake. And then there is the Rakshas Tal, in a crescent moon shape, and a saltwater lake. It is popularly said that Rakshas tal was created by Ravan, and unlike Mansarovar, its water is salty and lifeless.Some people also call Mansarovar and Rakshas tal as the Yin-Yang of nature.\n\nThe Kailash Parvat is huge and grand to say the least, but it is not as big and tall as Everest, K2, and other great peaks. And yet, no human has been able to climb Mount Everest in the last few decades. Why? Well, some believe it is forbidden to set foot on Lord Shiva’s home and thus even the greatest mountaineers try not to climb Kailash parvat out of respect. But some climbers who tried to scale the mountain are said to have experienced mysterious situations why they climbed for a certain time but found themselves in the base location all over again.\n\nMany spiritual traditions claim that Mount Kailash is the axis mundi! Which means it is the cosmic center of the world and has the power to influence the spiritual pursuits of people around the world. Some people also believe that Mount Kailash is the peak that connects heaven and earth, and the pyramid on top is actually a pillar that connects the two.\n\nOne of the most famous legends about the Mount Kailash is about a lone monk who scaled the peak, meditated there, and returned back unharmed and completely normal. It is said that a Buddhist saint named Milarepa is the only person to have ever climbed Mount Kailash and came back to tell people about his experiences on top. It is believed that when Milrepa reached the top of the mountain he quickly realised that the peak was not meant for human presence and came down after paying his respects.\n\nFor people of different religions, Mount Kailash is the abode of their supreme deities. And for Hindus, Kailash parvat is the abode of Lord Shiva. Many people believe that Lord Shiva resides in the Kailash Parvat with Maa Parvati and Lord Ganesha, and that his miracles over there are felt by people when performing the Kailash Mansarovar yatra.\n\nOne of the most bizarre mysteries about Mount Kailash is the alleged time distortion that some people claim of. It is said that trekkers who go to Mount Kailash experience that 12 hours over there feel like two weeks, and their hair and nails grow unusually fast during the pilgrimage. Many also claim that the days pass unusually fast or slow near the mountain.",

    "title": "​Why some children are so obedient: 6 secrets parents don't tell​",
    "authors": ["TOI Lifestyle Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Parenting is often portrayed as a challenging journey filled with tantrums, defiance, and struggles for control. However, there are certain children who can seem to effortlessly glide through this, being more obedient and cooperative in situations when others would put up resistance. It makes one wonder: why is it so that some are more obedient than others? What is the hidden secret behind the good behavior of some children? While all children are unique, there are several factors related to their psyche, the environment, and their parents that can contribute to a child's obedience. Here are a few secrets parents may not share with you about why some children are so obedient.\n\nA child’s temperament plays a significant role in how they respond to authority and rules. While many children can be described as lively, spirited, or independent, others may have a more easygoing and calm disposition. Children with these temperaments may be more willing to follow instructions because they find comfort in routine and structure. They might also be more sensitive to their parents' emotional states and eager to please, which can make them appear particularly obedient.\n\nFor example, compliant children usually thrive under authority because they generally feel safer with boundaries and routines. Children with stronger wills or more fiery temperaments, on the other hand, might not be as compliant because they may be too focused on independence.\n\nOne of the most important factors that influence obedience is the consistency of parental expectations. Children thrive when they know what is expected of them and when there is consistency in how those expectations are enforced. Parents who are clear about rules and enforce them consistently are more likely to raise children who are obedient. Vagueness and inconsistency of the rules or arbitrarily enforcing the rules make children bound to test their limits and revolt against authority.\n\n​​Never discuss THIS with kids when they return from school​​\n\n​5 ways to make your child your best friend\n\n​\n\nWhen parents are consistent, children learn what behaviors are acceptable and what consequences will follow if those expectations are not met. This provides a sense of structure and predictability, which helps children feel secure and more willing to comply with rules.\n\nChildren who obey more tend to have parents who are reliant more on positive reinforcement rather than punishment. Positive reinforcement rewards good behaviors over evil ones. When there is praise, attention, or rewards made over the correct following of the rules, it is possible that the act repeated again follows. Reinforcing the thought that obeying leads to a positive outcome is a way parents can encourage this behavior. The most typical way parents encourage their children's compliance is by verbal praise, small rewards, and other privileges. Punishment-based approaches may often encourage resentment or fear, giving rise to defiance instead of cooperation.\n\nChildren who display obedience are often those who have developed strong emotional regulation and self-control. While temperament can play a role in this, emotional regulation can also be taught and nurtured. Children who can manage their impulses and emotions are more likely to follow directions, especially in situations that require patience or delayed gratification.\n\nParents who guide children to be able to control their emotions often build a setting in which obedience comes very naturally. For example, educating children on how to relax if they get agitated, taking deep breaths, or learning to wait for a while before acting out is equipping the child with behavior control mechanisms that will then yield more compliance whenever they are told to comply with instructions.\n\nStrong emotional connections between parents and children are essential for fostering obedience. Children who feel securely attached to their caregivers are more likely to trust their guidance and want to please them. This bond provides a foundation for healthy communication, as children are more likely to listen to and respect the authority of parents they feel close to.\n\nIn households where emotional bonds are weak or where children feel neglected or unsupported, disobedience may be more common. Children may act out in an attempt to gain attention or may feel that their needs are not being met in other ways. On the contrary, when children feel loved and understood, they are more likely to internalize the rules set by their parents and respond to requests with cooperation.\n\nChildren are observers, and their behavior is likely to be mimicked from their parents and guardians. If the parents are obedient to the societal rules, expectations, and norms, the children will probably imitate the same. Parents who exhibit self-discipline, deliver promises, and treat others with respect are the most influential examples to their children.\n\nChildren learn much by watching how their parents act around authority figures, respect rules, and regulate their own feelings. The more often that parents show respectful behavior and problem-solving, the more likely it is that children will learn to do so themselves. In addition, children are likely to learn how to cope with difficulties and guidelines by watching their parents deal with these issues in a gentle and patient manner.\n\nRaising an obedient child involves consistency, patience, and leading by example. Set clear boundaries and explain rules with reasoning, not just authority. Encourage mutual respect by listening to their feelings and concerns. Use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior and acknowledge their efforts. Discipline should be fair and consistent, focusing on teaching rather than punishment. Build trust through open communication and a strong bond. Encourage responsibility by allowing age-appropriate choices and consequences. Teach empathy and respect for others, modeling these values in your actions. A loving, supportive environment helps nurture both obedience and a well-rounded, confident individual.",

Over time, we got closer and decided to get engaged.”He added, “Aarti is kind, traditional, and homely—qualities I always wanted in a partner. We got engaged in Nepal and later visited the Ayodhya temple for darshan. While we haven’t set a wedding date yet, we are excited about this new chapter in our lives.”\n\nAn FIR has been filed against YouTuber Elvish Yadav for allegedly threatening Saurabh Gupta, a witness in the Noida rave party case. Gupta claimed that Yadav and his supporters threatened him at his society on May 10, 2024. Gupta had previously reported the incident to the police, but no FIR was registered. His brother, Gaurav Gupta, had earlier filed a complaint against Yadav for supplying snake venom at the rave party.

The case was registered under section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC, and an investigation is underway.\n\nArchana Puran Singh, known for The Great Indian Kapil Show, shared in a vlog that she fractured her hand and injured her face while shooting a movie with Rajkummar Rao. After being hospitalized, she underwent surgery and recovered in a few days. Archana apologized to Rajkummar for the production delay and assured him that she would return to work soon to avoid further losses. Her son, Aryamann, was visibly emotional and broke down in tears after hearing about her injuries.\n\nRakhi Sawant, known for her bold personality, has revealed her desire to get married in Pakistan after receiving good marriage proposals during her recent visit.

    "title": "9 reasons relationships fall apart even with deep love, as per psychology",
    "authors": ["ETimes.in"],
    "raw_text": "Have you ever been in a long-term relationship where you loved your partner deeply, and you knew they loved you just as much? Yet, somehow, despite all that love, the relationship began to fade. You find yourself looking back, wondering what went wrong, and struggling to find closure.\n\nLove is indeed powerful, but it’s not always enough to sustain a relationship over the long haul. That initial spark and chemistry can slowly fade, conversations that once flowed effortlessly may feel like a chore, and small arguments can start over seemingly nothing. When you reflect, it might feel like there was no major issue, leaving you puzzled about why things fell apart.\n\nHere are some often-overlooked reasons relationships can weaken over time. While they may seem minor in the moment, they carry immense weight. Dive in to discover what might have gone unnoticed.\n\nRelationships often struggle because of poor communication. When partners stop sharing their feelings, needs, or concerns, misunderstandings happen. Over time, these unspoken emotions build up and create silent resentment. This lack of communication can make even small problems feel much bigger. Open and honest conversations are what keep people close; without them, emotional distance grows, making it harder to solve issues or feel truly understood by each other.\n\nRoutines can bring stability, but they can also make a relationship feel dull. The excitement and effort from the early days might fade, leaving both partners feeling like they’re just going through the motions. Spontaneous dates, sweet gestures, and surprises often get pushed aside by everyday responsibilities. If couples don’t make an effort to keep things fun and fresh, the relationship can start to feel more like a routine than a real connection, which can lead to unhappiness over time.\n\nBe it close friends, parents, or family members-- never let others make decisions about things in your relationship with your partner. This could lead to your partner feeling unheard and neglected, thus creating distance and miscommunication between you two. Instead, have direct and honest communication with your partner and prioritise them above all.\n\nLet's admit it, when you love someone and know that they love you too, you start taking them for granted. Add to it greater responsibilities in life over time, and one would not have enough time to spend quality time with their loved one. This could make one feel unloved, unheard, and unseen in the relationship-- despite there being love between the couple. Spending quality time together helps in bonding and keeping the relationship going strong.\n\nDisagreements are a normal part of any relationship, but how couples handle them makes all the difference. If conflicts are ignored or avoided, they don’t just go away—they linger and build up. This can create tension and make even small arguments feel like a big deal. Over time, unresolved issues can chip away at trust and closeness, putting up emotional walls that are hard to tear down. Without healthy ways to work through problems, couples can drift apart, even if they still care about each other.\n\nLove is indeed strong, but it’s not always enough to overcome big differences in what two people want from life. For example, one person might focus on building their career, while the other dreams of a family-centered life. If these differences aren’t talked about or resolved, they can cause frustration and tension. Over time, it might feel like both partners are moving in opposite directions, making it hard to imagine a future together, even if they care deeply for each other.\n\nIn long-term relationships, it’s easy to take your partner for granted and assume they’ll always be there. Over time, things like saying thank you, giving compliments, or showing kindness can fade, leaving one or both people feeling unappreciated. This can lead to feelings of neglect or emotional distance. Even the best relationships need care and effort to stay strong. Without regularly showing appreciation, it can start to feel one-sided or stuck.\n\nCommunication is the key for any relationship to thrive. However, it is not only about speaking what's in your heart honestly, but also actively listening to your partner. Not listening to your partner's needs or concerns, or dismissing them can make them feel unloved and unwanted-- which can significantly affect your relationship and can even lead to its breakdown in the long run.\n\nIn a marriage or committed relationship, the two people involved should be each other's priority. However, over time, people start taking each other for granted or get busy with other aspects of life-- which can affect their relationship. Instead of growing apart, people should focus on growin together as a couple for a long and happy relationship.",

She shared her experience and hospital photos on Instagram, infusing optimism and humor into her post. Despite the injuries, Shweta maintains a positive outlook and encourages others to stay resilient, quoting Shah Rukh Khan’s iconic dialogue for inspiration.\n\nActress Shweta Rohira has hit the headlines after she revealed in her social media post that she is now recovering from a terrifying accident.\n\nThe actress, who was previously married to actor Pulkit Samrat, shared in an Instagram post that she was hospitalised after meeting with an accident that left her with multiple fractures and injuries. In true Bollywood style, she infused her post with optimism, humour, and a generous dose of Shah Rukh Khan's iconic dialogues.\n\nSharing photos of herself from her hospital bed, Shweta detailed the unexpected turn of events that led to her injury. \"Life is full of surprises, isn’t it? One moment, you’re humming Kal Ho Naa Ho and planning to tackle your day. The next moment, life decides to say, ‘Hold my chai,’ and sends a bike your way,\" she wrote.\n\nRecalling the incident, she shared how she a casual stroll landed her straight into what she humorously called a \"forced rest mode.\" Reflecting on the incident, she said, \"For no fault of mine, I found myself going from walking to flying (not the Bollywood slow-mo kind, sadly) and landing straight into a forced rest mode. Fractured bones, bruises, and endless hours in bed—this wasn’t in my to-do list. But hey, maybe the universe thought I needed a lesson in patience or just wanted me to star in my own mini-soap opera, complete with hospital drama. The truth is, sometimes life shakes us to break us, only to rebuild us stronger. After all, destruction paves the way for construction.\"\n\nDespite the pain, she maintained an upbeat outlook, saying, \"while it hurts now, I know this is just a chapter, not the whole story.\"\n\nDetermined to stay positive, she added, \"So here I am—living with faith, holding on to hope, smiling through the pain (okay, trying to), and reminding myself that this too shall pass.\" Channelling her filmy side, she quoted Shah Rukh Khan's iconic dialogue and said, \"Life throws curveballs, but as they say in the movies, “Picture abhi baaki hai, mere dost.”\n\nReminding herself and her followers that setbacks are just temporary chapters in their lives, she cheered them on saying, \"To anyone going through tough times, remember: surrender to the moment, take it one day at a time, and trust the process. Pain is temporary, but resilience is forever.\"\n\nEnding on a lighthearted note, she quipped, \"I might look like Humpty Dumpty in this hospital bed, but I promise to come back stronger—and maybe with a new song to hum!\"\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

In an exclusive conversation with Times of India TV, she shared insights into her personal and professional life. When asked about baby planning, she playfully remarked, \"Everyone is after me,\" highlighting the constant curiosity from family and fans. She also spoke about her strong bond with her husband, Vicky Jain, emphasizing their competitive nature. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nWe have new Jodis this season and quite interesting ones. We are having lots of fun shooting for the show. I feel I’m back in the Bigg Boss house since we have so many celebs from our Bigg Boss season. Abhishek Kumar, Samarth Jurel, Mannara Chopra. We all four are having a great time and it’s nice. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nI want the audience to decide who between Vicky and me does all the work. We both have decided to be nice to each other and happily do the show. We have lots of fun together but the thing is we both are very competitive. We have fights only proving our points. But it is going very well. It is fun and Vicky and I have lots of entertainment and masti in our life. This translates onscreen and even on the sets. The fun angle we bring is enjoyed by fans. He keeps pulling my leg and I pull his leg. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nSab mere peeche pade hain baccha kar lo...Mujhe jab karna hoga tab main kar loongi. Jis din hoga uss din toh pata chal he jaayega. Kitna he chupa lungi main and why will I hide it. (Everyone keeps telling me to have a baby... I’ll do it when the time is right. The day it happens, people will know—how much can I even hide?) And why would I hide it?\n\nRight now, I’m just focusing on work and I’m very happy with the way my career is going. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nThe best thing is that I’m getting to do films and on the other hand, I’m part of a show like Laughter Chefs which is loved by all. The best part about this show is that I’m getting to spend time with Vicky. I’m also getting a chance to make new friends through this show. We are laughing and having a gala time on Laughter Chefs. I’m balancing my personal and professional life well. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nWhile doing the last season we made so many friends and they became my family. We all are still in touch and keep meeting each other. We all bonded so well. I’m missing everyone from the previous season. When I first stepped on the sets for season 2, I started missing all of them. Aly, Jannat, Nia, Reem, Arjun, Karan. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nIt is a blessing that after so many years there is a show which is enjoyed by the audience and by every age group. Nobody imagined that this show would do so well. Now, people are getting inspired by this show and are making new cookery shows. It’s interesting that we came up with this cooking and fun format and others are getting inspired. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nWe spent so much time on the sets cooking that I didn't wish to enter the kitchen again. I love food and I am a true desi at heart. So I love eating but cooking is not my forte. I am good at managing things and organising things. I can run my house by guiding everyone but I don't enjoy cooking. I am very particular with food and I'm very choosy when it comes to food.

The founders requested Rs 50 lakh for 1% equity. Peyush Bansal closed the deal, appreciating the product's potential and offering global market placement.\n\nShark Tank India Season 4 recently featured two entrepreneurs presenting their startup, which sells headphones and aims to build a business in experiencing sound. Sonic Lamb creators Jagath Biddappa and Navajith Karkera explained that their unique technology allows users to experience sound rather than just hear it. The technology allows one's body to feel the vibrations of the music, which is unique to this company. The founders requested Rs 50 lakh in exchange for one percent ownership of the company, which is valued at Rs 50 crore.\n\nThe 'sharks' were immediately thrilled with the product packaging, but Namita Thapar was the first to bring up the elephant in the room, asking the creators to compare their items to Aman Gupta's boAt products. While the founder stated that their differentiator is \"audio quality and experience\", the pricing difference was also mentioned. Sonic Lamb's owners stated that their product is priced at Rs 17,999, as opposed to a similar product from boAt, which costs for Rs 2,000-2,500.\n\nAs the founders discussed the economics of their business and revealed the two rounds of fundraising, as well as the grant they received when they launched it, Anupam Mittal stated that they were in a difficult financial situation. The founders also stated that they were attempting to establish two sides of the same firm. One was the headphones company, which was aimed directly at customers, and the other was the immersive sound business, which they intend to license to automobile makers.\n\nAman Gupta advised the creators to contact his company so that they could license the technology for their luxury headphones, but he declined to invest in the company. Anupam Mittal and Vineeta Singh each made proposals, but each wanted the founders to go a different path and had numerous conditions for the purchase to proceed. Peyush Bansal also extended an offer while praising their \"phenomenal\" product. Peyush offered them a package that included placing their items in worldwide stores, allowing the product to gain global awareness. He also expressed an interest in incorporating their technology into his upcoming line of smart eyeglasses. Peyush signed an agreement with them for Rs 50 lakh in exchange for 1% ownership and 1% advisory shares.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

Her financial disclosures reveal a substantial net worth, including significant investments in real estate, stocks, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nCredit: X/@TulsiGabbard\n\nTulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence, will face intense scrutiny during her Senate confirmation hearing today. Lawmakers will question Tulsi over her apologist stance on foreign dictators and her controversial 2017 visit with Syria’s now-deposed leader.\n\nGabbard’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee will be an important test for her nomination. Her nomination had raised concerns within the intelligence community. Nearly 100 former intelligence and national security officials—including ex-CIA agents and former deputy secretaries of state—had signed a letter urging senators to review her record in a closed-door session. If her nomination is confirmed, Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, will oversee all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nCredit: X/@TulsiGabbard\n\nTulsi Gabbard is supported by President Donald Trump, with Trump Jr also issuing warnings to Republican senators. In an X post, he wrote, “Any Republican Senator who votes against @TulsiGabbard deserves a primary. No more Deep State b******!!!!”\n\nBeyond her political life, Tulsi’s financial life has been a topic of much scrutiny too. Let us look at her net worth and how she has accumulated her wealth over the years.\n\nTulsi Gabbard's net worth\n\nAs a nominee of one of the most powerful positions in the Trump position, Tulsi, recently, disclosed a sizable amount of wealth in her recently released personal financial disclosure report. Overall, Gabbard reported a net worth ranging between $55 million and $127 million, which includes a mortgage of $250,001 to $500,000 on her personal residence.\n\nCredit: X/@TulsiGabbard\n\nAccording to the filing, the former representative owns three apartment complexes in Katy, Stafford, and Austin, worth $55 million to $125 million. According to the filing, Gabbard disclosed owning between $100,001 and $250,000 in stocks, including investments in Tesla and Rumble, along with shares in Apple and the artificial intelligence company Nvidia Corp.\n\nFurther, Gabbard stated that she owns $50,000 in a Bitcoin ETF trust and holds various cryptocurrencies valued at up to $95,000. Her crypto investments include between $1,001 and $15,000 in Solana, the blockchain platform supporting the new Trump meme coin.\n\nLast year, ABC News reports, Tulsi’s main source of income was media engagement and speaking fees as well as her book advance. She reportedly earned a total of $1.2 million.\n\nTulsi Gabbard is a former democrat from Hawaii and a self-proclaimed Hindu American. Born on April 12, 1982 in Leloaloa, American Samoa, to Mike Gabbard and Carol Porter Gabbard, she practices Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a tradition within Hinduism.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

Dharmendra started a production house, Vijeta Films, just to launch his son Sunny. The movie was directed by Rahul Rawail and also starred Shammi Kapoor in a supporting role. Did you know that Dharmendra had tried to negotiate Shammi's fees for the film, as he found it on the higher side. This was more than 40 years ago as 'Betaab' had released in 1983. At that point in time, Kapoor had quoted Rs 3 lakh to do the film.\n\nPoll\n\nWhat do you love most about Shammi Kapoor's movies?\n\nHis Iconic Style His Energetic Performances\n\nDirector Rahul Rawail had shared memories of 'Betaab' and revealed how Shammi increased his fees, during a chat with Jagran. Rawail said, \"I had already spoken to Shammi Kapoor about Betaab. At that time, he asked for Rs 3 lakh for the film and I told Bikramjeet about it. He thought this was too much and asked Dharmendra to negotiate a bit.”\n\nIt was quite awkward for Dharmendra to negotiate on the money with a veteran like Shammi. However, he still did it. In response to that, Kapoor increased the fees more as a penalty as he did not like to negotiate on his money. Rawail added, \"He first spoke to Shammi ji about the film and then brought up money. Shammi Kapoor instantly said Rs 5 lakh. Everyone was puzzled because they were wondering ‘how did Shammi ji go from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh?'”\n\nRawail also said, \"Shammi ji smiled and said that ‘think of this as your penalty’. And Dharam ji had to agree. In a way, this was a way of showing respect to Shammi ji. Actually, Shammi Kapoor did not like negotiating with producers but he knew how to get his way with them,”\n\n'Betaab' turned out to be a blockbuster when it released and made Sunny into a star.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

He also criticised Hindi cinema for promoting hyper-masculinity and degrading femininity, expressing concern over the approval such films receive and highlighting the role of cinema as a historical record.\n\nNaseeruddin Shah is known for her versatile roles which have been quite hard-hitting sometimes. The actor is one of the best that one has seen in Hindi cinema. While one may think that he must be liking all his performance, the truth is, Naseer recently confessed that he regrets doing some movies. The actor revealed that he has done some movies just for the sake of money and he regrets those today.\n\nThe actor spoke at the Kerala Literature Festival during a conversation with actor Parvathy, \"I have also done some movies which I did only for the money, that’s the simple truth. I don’t think that one needs to ashamed of working for money, I mean what do we all do? But those are jobs I regret. Fortunately, people don’t remember the bad work you did. As an actor, they only remember the good things you did.\"\n\nDuring the same chat, Naseer also criticised Hindi cinema for the implosion of insecure hyper masculinity . He said that he doesn't approve of movies which celebrate masculinity and run down the femininity. Naseer said, \"I don’t know if it’s a reflection of our society or if it is a reflection of the fantasies of our society. I think the films which feed into the secret fantasies of men, who in their heart of hearts, look down on women, these are being fed and it’s actually very scary to see how much approval such films get from the common viewer. It’s very terrifying and it does explain the horrendous things that happen to women in a lot of places in our county.” He further added that the success of such movies is 'sickening'.\n\nTalking further on the function of cinema and how it's a record keeper, the actr said, \"The really important function of cinema is to act as a record of its times. Those are the most valuable films because these films will be seen 100 years later and if 100 years later, people want to know what India of 2025 was like, and they find a Bollywood film, that would be a big tragedy.”\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Kunal Bahl, the co-founder of Snapdeal and a new addition to Shark Tank India Season 4, opened up about his journey on the show in an exclusive chat with Times of India TV. Reflecting on his experience, Kunal described being on the Shark Tank India panel as “surreal”. He revealed that he had been in touch with the makers for some time before officially joining the popular entrepreneurial show.\n\nIt's been a fantastic experience. I have seen many of the episodes from Season 1-3 as a viewer, so it's always a bit surreal to be there in the tank yourself as one of the sharks and experiencing everything firsthand, but for the most important part is how much of an impact this show is having on the spirit of entrepreneurship in our country and each one of us is playing our own small role in enabling that.\n\nI was in touch with the Shark Tank team from season one onwards but for whatever reason like scheduling reasons, other reasons it didn't work out and then finally this year it did work out because there is a big common interest here of promoting entrepreneurship, so I also have that and I'm doing that through.\n\nI feel that the amplification that the show creates, the discussion, which we used to have in our room, we can do it on national scale. They are will learn from our mistakes, or get inspired from our knowledge and that in itself is really moving the needle for entrepreneurship in our country.\n\nI have small kids at home and what would I want them to watch? My daughter loves to talk about startups and business ideas and all that she's 8-years-old and Shark Tank just offers entertainment because if it was not entertaining it would be like a documentary right. This is not a documentary, it is an entertaining show. People come so that they have a laugh, they have a little few tears, they have vigorous discussion amongst the family members and friends. They discuss the deals and I think that's what makes it fun.\n\nI am an introvert and a private person. I don’t socialize much or meet many people. After work, I spend time with my family and a few close friends. So this is as much as going out of the comfort zone as it can be for me. Mere hisaab se isse zyada main kuch kar nahi sakta apne comfort zone ke bahar. But what motivates me to do it is imagine how much it is helping founders in the country, all the effort that the sharks are putting into it. It's a tremendous amount of effort. It is 100 and 100 and 100 of hours away from your family, away from your friends, away from your work but it's a very, very worthy cause.\n\nWhen I look back, people will say ‘Oh congratulations’. Actually I don't remember any of the euphoric moments because by the time the moment of euphoria is supposed to come, you've moved on to the next problem. When I look back on my journey, I only remember the times I fell. But as they say, success is going from one failure to the next without any loss of enthusiasm. So I think that's what founders do, they just they fall, they pick themselves up, they keep moving forward.",

    "title": "Deva Movie Review and Release LIVE Updates: Shahid Kapoor starrer off to poor start at the box office",
    "authors": ["Times Of India"],
    "raw_text": "In a journey spanning over two decades, Bollywood star Shahid Kapoor has never shied away from experimenting with his looks to transform into the characters he has played-whether it's Tommy Singh in Udta Punjab, Haider Meer in Haider, or Dev Ambre in the upcoming film Deva.\n\nShahid strongly believes that nothing is too much to invest in a character especially for those who love what they do.\n\nAsked how much is too much to invest in a character, Shahid told IANS: \"Nothing is too much, you know, if you love what you do, then why is anything too much?\"\n\nThe 43-year-old star added: \"So I would say whatever it takes to get the job done, but of course we are professional actors, you know, you don't need to actually do something. I think that's something sometimes people think that an actor should prep like that.\"\n\n\"Some actors also think like that, but I don't at all prescribe to that kind of a mindset. I think it's a job and you should know professionally how to do it. But you should give everything that you have to make it the best that it can be.\"\n\nEver since his debut in 2003 with \"Ishq Vishk\", Shahid has given memorable characters with films such as \"Vivah\", \"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero\", \"Jab We Met\", \"Haider\", \"Udta Punjab\", \"Kabir Singh\" and \"Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya\".\n\nShahid, who effortlessly embraces different roles each with a spoonful of his signature swag, has upped his own ante with every performance on screen.\n\nTalking about how he does it, Shahid said: \"I think it's a journey that you have, which is very personal as an actor with yourself. And of course, there is a strong element of wanting to give the audience a great experience when they come into the theater.\"\n\n\"I think with time and post-COVID, all of us actors have recognized the fact that it's not that easy to get the audience in the theaters like how it used to be before COVID. They like to watch stuff at home and stuff. So we are aware of that. And we want to really give you an amazing experience because the love of cinema is always watching something on the big screen. So that would always be the charm of filmmaking for all of us.\n\nTalking about his upcoming film, he said that Deva is a film that he feels should definitely be watched on the big screen.\n\n\"It's a big screen experience. And not just the character, but the world of the film is something that should be experienced in the theater. And it's now out on the 31st of Jan. So yes, a lot of effort, a lot of work, a lot of heart has gone into Deva.\"\n\nShahid Kapoor has received acclaim for his role in the action thriller 'Deva', which has been labeled an \"absolute banger.\" However, some viewers have pointed out that its opening scene shares similarities with the Malayalam film 'Mumbai Police', also directed by Rosshan Andrrews. This resemblance has sparked discussions about the film's originality. Despite this, 'Deva' has managed to keep audiences engaged with its captivating story and powerful performances.\n\nAs 'Deva' captivates audiences with its engaging storyline and intense performances, many users on X (formerly Twitter) have declared the film a “must-watch.” Early reactions emphasize Shahid's compelling portrayal of a rebellious cop, with fans praising the film's thrilling action sequences and gripping narrative. Viewers are calling it one of Kapoor's finest performances.\n\nA user said, “MASTERPIECE ALERT! Shahid Kapoor delivers a career-defining performance as the fierce & unhinged cop, and Rosshan Andrrews crafts an absolute banger of an action thriller! The intensity, Deva a must-watch\".\n\n“Deva Fantastic movie love the action of Shahid Kapoor,” another added.\n\nA film lover wrote, “Undisputed Winner. Crackling Performance and Hard hitting Climax. Shahid Kapoor nailed it\".\n\nAnother person wrote, “Deva Shahid Kapoor's artistry carries a depth that resonates with the soul. Every role he takes on unveils a new dimension of life, as if he’s presenting a philosophy through cinema. Wishing him all the best for his upcoming film!”.\n\n'Deva' is the first Hindi film directed by well-known Malayalam director Rosshan Andrrews. Produced by Zee Studios and Siddharth Roy Kapur, the movie tells the story of a brilliant but rebellious police officer named Dev Ambre, played by Shahid. As he investigates a high-profile case, he discovers layers of deceit and betrayal. This is Kapoor's first time playing a uniformed cop, bringing new energy to the role. The film also stars Pooja Hegde, along with Pavail Gulati, Pravessh Rana, Kubbra Sait, Girish Kulkarni, and Aditi Sandhya Sharma in supporting roles.\n\nEarlier this month, Pooja said that the fact that she has been loved, accepted and appreciated in all the industries that she has worked in is a privilege and an honour.\n\nWhen asked what she thought about being called the ‘Queen of Crossovers’, Pooja said, \"I just felt that I was at that point in my career where the roles I do now will define me who I am as an actor. I just want to take versatile roles. There is this other film of mine in which I play a very different character as compared to this.”\n\nShe had added, “I am working in many languages. I've always believed in going wherever the content is good. I've gone by my gut feeling. My journey has always been like… It’s not just been that one pan Indian film.”\n\n“I have worked in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi, and I have been loved, appreciated, and accepted, which is a privilege I feel. It's an honour. It's truly humbling and it makes me work harder.”\n\nPooja will also be seen starring opposite Suriya in director Karthik Subbaraj’s much-awaited Tamil film ‘Retro’, which has now been scheduled to hit screens on May 1 this year.\n\nPooja Hegde, whose latest release is the action thriller “Deva”, has spoken about what makes cop films universally loved so much. The actress also shared that she has always been fascinated by people in uniform.\n\nAsked why cop films with a spoonful of action and thrill is loved universally across all age groups, Pooja told IANS: “I think a good film is a good film and you can't keep a good film down. Maybe it's the flavor of the season, I don't know. Like maybe it's the mysteriousness of what they do and, you know, we're fascinated by them.”\n\nShe then mentioned how she has always been intrigued by people in uniform.\n\n“I've always been fascinated by people in uniform, you know, there's just something about it that is so intriguing and it's, it's always like you see someone in uniform and you always just want to emulate them or you, there is this mystery. So maybe that's why.”\n\nWith the perfect blend of acting talent and beauty, Pooja Hegde has worked with some of the finest filmmakers and biggest stars. However, the sought-after actress feels that while she has come a long way, she still has a long way to go.\n\nPooja started her acting journey in 2012 with the Tamil film Mugamoodi directed by Mysskin. She made her Bollywood debut opposite Hrithik Roshan in the 2016 film “Mohenjo Daro”.\n\nEver since then she has worked with big names such as Allu Arjun, Mahesh Babu, Prabhas, Hrithik Roshan, Salman Khan, Ram Charan and Ranveer Singh. She will next be seen in “Deva” starring Shahid Kapoor.\n\nAsked with a filmography filled with great directors and co-stars, does she feel she has made it?\n\nPooja told IANS: “I mean, I've made it far, quite far, but a long way to go in my mind. I don't think I want to put that pressure in my mind of making it or not. But yes, I have been here and still standing going strong.”\n\nPooja Hegde, who is one of the few actors to have made a name for herself in both South Indian and Hindi films, recently opened up about the challenges of managing her busy schedule and travelling between cities while working in both film industries.\n\nWhen asked if she finds it difficult to work in both industries at the same time, Pooja admitted that \"managing travel\" and balancing everything together could be \"challenging.\"\n\n\"Some days it is, I mean, the traveling part. I have to travel, so I always like jumping between two things. But also, for example, when I was shooting for Deva, I was also shooting for my film Retro, and they both are really different characters. So being able to snap out of one and go back into the other, balancing everything together, is challenging,\" Pooja told ANI.\n\nThe 'Retro' actress also shared that she chooses her projects based on the quality of the work rather than the language of the film.\n\n\"I have always gone with what the work is, and where I feel my role is good or if the film is good. I think that is more important to me than the language. I think if the work is good, it will reach people,\" she added.\n\nBollywood actor Shahid Kapoor hinted on Tuesday at a connection between his upcoming film \"Deva\" and the classic 1975 movie 'Deewaar,' noting the significance of Amitabh Bachchan's legendary character, Vijay, in his new project.\n\nIn 'Deva,' Kapoor portrays a brilliant yet rebellious police officer. The action thriller is directed by Rosshan Andrrews and also features Pooja Hegde and Pavail Gulati.\n\nEarlier this year, the movie's teaser poster was released, showcasing Shahid smoking a cigarette in front of a mural depicting Bachchan as Vijay, the spirited dockworker with a beedi hanging from his lips.\n\nWhen asked about the connection between 'Deva' and 'Deewaar', Shahid told PTI: \"This question should be for Rosshan because he was the one who chose that. There is a relevance within the film.\"\n\n'Deewaar,' which celebrated its 50th anniversary on January 21, is regarded as one of the greatest Hindi films ever made. Directed by Yash Chopra and written by the duo Salim-Javed, this action drama from 1975 tells the story of two brothers, Vijay and Ravi, who grew up in the slums of Mumbai. As they age, Vijay chooses a life of crime, while Ravi opts to become a principled police officer.\n\nBollywood actor Shahid Kapoor is once again facing scrutiny from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) regarding his upcoming film.\n\nAhead of the release of 'Deva' on Friday, January 31, it has been reported that a steamy scene had to be edited to secure a U/A certificate. The action-drama features Shahid in the lead role alongside Pooja Hegde, and the film underwent three significant modifications according to CBFC recommendations.\n\nDirector Rosshan Andrrews was asked to alter a lip-lock sequence, resulting in a reduction of six seconds from the kiss. Additional changes involved replacing \"foul gestures\" and several profanities with milder alternatives in both the dialogue and subtitles. Furthermore, the CBFC sought clarification from the filmmakers regarding references to Hutatma Chowk, a notable location in Mumbai's Fort area.\n\nThe final runtime of the film is now 2 hours, 36 minutes, and 59 seconds.\n\nThis isn't the first time Shahid Kapoor has encountered cuts from the CBFC. His 2024 romantic drama, 'Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya', which features Kriti Sanon, also had a lovemaking scene shortened by nine seconds—down from an original length of 36 seconds to meet CBFC standards ahead of its Valentine's Week release.\n\nDirected by Andrrews, 'Deva' marks Kapoor's return to the action genre, portraying a daring cop who walks the line between justice and rebellion. Pooja Hegde is set to play a journalist and the love interest of Shahid's character in the film.\n\nActress Pooja Hegde, who is considered a top actress in different film industries, says that the fact that she has been loved, accepted and appreciated in all the industries that she has worked in is a privilege and an honour.\n\nPooja, who is now gearing up for the release of her much-anticipated Hindi film 'Deva', recently participated in the trailer launch event of the film.\n\nWhen asked what she thought about being called the ‘Queen of Crossovers’, Pooja said, \"I just felt that I was at that point in my career where the roles I do now will define me who I am as an actor. I just want to take versatile roles. There is this other film of mine in which I play a very different character as compared to this.”\n\nThe actress further added, “I am working in many languages. I've always believed in going wherever the content is good. I've gone by my gut feeling. My journey has always been like… It’s not just been that one pan Indian film. I have worked in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi, and I have been loved, appreciated, and accepted, which is a privilege I feel. It's an honour. It's truly humbling and it makes me work harder. I am a Mumbai girl who started my career in Tamil Nadu, got love and appreciation in Telugu but I'm from Karnataka originally, so maybe that helps too!\"\n\nActor Shahid Kapoor said that for a long time many people have been urging him to take on a \"massy film\", and his upcoming project \"Deva\" marks that next step in his acting journey. In the action thriller, Kapoor is essaying the role of a brilliant but defiant police officer. It is directed by Rosshan Andrrews and also stars Pooja Hegde and Pavail Gulati.\n\nProduced by Siddharth Roy Kapur's Roy Kapur Films in collaboration with Zee Studios, the movie will hit the screens on January 31.\n\nKapoor unveiled the teaser of the film with fans at the Carter Road Amphitheatre and said, \"'Deva' is a piece of my heart. For many years, people were telling me to do a massy film. That you go out there and do it for the masses. So for me, this is that next step in my journey. It's been probably my most challenging film. There is so much in the character which I don't want to reveal. You watch it on January 31.\"",

    "raw_text": "BTS's Jungkook declined Usher's offer to perform at the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show due to his packed military service schedule. Usher performed a medley of his hit songs, while HYBE faced criticism for their handling of Jungkook's enlistment. Fans believe Jungkook's performance would have enhanced BTS's global music status.\n\nImage via Getty Images\n\nThe news of a remix of Standing Next to You with Usher by BTS's Jungkook excited fans who were hoping to see the two icons perform together at the Super Bowl halftime show. However, Jungkook had to decline the offer because he had to serve in the military. Still, Usher did an electrifying medley of 11 songs during the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show, showing his musical legacy.\n\nWhy did Jungkook turn down the 2024 Super Bowl performance?\n\nUsher offered BTS' Jungkook to perform at the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show, but the 27-year-old BTS star turned it down. According to Billboard, Usher tapped Jungkook to perform the Standing Next to You remix , but unfortunately, the latter had to turn it down due to his packed schedule at the South Korean military services.\n\nUsher performed a medley of his hit songs during the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show. On the other hand, the South Korean singer-songwriter was enlisted in the military in December 2023 and is expected to reunite with his bandmates in 2025. HYBE, the management company of BTS, responded to fans' complaints about Jungkook's absence from the Super Bowl halftime concert.\n\nRuling the headlines were rumors on 7th October 2024, stating Jungkook wouldn't be able to perform with Usher during the 2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show, due to military service beginning December 2023. ARMY was heartbroken-the global fandom that had its heart set to have Jungkook become the first K-popper to set foot on this legendary stage.\n\nHYBE's reaction to the circumstance was strikingly succinct, \"We have nothing to say.\" Fans feel that the agency mishandled Jungkook's enlistment schedule, and their disappointment has only grown as a result of this lack of acknowledgement.\n\nRegarding the situation, cultural analyst Kim Heon Sik made a statement saying, \"HYBE disregarded the significance of this stage, which led to the cancellation of Jungkook's Super Bowl halftime performance. I sincerely apologise for the way the artist was managed.”\n\nAlso Read: Novartis is bringing breast cancer awareness to Super Bowl LIX with the help of Hailee Steinfeld and Wanda Sykes\n\nThe Golden Maknae, Jungkook, achieved significant success with his solo album GOLDEN, which reached significant Billboard charts. He also made history by becoming the first K-pop performer to perform at the FIFA World Cup opening ceremony with his rendition of Dreamers. Fans believe his performance at the Super Bowl would have solidified BTS's music status.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "title": "Trump orders crackdown on campus antisemitism: Funding threats intensify debate over free speech and federal overreach",
    "authors": ["TOI Education"],
    "raw_text": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump has signed two executive orders aimed at reshaping American education policies. One directive focuses on school curricula related to race and sexuality, while the other, titled Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism, mandates strict enforcement against antisemitic incidents on college campuses. The order threatens federal funding cuts for non-compliant institutions, reinforcing accountability in higher education.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\n\nIn a sweeping move that underscores his second-term agenda, US President Donald Trump has signed two executive orders aimed at reshaping the landscape of American education. The directives address curricula on race and sexuality in schools and seek to combat antisemitism on college campuses, signaling a renewed federal push to regulate educational content and campus policies. The second one, titled Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism mandates stricter measures against antisemitic incidents in higher education, holding institutions accountable for protecting Jewish students. It instructs federal agencies to utilize all appropriate legal tools to prosecute and hold accountable perpetrators of unlawful antisemitic harassment and violence. The order also directs the Department of Education to ensure that institutions receiving federal funding enforce policies protecting Jewish students from discrimination and harassment. Non-compliance could result in the withdrawal of federal funds, thereby holding educational institutions accountable for safeguarding their students.\n\nCombatting antisemitism in college campuses\n\nOne of the most significant elements of Trump's executive actions is the focused effort to tackle antisemitism in US colleges and universities. The rising tide of antisemitic incidents on campuses across the country has prompted the president to take a firm stand. Under the terms of the executive order, educational institutions that fail to act decisively in addressing antisemitism could face severe penalties, including the revocation of federal funding and accreditation. In extreme cases, international students affiliated with terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, could lose their visas.\n\nThis policy marks a departure from previous administrations, with Trump’s administration taking a more aggressive approach toward ensuring that universities uphold a zero-tolerance stance on hate speech. The threat of financial penalties has added pressure on schools to comply, and many colleges that were under investigation for antisemitism were quick to reach settlements with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights before the administration’s end.\n\nEducational institutions under scrutiny: A rush to settle\n\nPrior to Trump's formal inauguration, several colleges were already facing investigations into antisemitic incidents. Fearing the repercussions of an incoming administration that made its position on antisemitism abundantly clear, many universities, inclu ding prominent institutions like the University of California and Rutgers University, sought to settle their cases. These settlements typically involved agreeing to policy changes, training programs, and reviews of past complaints.\n\nThe urgency of these settlements reflects the looming threat of losing federal funding and accreditation. As Kenneth Marcus, former head of the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, noted, university leaders were “desperate” to finalize agreements to avoid the potentially devastating consequences of non-compliance as reported by Associated Press, an American news agency. Trump’s warnings to Jewish donors in September about the severe penalties for colleges failing to address antisemitism emphasized the administration's firm stance on the issue.\n\nLegal and political debate: A clash of constitutional concerns\n\nThe two executive orders, while aligning with Trump’s campaign promises, have stirred considerable legal and political debate. Critics argue that the directives overstep federal authority by attempting to dictate the content taught in schools, a move that could be seen as an infringement on free speech and academic freedom. There is also concern about the orders' compatibility with constitutional protections, particularly regarding the First Amendment.\n\nThe controversy surrounding these executive orders raises important questions about the federal government’s role in influencing educational content. While Trump’s supporters view these actions as necessary to protect American values in education, detractors believe they could have unintended consequences for the balance of free expression and academic independence in the nation’s schools.\n\nStay updated with the latest education news on Times of India.

On Wednesday the tower supervisor directed that they be combined earlier.\n\n“The position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,” the report said. A person familiar with the matter, however, said the tower staffing that night was at a normal level.\n\nA top Army aviation official said the crew of the helicopter, a Black Hawk, was “very experienced” and familiar with the congested flying that occurs daily around the city.\n\n“Both pilots had flown this specific route before, at night. This wasn’t something new to either one of them,” said Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for army aviation.\n\nA midair collision between an Army helicopter and a jetliner killed all 67 people on board, officials said Thursday, after examining the military pilot's actions in what is now the country’s worst aviation disaster in nearly 25 years.\n\nAt least 28 bodies were recovered from the icy Potomac River after the helicopter apparently crossed into the path of an American Airlines regional jet late Wednesday. The plane was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport, just across the river from Washington, officials said. The aircraft carried 60 passengers and four crew members, while three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.\n\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed at a White House news conference that there were no survivors.\n\n“We are now at the point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation,” said John Donnelly, the fire chief in the nation’s capital.\n\nThe crash happened just before 9 pm in one of the most tightly monitored airspaces in the world, about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) south of the White House and the Capitol.\n\nInvestigators from the national transportation safety board (NTSB) have begun their inquiry, but officials said it could take months to determine the cause.\n\nSpokesperson Peter Knudson confirmed that the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the Bombardier CRJ700 jet have been retrieved and sent to NTSB labs for analysis.\n\nUS NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) Member Todd Inman says, \"Our investigative team will be on scene as long as it takes to obtain all of the perishable evidence and all the fact-finding needed to conclude of probable cause. Our mission is to understand not just what happened, but why it happened and to recommend changes to prevent it from happening again... We intend to have a preliminary report within 30 days and the final report will be issued once we've completed all of our fact-finding and investigation... Today, we are going to have an organizational meeting establishing our parties to our investigation... The NTSB offers this party status to those companies, government agencies and associations that have employees, activities or equipment involved in the accident...\"\n\n\"Once they join this investigation, they are not permitted to release documents or talk publicly about the investigation without the consent of the NTSB... Only the NTSB will provide information related to this investigation with one exception regarding the fatalities. That notification will be handled by the D.C. medical examiner. We will not discuss fatalities or names... We will analyze the facts, determine the probable cause of the accident and then issue a report... Later, today we will brief the families...\" he added.\n\nA crash between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter has killed teen figure skaters returning from a national meet with their mothers and coaches, as well as a group of union steamfitters from the Washington, D.C. area.\n\nThey were among 60 travelers and four crew members on board the flight late Wednesday when it collided with a Blackhawk helicopter that was carrying three soldiers. It appears all on board both aircraft were killed when the plane and helicopter collided over the Potomac River, officials say.\n\nJohn Donnelly, the fire chief in the nation’s capital, said he's confident that the remains of those killed in the crash will be recovered, but it may take some time.\n\nSeveral athletes on the flight had attended a development camp after in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships that ended Sunday in Wichita, Kansas, the organization said in a statement.\n\n“We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims’ families closely in our hearts,” U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement.\n\nAmerican Airlines set up a hotline as well as centers in Washington and Wichita for people searching for information about family members who may have been aboard Wednesday's downed flight. The hotline can be reached at 1-800 679 8215.\n\nAddressing the White House after the plane crash incident, US newly elected President Donald Trump said, \"I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation. Just before 9 pm last night, an American Airlines regional jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter carrying three military service members over the Potomac River in Washington, DC, while on final approach to Reagan National Airport. Both aircraft crashed instantly and were immediately submerged into the icy waters of the Potomac. Real tragedy.\"\n\n\" The massive search and rescue mission was underway throughout the night, leveraging every asset at our disposal. And I have to say, the local, state, federal, military, including the United States Coast Guard in particular, they've done a phenomenal job. So quick, so fast, it was mobilized immediately. The work has now shifted to a recovery mission. Sadly, there are no survivors. This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history, and a tragedy of terrible proportions. As one nation, we grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly...This has shaken a lot of people, including people, very sadly, from other nations who were on the flight...\" he added.\n\nThe close-knit world of figure skating was in mourning on Thursday after a passenger jet carrying athletes and coaches, including former Russian world pairs champions Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, crashed into Washington's Potomac River.\n\nThe plane carrying 64 collided midair with a military helicopter as it was approaching Reagan National Airport in Washington DC on Wednesday evening, plunging into the freezing river.\n\nSeveral members of the US figure skating community were also passengers, the sport's national governing body confirmed.\n\nThey had been taking part in a training camp for top juniors that was held after the US championships, which took place in Wichita, Kansas, at the weekend.\n\n\"U.S. Figure Skating can confirm that several members of our skating community were sadly aboard,\" the national governing body said in a statement.\n\n\"We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts.\"\n\nAuthorities in the US have not confirmed the identities of any of the victims but Russia's state TASS and RIA news agencies cited anonymous sources as saying that Shishkova and Naumov were on board, as well as Inna Volyanskaya, a former pair skater who competed for the Soviet Union.\n\n\"The International Skating Union (ISU) and the global skating community are deeply shocked by the tragic accident,\" the sport's world governing body said in a statement.\n\n\"We are heartbroken to learn that figure skaters, along with their families, friends, and coaches, are understood to be among those on board.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy.\n\n\"Figure skating is more than a sport. It's a close-knit family and we stand together. We remain in close contact with U.S. Figure Skating and offer our full support during this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nShishkova, 52, and Naumov, 55, competed at six world championships between 1991 to 1996, winning gold, silver and bronze medals.\n\nThe peak of their career was winning the 1994 pairs title at the world championships in Chiba, Japan.\n\nThey dethroned the Canadian title holders Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler, who had deprived them of bronze at the 1994 Olympics a few weeks earlier.\n\nBorn in Saint Petersburg, the couple, who married in 1995, were known for their highly classicical skating style.\n\nThey ended their careers after failing to qualify for the Nagano Olympic Games in 1998.\n\nAfter becoming professionals, they moved to the United States to become coaches, first in Connecticut then in Boston since 2017.\n\nTheir 23-year-old son Maxim Naumov, the US junior champion in 2020, had recently placed fourth in the US national championships in Kansas. It is not known whether he was onboard.\n\nIn 1961, 18 members of the US figure skating team died in a plane crash while traveling to Prague for the World Championships.\n\nA man whose wife was on the American Eagle flight that crashed into the Potomac River on Wednesday night said he became alarmed when his text messages to her stopped going through, CBS News reported.\n\nHamaad Raza told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV that he had been texting with his wife as she was preparing to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The last message he received from her read, \"We're landing in 20.\" However, when he tried to reply, none of his messages were delivered.\n\n\"That's when I realized something might be up,\" Raza said.\n\nHis wife, 26, had been traveling to Wichita for work and had always been fearful of flying, he added. The couple has been married for just over two years.\n\n\"I'm just praying that somebody's pulling her out of the river as we speak,\" Raza said. \"That's all I can pray for.\"\n\nAuthorities have yet to release an official casualty count, but multiple bodies have been recovered from the river as search and rescue operations continue.\n\nA mid-air collision over Washington on Wednesday night resulted in a US commercial airliner with 64 people on board and a military Black Hawk helicopter crashing into the Potomac River, triggering a massive rescue operation. The Bombardier jet, operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA, was approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport when it struck the military helicopter conducting a training flight. Footage captured the moment of impact, showing a fireball illuminating the night sky before both aircraft plunged into the near-freezing waters. Authorities confirmed the crash but have yet to provide an official casualty count. However, multiple bodies have been recovered, with reports suggesting at least 18 fatalities.\n\nRescue efforts remain \"extremely complex,\" with over 300 personnel deployed in harsh conditions, including strong winds, ice, and murky waters. Divers, inflatable boats, and helicopters equipped with powerful searchlights are scouring the area, with the Coast Guard providing additional support. Several members of the US figure skating community were reportedly on board the doomed flight, including Russia’s 1994 world champion pair Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov. Officials anticipate that search operations will continue for several days as teams work to recover victims and debris.\n\nThe incident has raised serious concerns over aviation safety, with former President Donald Trump calling the collision preventable. He questioned why the helicopter did not take evasive action, given the clear night and visible approach of the plane. Trump also criticised air traffic control, suggesting they failed to properly direct the helicopter away from the jet’s path. Investigators will now focus on what led to the mid-air crash and whether proper protocols were followed to avert the disaster.\n\nUS President Donald Trump responded to the mid-air collision between a passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday night, calling the incident \"NOT GOOD\" and questioning helicopter's flight path on a \"CLEAR NIGHT.\"\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump questioned why the helicopter didn’t avoid the plane, writing, \"The airplane was on a perfect and routine line of approach to the airport. The helicopter was going straight at the airplane for an extended period of time. It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why didn’t the helicopter go up or down, or turn. Why didn’t the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane? This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!\"",

Sangwan, who hails from Delhi and trained under Glenn McGrath, made a significant impact by dismissing Kohli and has shown promising growth in his cricket career.\n\nNEW DELHI: Virat Kohli's much-hyped return to Delhi squad turned out to be a damp squib as the former India captain was clean bowled for just 6 runs on the second day of the Ranji Trophy clash against Railways.\n\nKohli, whose comeback had put Delhi into a frenzy, walked out to bat to loud cheers after the dismissal of Yash Dhull.\n\nThe Railways bowlers tested the modern day great with some fine incoming deliveries that Kohli managed to play.\n\nVirat got off the mark with a single to the covers as the Delhi crowd cheered on.\n\nAs Himanshu Sangwan came in the attack, Virat stepped out of the crease and hit a delivery straight down the ground for his first boundary and the Delhi crowd went berserk.\n\nHowever, Himanshu Sangwan had his revenge on the very next delivery as Kohli again stepped out of his crease, but the ball came back in viciously after pitching and sneaked through the bat-pad gap to send the off-stump cart-wheeling all the way to the slips.\n\nThe Delhi crowd was stunned into silence as a disappointed Kohli walked back towards the pavilion - his stay at the crease lasting 15 balls accounting for 6 runs.\n\nWho is Himanshu Sangwan\n\nBorn in Najafgarh, the right-arm medium-fast bowler also hails from Delhi and made his List A debut in 2019 in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , followed by his Twenty20 debut in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and first-class debut in the Ranji Trophy in the same year.\n\nSangwan worked as a ticket collector at the New Delhi Railway Station before his cricketing career took off.\n\nSangwan's time at the MRF Pace Foundation, where he trained under Australian fast-bowling great Glenn McGrath, marked a pivotal moment in his career. Sangwan's growth as a bowler was greatly aided by McGrath's advice, who placed a strong emphasis on patience and keeping to the fundamentals.\n\nSangwan put up a standout effort at the Wankhede Stadium in a Ranji Trophy match versus Mumbai. In the game, he claimed six wickets, including the valuable scalps of Prithvi Shaw and Ajinkya Rahane, helping Railways defeat the 41-time Ranji winners by ten wickets.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

Wayans Jr. and his father reminisced about the NBA star’s visits and the excitement it brought, despite Jordan’s overwhelming celebrity status.\n\nMichael Jordan and Damon Wayans J. Image via: Aurelien Meunier, Getty Images\n\nNBA legend Michael Jordan is arguably the greatest athlete in the history of the league alongside his close competitor LeBron James. Certainly, Jordan has kept most of the details of his private life hidden from the public but actor and comedian Damon Wayans Jr. has recently made a big revelation about the NBA Hall of Famer. Wayans Jr. shared that Jordan used to visit his house for snacks.\n\nMichael Jordan frequently visited Damon Wayans Jr’s house for snacks\n\nMichael Jordan. Image via: Aurelien Meunier/ Getty Images\n\nThere are some things that $3 billion rich (per Forbes) Michael Jordan can’t buy and one of those things is the snacks found in Damon Wayans Jr’s house. While speaking of his dream-come-true childhood, Wayans Jr proudly shared the moments he spent with the NBA legend. In a recent interview, he shared astonishing details of Jordan’s influence in his life. \"We were so incredibly privileged,” he said of his childhood. For context, Wayans Jr’s father Damon Wayans is also a successful comedian and actor with several movies and television shows to his credit.\n\n“We always had activities, and always had friends over. Snacks! So many snacks, it was great. The snack game was off the chain. Michael Jordan used to come over and eat all our snacks. That's how good our snacks were. Jordan is in there, munching on your food? He came over too much. Shoutout to Jordan though,\" the Let's Be Cops actor said of Jordan’s love for the food in their house.\n\nWayans Sr who was also in the interview, shared how his friends were rushing to his house to see Jordan. \"It was amazing to have him,” he said of hosting the five-time NBA MVP.\n\n“All my friends would want to come over, not to see me, but hope to see him, just to get a glimpse of Michael Jordan. One thing I really put my foot down on was 'Don't bother him'. He moved in for the whole summer. I only went over to the house once because he invited me in. Did the fan in me want to be in there every day? Yes, because I could see him from my window,\" he added.\n\nDamon Wayans Sr . starred in the hit sitcom My Wife and Kids, where he played Michael Richard Kyle, a confident yet often outmatched father. In one memorable episode, his character challenged Michael Jordan to a game of one-on-one. Kyle used his ploy of talking trash but as expected the game did not go his way. He only managed to score once before Jordan completely shut him down. He begged for a rematch, but Jordan refused, leaving him humbled and frustrated.\n\nAlso Read: Michael Jordan's son, Marcus Jordan, goes viral after busting out dance moves on courtside date with IG Model Nara Ford\n\nMy Wife and Kids was not the only television appearance of the NBA legend, he has several movies and television series to his resume as an actor which includes, Space Jam and Malcolm X. However, beyond that, Jordan has been very private about his personal life but the insights about his friendship with the Wayans revealed the funny side of the NBA legend.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Budget 2025 income tax expectations: What will the income tax slabs and income tax rates after Union Budget 2025? Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman raise the standard deduction further under the new income tax regime and include popular exemptions like Section 80C, HRA, Section 80D? With the new income tax regime becoming the default tax regime, tax experts believe that no major changes in the old tax regime should be expected. Any rationalisation in income tax slabs, rates and changes in basic exemption limit, rebate etc. can only be expected under the new income tax regime. With that in mind, we take a look at the top 10 income tax expectations of salaried taxpayers and common man from Budget 2025:\n\nBudget 2025 Income Tax Rates & Slabs: The latest income tax slabs under the new income tax regime for FY 2024-25 announced by FM Sitharaman in Budget 2024 were aimed at lowering the tax burden of the common man. With that in mind, experts expect further rationalisation of income tax slabs and rates, with particular focus on shifting the 30% tax slab to income levels above Rs 20 lakh instead of Rs 15 lakh at present. (AI image)\n\nBudget 2025 income tax expectations: Standard deduction under the new income tax regime was hiked to Rs 75,000 from Rs 50,000 last year. Experts are of the view that in the absence of major tax exemptions and deductions in the new tax regime, FM Sitharaman should hike standard deduction further to at least Rs 1 lakh to encourage switch to the new regime. (AI image)\n\nBudget 2025 income tax expectations: Experts predict that due to the government's focus on promoting the new tax regime, the old income tax regime might remain unchanged. Currently, the new tax regime offers a basic exemption threshold of Rs 3 lakh. There are expectations that this threshold could be raised to Rs 5 lakh, which would allow individuals greater disposable income for consumption or savings, consequently stimulating economic growth. (Image source: Freepik)\n\nBudget 2025 income tax expectations: Currently, individuals with taxable income up to Rs 7 lakh are eligible for a complete tax rebate. This fiscal year, there are anticipations of the rebate threshold being raised to Rs 10 lakh. Such a revision under the new income tax regime would offer substantial financial relief to middle-income taxpayers, feel experts. (AI image)\n\nBudget 2025 income tax expectations: Experts advocate for inclusion of the Section 80C exemption under the new income tax regime to encourage savings. Currently the Section 80C exemption limit of up to Rs 1.5 lakh is available under the old income tax regime. (AI image)\n\nBudget 2025 income tax expectations: Tax experts believe that to encourage National Pension System (NPS) adoption, the government should consider making it an EEE product (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt). Additionally, they see a case to include the additional tax benefit of Rs 50,000 for NPS under the old tax regime in the new tax regime as well. (AI image)\n\nBudget 2025 Housing Tax Breaks: Tax experts say the government might enhance tax advantages for property purchasers. Such benefits could encompass higher deductions on housing loan interest or principal payments. At present, individuals can claim losses under income from house property only up to Rs 2 lakhs annually. This ceiling requires revision and could be elevated to Rs 3 lakhs per year, which would strengthen the 'housing for all' programme. (AI image)",

    "title": "'Could hardly speak, poor thing': Sonia Gandhi on President Murmu's address ahead of Budget session",
    "authors": ["TOI News Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Sonia Gandhi expressed concern over President Droupadi Murmu's apparent fatigue during her Budget session address. President Murmu highlighted India's economic progress, paid tribute to former PM Manmohan Singh, and discussed various government initiatives, including housing, healthcare, and financial empowerment for women.\n\nNEW DELHI: Congress leader Sonia Gandhi on Friday reacted to President Droupadi Murmu 's address ahead of the Budget session, saying that the President appeared to become \"tired\" towards the end of her speech and \"could hardly speak.\"\n\n\"The President was getting very tired by the end. She could hardly speak, poor thing,\" Sonia, who attended the joint sitting of both the Houses said while speaking to the reporters.\n\nSonia Gandhi's remark sparks row\n\nSonia Gandhi's remarks ignited controversy, with Bharatiya Janata Party leaders condemning her comments and demanding an apology from the former Congress President.\n\nBJP president Nadda demanded an \"unconditional apology\" from Sonia Gandhi, whilst parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju suggested the opposition's inability to accept a tribal President.\n\n\"The deliberate usage of such words shows the elitist, anti-poor and anti-tribal nature of the Congress Party. I demand that the Congress Party unconditionally apologise to the Honourable President and the tribal communities of India,\" Nadda said in a post on X.\n\nUnion minister Hardeep Singh Puri also lashed out at Sonia calling her comments \"shocking beyond belief\" and accused the Congress of arrogance.\n\n\"Referring to her in such a condescending and derogatory way is appalling. One is beginning to wonder if Congress is a political party in a functioning democracy, or is it a set of entitled and arrogant people with scant respect for institutions of our Republic, including the Head of State. Have they no shame?,\" he questioned.\n\nBJP IT cell head Amit Malviya also criticised Sonia Gandhi’s remarks, arguing they reflect her \"feudal mindset\" and disregard for constitutional values. \"Sonia Gandhi referring to the President as a ‘poor thing’ demeans the high office and reflects her feudal mindset. This is not the first time the Congress has ridiculed the first tribal woman to hold the highest constitutional office in the country. Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition, who frequently flaunts a copy of the Constitution, has not even considered making a courtesy visit to the President. The Congress has no regard for Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s Constitution, constitutional values, or those from socially marginalized backgrounds—namely, Dalits, OBCs, and Tribals. The rot starts at the top.\"\n\n'President should be spared this annual embarrassment': Congress\n\nCongress general secretary KC Venugopal followed Sonia's suit alleged that the president was \"made to deliver a political speech.\"\n\n\"The President was made to deliver a political speech. Nothing is new. Everything is only complete lie and jumla,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Following the President's speech Congress MP Manish Tewari called the address a \"a ritualistic reiteration of a laundry list of the Government’s alleged achievements.\" He added that the President should be \"spared this annual embarrassment.\"\n\n\"The President’s address unfortunately is nothing more than a ritualistic reiteration of a laundry list of the Government’s alleged achievements. The @rashtrapatibhvn should be spared this annual embarrassment. Otherwise the Hon’ble President of India @rashtrapatibhvn should be allowed to speak her or his own mind,\" the Congress MP said.\n\nPM Modi lauds President's speech\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi praised President Murmu’s address, describing it as a “resonant outline” of India’s journey towards becoming a 'Viksit Bharat'. PM Modi highlighted that Murmu's speech provided a clear vision for an India where youth have access to the best opportunities. He noted that her address also laid out inspiring roadmaps for achieving national goals through unity and determination.\n\n\"Today's address by Rashtrapati Ji to both Houses of Parliament was a resonant outline of our nation's path toward building a Viksit Bharat. She highlighted initiatives across sectors and underscored the importance of all-around as well as futuristic development. Her address encapsulated the vision for an India where youth have the best opportunities to flourish. The address also included inspiring roadmaps for achieving the goals we have set with a spirit of unity and determination,\" PM Modi wrote in a post on X.\n\nPresident addresses Joint Session\n\nDuring her address President Murmu, said that India was on track to becoming the world’s third-largest economy. She reaffirmed the government’s commitment to inclusive growth, saying, \"My government's mantra is 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas'.\"\n\nShe arrived at Parliament in a traditional horse-drawn buggy before beginning her speech with a tribute to India’s Constitution makers. \"Two months ago, we celebrated 75 years of adopting our Constitution, and a few days ago, we completed our journey of 75 years. On behalf of all Indians, I bow down to Babasaheb Ambedkar and all others in the Constitution Committee,\" Murmu said.\n\nThe President also paid homage to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who passed away last year, acknowledging his decade-long tenure as the nation’s leader and his longstanding parliamentary career.\n\nShe addressed the recent stampede at the Mahakumbh in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj, where 30 people lost their lives, offering condolences to the victims' families. \"Mahakumbh is a festival of India's cultural identity and social enlightenment. Crores of devotees have already taken the holy dip. I express grief over the incident that occurred on Mouni Amavasya and pray for the speedy recovery of the injured,\" she said.\n\nMurmu outlined several government initiatives, including housing and healthcare schemes. She announced the construction of three crore additional houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and an extension of the Ayushman Bharat Scheme to provide health insurance for six crore senior citizens above the age of 70. \"Every year, they will receive a health cover of five lakh rupees,\" she said.\n\nThe President also talked about the government’s push for women-led development, citing key schemes such as the National Rural Livelihood Mission, which has empowered over 10 crore women through self-help groups. She highlighted the ‘Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam’, ensuring women’s reservation in legislatures, and the ‘Lakhpati Didi’ initiative, aimed at creating financially independent women. \"Today, over 1.15 crore Lakhpati Didis are leading dignified lives, with about 50 lakh joining this category in just the past six months,\" Murmu said.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "authors": ["TOI News Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Congress MP Shashi Tharoor dismissed US President Donald Trump's tariff threats against BRICS nations, citing an absence of plans to replace the US dollar with an alternative currency. Trump reiterated his stance on maintaining dollar dominance, warning BRICS nations of severe economic repercussions if they sought alternatives.\n\nNEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor dismissed US President Donald Trump's tariff threats against Brics nations , labeling them \"a bit empty\", citing the absence of plans to introduce an alternative to the US dollar .\n\nTharoor described the dollar as a \"practical convenience\" for most nations, indicating that Brics has not made a substantial proposal to establish an alternative currency .\n\nAddressing Trump's tariff threats, Tharoor said, \"I heard this comment by President Trump. But, the fact is there is no serious proposal for the Brics to come up with an alternative currency to the dollar. The dollar is a practical convenience for most countries in the world.\"\n\n\"There may have been some discussion, and we certainly have in the past had some examples of Rupee-Rubel trade with Russia, Rupee-Riyal trade with Iran, and so on. So, that's not impossible. An alternative international currency. I don't think there is any particular plan whatsoever to do that. And therefore, the threats of the president seem a bit empty because it's only if there is an actual proposal that comes up and that countries like India are taking it seriously. I don't see any support in the Indian government for such a proposal. So, until that happens, why should we worry,\" he added.\n\nTharoor's comments come after Trump's renewed warnings to Brics nations regarding potential currency alternatives.\n\nTrump warned on Truth Social: \"The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar, while we stand by and watch, is over. We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile Countries that they will neither create a new Brics Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 per cent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy. They can go find another sucker Nation. There is no chance that BRICS will replace the US Dollar in International Trade, or anywhere else, and any Country that tries should say hello to Tariffs, and goodbye to America!\"\n\nThis statement reinforced Trump's position on maintaining the dollar's dominance in global trade, suggesting significant economic repercussions for nations seeking alternatives.\n\nAt the Oval Office signing ceremony, Trump declared, \"As a Brics nation... they'll have a 100 per cent tariff if they so much as even think about doing what they thought, and therefore they'll give it up immediately.\"\n\nResponding to former President Biden's comments, Trump asserted American dominance, stating: \"It's not even a threat. In fact, since I made that statement, Biden said, they have us over a barrel. I said, No, we have them over a barrel. And there's no way they're going to be able to do that.\"\n\nThese warnings follow Trump's previous statements before becoming the 47th President, threatening 100 per cent tariffs on Brics nations' imports if they introduced a new currency.\n\nDuring the 15th Brics Summit in 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin advocated for de-dollarisation , suggesting BRICS nations should increase national currency settlements and strengthen banking cooperation.\n\nIn June 2024, Brics foreign ministers convened in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod, supporting increased use of local currencies in trade and financial transactions between member countries.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "The anointment of film actress Mamta Kulkarni as Mahamandeleshwar by Kinnar Akhara has caused internal disputes. Rishi Ajaydas, claiming to be the founder, removed Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi from her post for procedural violations. Tripathi dismissed the claims, stating Ajaydas is not a member and legal action will be taken.\n\nPRAYAGRAJ: Anointing film actress Mamta Kulkarni as Mahamandeleshwar by Kinnar Akhara has caused ripples and surfaced internal rifts and differences within the akhara.\n\nIn a dramatic move, Rishi Ajaydas, one who claims to be the founding member of Kinnar Akhara, posted a letter on social media in which he has removed Acharya Mahamandeleshwar of Kinnar Akhara, Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi, from the said post.\n\nThe action against Tripathi was taken by the founder for making Mamta Kulkarni Mahamandeleshwar of the akhara, a process that defied the rules and regulations of making someone Mahamandeleshwar, said Das who heads a ashram in Hasampura, Ujjai, Madhya Pradesh.\n\n\"Tripathi did not do any religious work or anything that could uplift the Eunuch (Kinnar) society. Rather, making an actress Mahamandeleshwar, and that too a person who left the country as a traitor, forced me to take this action,\" said Rishi Ajaydas while talking to TOI on the phone. Das claimed that he founded the akhara in Ujjain Kumbh, way back in 2016.\n\nAlso known as Computer Baba, Das was also the coordinator of Kinnar Akhara during Simhastha (Ujjain Kumbh), 2016 and had invited a number of celebs in the first appearance of Kinnar Akhara in any Kumbh.\n\nDas also said that the contract signed by Tripathi in 2019, merging Kinnar Akhara with Juna Akhara, is unconstitutional and stands no ground. In fact, it amounts to forgery done by Tripathi.\n\nHowever, the Acharya Mahamandeleshwar of Kinnar Akhara, Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi, termed his letter as 'a piece of trash'. \"He is not even a member of the akhara, which was registered by me, and a letter issued by him deserves nothing more than a dustbin,\" said Tripathi, while reacting to the letter issued by Das. Since he is not a member of the akhara, what ground does he stand on to issue such a letter, questions Tripathi. The Acharya Mahamandeleshwar has also said that legal action will be taken against Das for circulating a letter which has baseless allegations.\n\nCommenting on the developments, the international spokesperson of the Juna Akhara, Mahamandeleshwar Narain Giri, said, \"Kinnar Akhara is part of Juna Akhara, and Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi is the Acharya Mahamandeleshwar of the said akhara as far as our opinion is concerned.\"\n\nWhen asked about how correct it was to anoint Mamta Kulkarni as Mahamandeleshwar, the spokesperson said, \"It is up to the head of Kinnar Akhara to decide whom to make Mahamandeleshwar, and Ajaydas has absolutely no say in the affairs of the Kinnar Akhara.\"\n\nIn addition to this, Mahant Durga Das, who also claims to be the founder member of Kinnar Akhara, said, “One individual cannot overthrow the Acharya Mahamandeleshwar from the post, Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, was, is and will remain the head of the Kinnar Akhara.”\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Despite summons, Baba Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna have not appeared in court for misleading advertisements. Multiple cases were filed against them, with bailable warrants issued, yet they remained absent. The Supreme Court warns states of contempt for not acting against such ads under the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, 1956.\n\nBaba Ramdev and Patanjali MD Acharya Balkrishna (File photo)\n\nThree years after Patanjali published misleading advertisements, the accused, Baba Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna, have not appeared in any court despite summons being issued in cases filed against them. Their lawyer appeared in a Palakkad court for two cases just a week after a bailable warrant was issued against them in one of the cases in the same court. In a Haridwar court, none of the accused turned up for four hearings despite summons, but no action has been taken.\n\nOn January 15, the Supreme Court warned states and union territories of contempt proceedings for failing to act against misleading advertisements. The issue of misleading advertisement came up when the court was hearing a case filed by the Indian Medical Association against Patanjali Ayurved Ltd alleging a smear campaign against modern medicine by the company and its proprietors. The apex court took up the issue of misleading ads being published or displayed in violation of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954. A senior lawyer appointed to assist the court informed the court that affidavits filed by states and union territories showed that virtually no action was being taken for violation of the 1954 law.\n\nDespite Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist, flagging the misleading ads as a violation of DMR(OA), 1956 as far back as 2021, Patanjali and Baba Ramdev continued with the ads. “After the written assurance on 7th May 2022 that they have stopped the Ads, Divya pharmacy (a part of the Patanjali group) published objectionable Ads 53 times till 28th March 2023 as per the written reply by the ayush minister in the parliament,” tweeted Dr Babu in April last year.\n\nThe ads included drugs which claimed to cure/treat several conditions including diabetes, glaucoma, goitre, high/low blood pressure and cholesterol. Under section (d) of the DMR (OA) Act, 1956, there is a list of 54 conditions including diabetes, cataract, glaucoma, high or low blood pressure and heart diseases for which advertisement claiming cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention is prohibited.\n\nBased on Dr Babu’s complaints, 29 cases were registered in different districts in Kerala and the first case was filed in Haridwar only on April 16, 2024 after the intervention of the Supreme Court. The case was listed by the Haridwar court eight times and the judge was unavailable on three occasions and the accused was absent on four occasions. The next date is on March 24, 2025.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the accused will appear at the next hearing of the three cases in Palakkad. The first case in which a bailable warrant was issued is coming up on February 1. The other two cases, in which a lawyer appeared for the accused, are to be heard on February 27. In the Kochi case hearing on January 29, \"all accused entered appearance\" which means that they have signified they are participating in the case even if they did not make a physical apearance. There are many more related cases coming up in February.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "title": "'CEC chose to hound me': Arvind Kejriwal's response to EC on 'Yamuna poison' row",
    "authors": ["TOI News Desk"],
    "raw_text": "The Election Commission of India held a special meeting with Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal regarding his allegations of water poisoning by the BJP-led Haryana government. Kejriwal was asked to provide evidence to support his claims about the deliberate contamination of the Yamuna River, which could lead to mass casualties in Delhi.\n\nNEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal hit out at the Election Commission of India (ECI) calling the CEC Rajiv Kumar's response over the Yamuna River water row \"baffling\". Reiterating his \"Yamuna poisoning\" charges over the BJP-led Haryana government, in a letter written to EC, he dared the poll panel to take action and impose punishment against Nayab Singh Saini.\n\nKejriwal's letter to poll panel\n\nIn his letter, Kejriwal raised serious allegations against Saini and demanded that a criminal case should be filed against him regarding the 'poisonous' Yamuna issue. Kejriwal also claimed that the water being supplied from Haryana to Delhi has high levels of ammonia.\n\nPoll\n\nWhat Do You Think Is the Most Important Factor When Choosing a Political Leader in an Election?\n\nTrack Record and Past Contributions to Society Leadership Skills and Ability to Bring Change\n\n'Ammonia levels started increasing very sharply'\n\nAAP national convenor alleged that the ammonia levels started increasing very sharply from 15 Jan onwards (around 3.2 ppm on 15 Jan) and reached 7 ppm a few days later.\n\nKejriwal alleged that Delhi CM Atishi contacted Saini to resolve the crises, but despite several attempts, the issues remained unresolved.\n\n\"The chief minister of Delhi called up the chief minister of Haryana in the last week of December and requested him to either take steps to reduce ammonia or provide additional water to dilute it. Though CM Haryana assured me that he would take the necessary steps, however, he did not. Subsequently, CM Delhi again called him several times. After a few calls, CM Haryana stopped taking CM Delhi's calls,\" as said in the letter.\n\n'Haryana CM orchestrated a 'conspiracy'' alleges Kejriwal\n\nAttacking the Haryana chief minister, Kejriwal said that Saini orchestrated a 'conspiracy' to influence the Delhi assembly election .\n\n\"There was a deliberate conspiracy on the part of Haryana CM, who happens to be from BJP, to influence Delhi elections by sending highly polluted waters to Delhi. He knew very well that this would create artificial water scarcity in Delhi, whose blame would lie on the AAP government in Delhi. This would have rendered almost half of Delhi without water and would have created huge public misery for almost 10 million people of Delhi who would have gone without water,\" he said in the letter.\n\n\"If no action is taken against the Haryana government and the BJP leaders involved in corrupt practices it will be amply clear to everyone that the CEC keeps the interest of the ruling party over public interest. Unfortunately, I can't be expected to be silent on this and tow this line out of fear or expectations of favour. My only concern is the health and safety of the people of Delhi and I will fight for the protection of our democratic principles. Whatever illegal punishment you may wish to impose on me under the instruction of the BJP is a small price to pay for it, and I welcome it with open arms,\" he added.\n\n'Rajiv Kumar's response baffling', says Kejriwal\n\nLevelling up his attack, he termed the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar's response \"baffling\". \"The alacrity with which CEC has acted against me when I was merely acting on an issue of very high public importance and have averted a huge public crisis in Delhi is baffling. Equally baffling is CEC's refusal to direct Haryana to stop polluting Delhi's waters,\" the letter reads.\n\n'CEC chose to hound me'\n\n\"I am also shocked that the CEC did not pass any orders directing Haryana CM to stop polluting Delhi's waters right before elections. Rather, CEC chose to hound me,\" he added in a letter.\n\nEC met Kejriwal as a \"special case\"\n\nAfter the meeting with Kejriwal, the Commission in its reaction said that it gave a patient hearing to the AAP chief at a very short notice today and received his reply.\n\n\"The full Commission, without getting swayed by personal insinuations and offensive strategy being in play, decided to examine the reply in detail and take decision(s) on merit,\" EC said.\n\nThe Yamuna River water row\n\nToday's meeting came in the backdrop of EC's notice to Kejriwal asking him to provide evidence of his allegations that the Haryana government has \"poisoned\" the water supply to Delhi.\n\nThe Yamuna water issue has emerged as a crucial political matter ahead of the Delhi assembly election, with Kejriwal pointing fingers at the BJP-led Haryana government for deliberately contaminating the water. The ECI had requested Kejriwal to present concrete evidence supporting these allegations by 11 am today.\n\nA day before, the Election Commission advised Kejriwal against conflating the increased ammonia levels in the Yamuna River with his allegations about deliberate poisoning and mass genocide.\n\nThe commission offered Kejriwal another chance to prove his claims, requesting specific details about the alleged poisoning, including type, quantity, nature, and detection methods used by Delhi Jal Board engineers.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Kejriwal made serious accusations against the BJP, claiming that the BJP-governed Haryana deliberately contaminated Delhi's water supply to cause fatalities and shift blame to AAP.\n\n\"If this water would have entered Delhi only to be mixed with the drinking water, many people would have died in Delhi. It would have caused mass genocide,\" Kejriwal had alleged.\n\nHis remarks have sparked significant political controversy, drawing criticism from BJP leaders.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "title": "NMC finally decides it will take up patients’ appeals against state council rulings",
    "authors": ["Rema Nagarajan"],
    "raw_text": "Representative photo\n\nIn a victory for patients’ rights, the National Medical Commission has decided that it will take up appeals of patients in cases against doctors. For almost five years, since the NMC was constituted in September 2020, it has been rejecting patients’ appeals stating that only doctors have the right to appeal against decisions of state medical councils . However, the NMC decision is yet to be made public.\n\nPoll\n\nWhich Is the Best Approach to Ensure Fairness in Medical Negligence Cases?\n\nLet Medical Councils Have the Final Say Allow Patients to Appeal for Better Accountability\n\nThe minutes of the NMC meeting held on September 23, 2024, obtained through the right to information, showed that the NMC had agreed that all appeals received by its Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) will be entertained. In case of action not being taken by state councils on complaints filed by non-medicos (read patients or their families) even after issuance of reminders by the boards, it was decided that EMRB may take over the complaint/matter from the state council and dispose of it.\n\nThe NMC was refusing to hear patients’ appeal citing section 30(3) of the NMC Act 2019 . The Section states: A medical practitioner or professional who is aggrieved by any action taken by a State Medical Council under sub-section (2) may prefer an appeal to the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB)against such action, and the decision, if any, of the Ethics and Medical Registration Board thereupon shall be binding on the State Medical Council, unless a second appeal is preferred under sub-section(4).” The EMRB and the NMC reiterated that the law only allowed medical practitioners aggrieved by decisions of state councils to appeal.\n\n“I have been repeatedly arguing that patients have the right to appeal against decisions of state medical council under the ethics regulations of 2002, which have been in force all through,” said Dr KV Babu an ophthalmologist and RTI activist, who has been following up the issue through RTI applications and complaints to the ministry and the NMC since 2022.\n\nClause 8.8 of the ethics regulations of 2002 states that “any person aggrieved by the decision of the state medical council on any complaint against a delinquent physician, shall have the right to file an appeal to the MCI within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of the order passed by the said medical council”. This clause was added to the Code of Conduct Regulations 2002 following a 2003 order of the Supreme Court in a writ petition filed in 2000. Before the case in 2000, even the Indian Medical Council Act 1956, under which the erstwhile Medical Council of India functioned, allowed only medical practitioners the right to appeal.\n\nResponding to several complaints from patients, the health ministry added a provision for patients to appeal in the draft of the National Medical Commission (Amendment) Bill 2022, which was made public in December 2022. However, the bill has remained in limbo.\n\nOn August 2, 2023, the NMC brought in the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023 to replace the ethics regulation of 2002. However, in the face of huge protests from doctors and the pharmaceutical and medical device industry against the new regulations, which stipulated generic prescription, the NMC announced on August 23, 2023, that the new regulations were being held in abeyance with immediate effect. Along with this, EMRB notified that Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 was being adopted and made effective “as if the same have been made by the commission by virtue of the powers vested under the NMC Act 2019”.\n\nDespite the 2002 regulation coming into effect, the EMRB continued to reject the appeals of patients claiming that section 8.8 of the 2002 Regulations was abolished on September 25, 2020, after all the provisions of the NMC Act, 2019 came into force.\n\n“The NMC Act states that 'the rules and regulations made under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, shall continue to be in force and operate till new standards or requirements are specified under this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder'. The ethics code was not replaced by the NMC, except briefly in August 2023. Otherwise, clause 8.8. of the 2002 regulations has been in operation right from the inception of the NMC. So, the NMC's decision to disallow appeals of non-doctors was always illegal. I am happy that finally better sense has prevailed,” said Dr Babu. Over the years, over a hundred patient appeals have been rejected.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

Organizers are considering alternative venues unless an Indian investor steps forward. Talks with Indian tycoon Anand Mahindra did not yield support as his focus remains on the Global Chess League.\n\n(PTI Photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: India risks losing the opportunity to host reigning World Chess Champion D Gukesh in the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour due to a lack of investor interest. With no confirmed financial backing, tournament organizers are now considering alternative venues, TimesofIndia.com has learnt.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com ahead of the German leg of the tour, Freestyle Chess co-founder Jan Henric Buettner has hinted that India could be dropped from the tournament calendar for the 2025 edition.\n\nCurrently, the official website lists New Delhi as the host city for the fourth and penultimate leg of the tour. However, Buettner has made it clear that unless a suitable investor from India steps forward soon, the venue will be changed.\n\n\"Delhi is the only tournament we haven't finalised yet because we are receiving offers from other cities. They are offering hosting fees. If we get a seven or eight-figure offer from another location, of course, we'll go there,\" Buettner said.\n\nThe 2025 Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour is set to begin on February 7 in Weissenhaus, Germany, where the world's top ten chess players, including World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura , Fabiano Caruana and Gukesh, will compete next week.\n\nFollowing the German leg (February 7-14), the tour will move to Paris (April 8-15), New York (July 17-24), and then — currently — New Delhi (September 17-24), before concluding in Cape Town (December 5-12).\n\nTimesofIndia.com understands that FIDE and Freestyle Chess are in discussions to potentially turn the September leg of the tour into an open tournament.\n\nWhen asked why India remains listed as the host for the fourth leg, Buettner explained, \"We've kept it as a placeholder until we secure an alternative venue.\"\n\nHe also revealed that he had reached out to Indian business tycoon Anand Mahindra for potential support. \"I personally spoke to Anand Mahindra in London, but his focus is on the Global Chess League, and he isn't currently interested in other chess ventures,\" added the German.\n\nAs the reigning World Chess Champion, Gukesh, 18, is the only player guaranteed participation across all venues during the tour.\n\nThe rest of the tournament roster will see some changes throughout the year, with players qualifying through ELO rankings, wildcard entries, and direct invitations, making it one of the most interesting competitions of the year.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Starting February 1, 2025, UPI transactions with special characters in transaction IDs will be declined to ensure compliance with technical specifications and improve platform safety. Users should update their UPI apps to avoid disruptions, as non-compliant IDs will be rejected automatically.\n\nThe National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has announced that starting February 1, 2025, UPI transactions containing special characters in their transaction IDs will be declined. This new rule requires all UPI transaction IDs to be strictly alphanumeric, meaning any transaction ID containing special characters such as @, !, or # will be automatically rejected by the system.\n\nThe decision aims to ensure compliance with UPI's technical specifications and improve the overall safety of the digital payments platform. NPCI had previously issued a circular in March 2024 instructing all UPI participants to generate transaction IDs using only alphanumeric characters. Despite efforts to improve compliance, some ecosystem participants have continued to generate transaction IDs with special characters.\n\nNPCI has advised all UPI members to take necessary action and inform relevant stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition. Users are encouraged to check their UPI apps for updates and ensure their transaction IDs comply with the new rules to avoid disruptions.\n\nRead the circular here\n\nReference may be taken from our OC 193 dated 28th March 2024 wherein UPI ecosystem players were advised to use only alphanumeric characters for generating UP| transaction ID. This is to ensure compliance with UPI technical specifications.\n\nWe have been working with the ecosystem to improve compliance, though the issue has been largely resolved, it is observed that a few of the participants continue to be non-compliant.\n\nConsidering the criticality of compliance to the specifications, it has been decided not to allow any special characters in UPI transaction ID. Any transaction with ID containing special characters shall be declined by the central system.\n\nThis shall be effective 1st February 2025A. All participating entities are advised to take note of the above and ensure compliance. The information herein may please be disseminated to all the concerned for necessary action.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nLatest Mobiles\n\nView All\n\nItel Zeno 10\n\n₹5,699\n\nView Specs\n\nItel A80\n\n₹6,999\n\nView Specs\n\nPoco X7 5G\n\n₹21,999\n\nView Specs\n\nPoco X8 5G\n\n₹29,990\n\nView Specs\n\nInfinix Smart 9 HD\n\n₹6,699\n\nView Specs\n\nMotorola Moto G05\n\n₹6,999\n\nView Specs\n\nVivo Y29 5G\n\n₹13,999\n\nView Specs\n\nPoco X7 Pro 5G\n\n₹27,999\n\nView Specs\n\nRealme 14 Pro 5G\n\n₹24,999\n\nView Specs\n\nRealme 14 Pro Plus 5G\n\n₹29,999\n\nView Specs",

What MEA said\n\nTahawwur Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, is accused of involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, including six Americans. He has been linked to Pakistani-American terrorist David Coleman Headley , a key conspirator in the attacks. India had requested his extradition from the US, a move that was supported by the US government. However, Rana repeatedly challenged the decision in American courts.\n\nHis appeals against extradition were rejected by lower courts, and in August 2023, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the India-US Extradition Treaty allowed for his extradition. Rana then filed a petition with the US Supreme Court to block the decision. The US Solicitor General urged the court to reject his plea, reinforcing the US government's stance in favor of India's extradition request.\n\nOn January 25, the US Supreme Court denied Rana’s final petition, effectively clearing the way for his extradition to India. With this ruling, Rana is now set face trial in India.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

It has clearly hurt the dignity of the high office and are unacceptable,\" the Rashtrapati Bhavan said in a statement.\n\nThe President's office was reacting to Sonia Gandhi's remarks that went viral after the President concluded her address. \"The poor lady, the President, was getting very tired by the end ... she could hardly speak, poor thing,\" Sonia Gandhi was heard saying in the video.\n\nPoll\n\nWhat Do You Think About Sonia Gandhi’s Critical Remark?\n\nUnnecessary Remark Fair Criticism\n\nThe Rashtrapati Bhavan issued a strongly-worded statement refuting Sonia Gandhi's claims without taking her name. It asserted that the President was not tired at any point.\n\n\"While reacting to the media on the Hon'ble President's Address to the Parliament, some prominent leaders of the Congress party have made comments that clearly hurt the dignity of the high office, and therefore are unacceptable. These leaders have said that the President was getting very tired by the end and she could hardly speak,\" the Rashtrapati Bhavan statement read.\n\n\"These leaders have said that the President was getting very tired by the end and she could hardly speak. Rashtrapati Bhavan would like to clarify that nothing could be farther from the truth. The President was not tired at any point. Indeed, she has believed that speaking up for the marginalised communities, for women and farmers, as she was doing during the course of her address, can never be tiring,\" the statement added.\n\nEarlier, Sonia's remarks kicked up a storm with the BJP launching an all-out offensive against the Congress. Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP called Sonia Gandhi's remarks on President Droupadi Murmu \"deeply disrespectful\" and an insult to the tribals.\n\n\"Look at Congress \"shaahi parivaar's\" arrogance, it insulted President Droupadi Murmu who comes from tribal background. Congress insults all those who progress from among poor, Dalits, tribals, OBCs,\" the Prime Minister said leading the charge against the Congress at a rally in Delhi.\n\nBJP national president JP Nadda said in a post on X, \"Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi's use of the phrase 'poor thing' to refer to the President is deeply disrespectful and underscores the opposition's continued disregard for the dignity of the highest constitutional office.\"\n\nHowever, the Congress leaders strongly defended Sonia and accused the BJP and a section of the media of twisting her words. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge asserted that his party always respected the dignity of the office of the President and that in order to hide the bad state of the economy, BJP leaders and a section of the media are twisting the phrase used by Sonia Gandhi.\n\n\"Her Excellency the President was insulted by the Modi government on the very day when he was not invited to the inauguration ceremony of the new Parliament,\" Kharge said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\n\"The Indian National Congress and our leaders can never insult Her Excellency the President or any citizen. This is not our culture. The BJP had deliberately kept our current President and previous President away from both the Temple of Democracy and the Ram Temple,\" he said.\n\nThe Congress chief alleged that the BJP deliberately kept the current President and her predecessor, Ram Nath Kovind, away from both Parliament and Ram temple in Ayodhya.\n\nCongress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said her mother has the utmost respect for the President and that it is very unfortunate that her remarks have been \"twisted by the media\".\n\n\"My mother is a 78-year-old lady. She simply said that 'the President must have been tired reading such a long speech, poor thing'. She fully respects, in fact, she has the utmost respect for her (the President). It is very unfortunate that this kind of a thing is twisted by the media,\" Priyanka told reporters.\n\n\"They are both respected people, they are older than us, they are at a certain age now and it is pretty clear that she (Sonia Gandhi) means no disrespect,\" the Congress MP said while exiting the Parliament House complex after attending a committee meeting.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "A new report warns that increasing competition among tech giants could lead to the malicious use of AI systems. AI advancements, particularly from the Chinese startup DeepSeek, emphasize the need for safety and ethical considerations to prevent risks in cybersecurity and bioweapon development.\n\nA new report by experts has warned about how the increasing competition among tech majors may boost the malicious use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The report’s lead author, Yoshua Bengio , also known as “one of the godfathers of modern AI,” highlighted the risks associated with the rapid advancement of AI technology, particularly with the emergence of companies like DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that has challenged US dominance in the field. He expressed concerns about DeepSeek 's rapid progress, emphasising the need for greater attention to safety and ethical considerations in AI development. Bengio has also warned that competitors, including US companies, may start prioritising regaining their lead by compromising safety.\n\nWhat the ‘godfather of AI’ said about the AI race\n\nin an interview with the Guardian, Bengio said: “It’s going to mean a closer race, which usually is not a good thing from the point of view ofAI safety. If you imagine a competition between two entities and one thinks they’re way ahead, then they can afford to be more prudent and still know that they will stay ahead. Whereas if you have a competition between two entities and they think that the other is just at the same level, then they need to accelerate. Then maybe they don’t give as much attention to safety.”\n\nThe first full International AI Safety report, led by Turing Award winner Yoshua Bengio and compiled by 96 experts, was announced at the 2023 AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park.\n\nCommissioned by the UK government, the report highlights the increasing risks posed by AI, including its potential for malicious use in cybersecurity and bioweapons development.\n\nIt warns that AI can now generate detailed instructions for creating biological threats, surpassing expert capabilities. However, its impact on novices remains uncertain.\n\nWhile acknowledging risks, the report also emphasises AI’s benefits, particularly in medicine. The next global AI summit is set for February in Paris.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nLatest Mobiles\n\nView All\n\nItel Zeno 10\n\n₹5,699\n\nView Specs\n\nItel A80\n\n₹6,999\n\nView Specs\n\nPoco X7 5G\n\n₹21,999\n\nView Specs\n\nPoco X8 5G\n\n₹29,990\n\nView Specs\n\nInfinix Smart 9 HD\n\n₹6,699\n\nView Specs\n\nMotorola Moto G05\n\n₹6,999\n\nView Specs\n\nVivo Y29 5G\n\n₹13,999\n\nView Specs\n\nPoco X7 Pro 5G\n\n₹27,999\n\nView Specs\n\nRealme 14 Pro 5G\n\n₹24,999\n\nView Specs\n\nRealme 14 Pro Plus 5G\n\n₹29,999\n\nView Specs",

    "title": "BITS School of Management (BITSoM): Shaping Leaders for a Tech",
    "authors": ["Mediawire"],
    "raw_text": "There is fierce demand among organisations for talent that can bring to the table a mix of leadership skills and a comfort with exploiting technology. Leveraging its 60-year BITS Pilani pedigree and the STEM expertise that comes with it, BITSoM infuses soft skills and leadership into the curriculum to produce graduates that fill a key gap in the industry.\n\nIts first academic year beginning in July 2021, BITSoM was set up under the aegis of BITS Pilani – itself established in 1964 and one of the first universities in the private sector to be recognised as an “Institution of Eminence” by the Govt of India in 2020. The b-school combines academic rigour with an innovative approach to the MBA pedagogy – the ‘block teaching method’ that offers concentrated two-week instructions in just one core subject at a time to be able to draw on global pool of teaching talent. Faculty from business schools such as Kellogg, McCombs – University of Texas at Austin, NYU-Stern, Chicago-Booth, SMU-Singapore, Tecnológico de Monterrey etc are reinforce the in-house faculty.\n\nThe global faculty delivers a curriculum designed with an emphasis on technology, drawing on the STEM lineage of its parent BITS Pilani. The b-school has a philosophy of treating tech as a horizontal rather than a vertical, which means that every for discipline of management, it aims to integrate tech aspects into the curriculum. A month-long AI intervention covering AI in finance, marketing, operations, and analytics is the latest innovation in the curriculum. Saravanan Kesavan, Dean and Professor of Operations says “We aim to produce MBA graduates who are the most up-to-date with the impact of AI on business. In addition, we balance intellectual and emotional capabilities with a self-development plan and mentorship for each student. Each BITSoM student will be a self-aware, lifelong learner – a digital ready leader who can analyse, understand, and solve unstructured problems. With new technologies rapidly changing business models and the world of work, our BITS Pilani legacy is a crucial advantage in backing our vision with the resources, knowledge base, and the commitment of our leadership team led by Mr Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chancellor, BITS Pilani and Chairman of the Governing Council of BITSoM.”\n\nWith a belief that self-awareness is the foundation of leadership, each “BITSoMian” as they like to call themselves, has a personal development plan (PDP) that they develop under faculty guidance to identify their goals and the competencies they need to achieve these. The PDP then builds a detailed plan for the student to develop these competencies. Typically, the PDP picks up at a time, one soft skill and one functional area for the student to work on.\n\nWhile BITSoM is just over 3 years old, being part of BITS Pilani connects students to a network of over 186,000 alumni, including 7,400 CEOs and 6,400 founders. The BITS Pilani alumni community is known to be fiercely loyal, tightly knit and influential – led and organised by the BITSAA (BITS Alumni Association) that has over 100 chapters in more than 30 countries across every inhabited continent.\n\nBITSoM operates out of a brand new 60-acre residential campus in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region that has been designed by the architect Hafeez Contractor. Students benefit from a transdisciplinary ecosystem, sharing the campus with BITS Law School and from August 2025, with BITS Design School.\n\nA professional career services team connects students with top recruiters, including many marquee names that are unusual on a campus so new. McKinsey & Co., BCG, Bain, EY, PWC, Deloitte, Aditya Birla Group—for consulting & general management, HUL, Nestle, Pidilite, Hershey’s—in the FMCG sector, JP Morgan, Tata Capital, ICICI Pru AMC, Avista Advisory, Eight Capital—in the BFSI sector, among others have recruited BITSoM students.\n\nBITSoM accepts applications from fresh graduates, and working professionals with a valid CAT, GMAT, or GRE score. The Round 2 application deadline is 26 January 2025. The 2-year residential programme MBA culminates into a degree awarded by BITS Pilani.\n\nApply for 2025 admissions\n\nDisclaimer: Content Produced by BITSOM\n\nStay updated with the latest education news on Times of India.

He accuses AAP of corruption and neglecting Delhi's development, urging voters to support BJP in upcoming elections.\n\nPM Modi addresses rally in Dwarka\n\nNEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday criticised the Aam Aadmi Party and its chief Arvind Kejriwal for \"picking fights with everyone\" and mentioned that Delhi needs \"a government of coordination, not that of conflict\".\n\n\"AAPda is busy picking fights with everyone. They have picked up a fight with the central government, Haryana and UP, and haven't even allowed central schemes to be implemented here in Delhi. Delhi doesn't need a 'takrar wali sarkar', but a 'taalmel wali sarkar',\" PM Modi said.\n\nAddressing an election rally in Delhi's Dwarka, PM also said that Delhi requires a \"double-engine\" government and expressed confidence in BJP's victory. \"Delhi needs a double engine government of the Central and State governments. You saw Congress in power for many years, then \"AAPda\" took over Delhi. You have given me the opportunity to serve the country again and again, now give me a chance to serve Delhi also by forming a double engine government,\" he said.\n\nFurther, taking jabs at the AAP, PM Modi added, \"AAPda people have made Delhi an ATM to shine their politics. AAPda people have squeezed out Delhi's money, looted it. By committing scams in Delhi, these AAP leaders use black money to shine in politics in other states of the country.\"\n\nPM Modi also raised the controversy around AAP's blame on the Haryana government for mixing poison in Yamuna water. \"Seeing the growing anger of Delhi's people towards AAPda, the party has started openly lying. AAPda’s dislike for Haryana is clear, and their actions reflect this. They have blamed Haryana’s farmers whenever Delhi faces pollution problems. Now, they are accusing Haryana of polluting the Yamuna river,\" he said.\n\nRegarding governance transparency, the prime minister also hinted at AAP's reluctance to present CAG reports. He assured that these reports would be tabled in the first Assembly session, suggesting they would expose AAP's alleged misconduct. \"In the very first session of the Assembly, the CAG report will be presented. This report will reveal AAPda’s scams, which is why they are trying to hide it,\" said the PM.\n\nPM Modi urged people to vote in February 5 elections and support BJP, as he criticised Arvind Kejriwal's \"sheesh mahal\" whilst highlighting his own commitment to providing housing for the underprivileged, noting that the AAP government had failed to distribute centrally-funded houses to Delhi's poor. \"The AAP government has not handed over thousands of houses built by the central government to the poor people of Delhi. Those who build \"sheesh mahal\" worth crores for themselves will never understand the pain of the poor,\" he said, claiming the necessity for \"BJP government to be formed here for the houses of the poor.\"\n\nAdditionally, PM Modi alleged that AAP had exploited the city's resources for political advancement in other states. He promised accountability for alleged misappropriated funds upon BJP forming the government.\n\nThe Prime Minister pointed out AAP's confrontational approach with various entities, including the central government and neighbouring states, suggesting this hampered Delhi's development. He showcased the Yashobhoomi MICE facility in Dwarka as an example of BJP's vision for modernisation. \"A glimpse of the extent to which BJP wants to make Delhi modern can be seen here in Dwarka. The central government constructed a magnificent Yashobhoomi here. Because of Yashobhoomi, thousands of youth from Dwarka and Delhi have got employment and the business of the people has grown here. In the coming time, this entire area will be a kind of smart city,\" he said.\n\nPM Modi also claimed that AAP neglected infrastructure development, claiming they prioritised advertising over public welfare. He concluded by requesting support for establishing a BJP government in Delhi, promising dedicated service to the city's development.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized Congress after Sonia Gandhi called President Murmu's Budget session speech 'boring' and described the President as 'tired'. Modi labeled this an insult to the tribal community and the poor. BJP leaders demanded an apology from Congress, while Rashtrapati Bhavan condemned the remarks for undermining the high office's dignity.\n\nNEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday latched on to veteran leader Sonia Gandhi's remark on President Murmu to attack Congress, accusing the grand-old party of insulting the tribal community and a woman in the highest post of the country.\n\nWhile addressing a rally in Delhi's Dwarka, PM said that the \"royal family of Congress\" found the speech of a tribal daughter boring.\n\n\"Droupadi Murmu has risen from a tribal family in the forests of Odisha to reach here. Her native language is not Hindi; she was raised speaking Odia. Despite Hindi not being her first language, she delivered an inspiring speech in Parliament today. However, the royal family of Congress has resorted to insulting her. A member of the royal family said that the tribal daughter gave a boring speech, and another member went even further by calling the President a \"poor thing,\" \"poor,\" \"a thing,\" and \"tired.\" They find a tribal daughter's speech boring,\" PM Modi said.\n\n\"This is an insult to the 20 crore tribal brothers and sisters of the country. It is an insult to every poor person in the country who rises from the ground. The royal family of Congress does not like those who rise from poverty, Dalit, tribal, or OBC backgrounds,\" he added.\n\nPM Modi, further, trained guns at Rahul Gandhi saying Congress leaders find the President's speech boring and prefer to insult the country abroad.\n\n\"They insult such people at every step. Economic progress, farmers' prosperity, metro roads, airports, startups, the happiness of athletes—these were described in her speech today. They find these topics boring, preferring to insult people, defame India abroad, and talk about urban Naxalites,\" he said.\n\nA political slugfest erupted after Rajya Sabha MP Sonia Gandhi reacted to President Murmu's address ahead of the Budget session, saying that the President appeared to become \"tired\" towards the end of her speech and \"could hardly speak.\"\n\n\"The President was getting very tired by the end. She could hardly speak, poor thing,\" Sonia, who attended the joint sitting of both the Houses said while speaking to the reporters.\n\nSonia Gandhi's remarks ignited controversy, with Bharatiya Janata Party leaders condemning her comments and demanding an apology from the former Congress President. BJP president Nadda demanded an \"unconditional apology\" from Sonia Gandhi, whilst parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju suggested the opposition's inability to accept a tribal President.\n\n\"The deliberate usage of such words shows the elitist, anti-poor and anti-tribal nature of the Congress Party. I demand that the Congress Party unconditionally apologise to the Honourable President and the tribal communities of India,\" Nadda said in a post on X.\n\nRashtrapati Bhavan also condemned the recent remarks made by Congress leaders said that the comments were \"in poor taste\" and \"hurt the dignity of the high office\".\n\nRashtrapati Bhavan issued a statement saying that the remarks \"clearly hurt the dignity of the high office, and therefore are unacceptable.\" It reaffirmed that the President’s speech reflected the government’s commitment to inclusive development, national security, and economic growth.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "title": "Economic Survey 2025 warns: US market correction may have 'cascading effect' on Indian stock market",
    "authors": ["TOI Business Desk"],
    "raw_text": "The Economic Survey 2025 highlights potential risks for the Indian stock market due to elevated valuations in the US market, with recent retail investor trends adding to concerns. Historical data shows that US market corrections significantly impact Indian markets, necessitating increased vigilance.\n\nIt remains important to consider the potential impact of a US market downturn, considering past patterns. (AI image)\n\nEconomic Survey 2024-2025 : Is the Indian stock market headed for a meaningful correction in 2025? The Economic Survey 2025 tabled in Parliament ahead of Budget 2025 has pointed to risks for the Indian stock market in 2025, especially in light of possible corrections in the US stock market.\n\nThe Economic Survey has flagged risks saying, “Elevated valuations and optimistic market sentiments in the US raise the likelihood of a meaningful market correction in 2025. Should such a correction occur, it could have a cascading effect on India, especially given the increased participation of young, relatively new retail investors.”\n\n“Many of these investors that have entered the market post-pandemic have never witnessed a significant and prolonged market correction. Hence, if one were to occur, its impact on sentiment and spending may be non-trivial,” the Economic Survey says.\n\nPoll\n\nDo You Think the Indian Stock Market Will Face a Meaningful Correction in 2025?\n\nNo, India’s Market Will Remain Resilient Yes, Due to Potential US Market Risks\n\nUS markets at a record high\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, the US stock market displays notable characteristics: elevated stock valuations, peak corporate earnings and widespread investor optimism. Given that the United States represents 75 per cent of the MSCI World Index (as of November 2024), any downward movement in its markets could significantly impact global markets, including India, necessitating careful monitoring, the Economic Survey warns.\n\nAccording to the Economic Survey, concerns are rising regarding the durability of US corporate profits, especially considering their concentration amongst select major technology companies and their reliance on robust government expenditure, which increased by 10 per cent year-on-year to USD 6.75 trillion45 between October 2023 and September 2024.\n\nUS Corporate Profits vs non-tech corporate profits\n\nAdditionally, investors' appetite for structured and sophisticated financial instruments, deriving returns from alternative assets like data centres, music catalogues and solar panel revenues, has reached its highest point since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).\n\nIndian Stock Markets: The Growth in Numbers\n\nSince the pandemic's beginning, Indian equity markets have maintained consistent performance, influenced by various domestic factors beyond global trends. A significant development has been the substantial increase in retail involvement during the past five years, which includes both investor numbers and market activities.\n\nParticipation of individual investors during the 2008 GFC and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic\n\nAt the National Stock Exchange (NSE), unique investors exceeded 10 crore in August 2024, showing a threefold increase over four years, reaching 10.9 crore by December 26, 2024. Client codes at NSE, representing investor accounts, expanded from approximately six crore in late 2019 to nearly 21 crore by December 2024.\n\nTrading activity statistics show that monthly active traders in NSE's cash segment grew from about 32 lakh in January 2020 to approximately 1.4 crore by November 2024. Individual investment patterns demonstrate increased market engagement.\n\nFollowing an 11-year period of minimal activity, individual investors became net purchasers in 2020, with growing involvement thereafter.\n\nDuring 2020-24, individuals invested ₹4.4 lakh crore net in NSE's cash segment, with 2024 (January-November 2024) recording peak net inflows of ₹1.5 lakh crore.\n\nCombined with substantial mutual fund participation, this compensated for fluctuating FPI outflows. Individual investors' direct and mutual fund-based ownership reached 17.6 per cent (September 2024) in NSE-listed firms, matching FPI levels, compared to a 7.1 percentage point difference in FY21.\n\nThe increased individual participation, alongside strong equity performance surpassing other investments, has generated substantial household wealth recently. NSE calculations indicate household wealth in Indian equities increased by over ₹40 lakh crore during 2020-2024 (as of September 2024).\n\nIndia de-linked to US markets? What history tells us\n\nThe increasing retail investor participation corresponds with a noticeable reduction in the 5-year rolling beta between the Nifty 50 and the S&P 500 over the past four years, indicating that Indian markets are becoming less influenced by US market fluctuations.\n\nThis independence is apparent in how Indian markets now handle FPI outflows more effectively. A notable example occurred in October 2024, when despite FPI withdrawals of USD 11 billion, the Nifty 50 index dropped by only 6.2 per cent, sustained by robust support from domestic institutional and retail investors.\n\nThis contrasts significantly with March 2020, when FPI outflows of USD 8 billion led to a sharp 23 per cent market decline during the pandemic.\n\nHowever, whilst the Indian market's stability, bolstered by increased retail participation, shows promise, it remains important to consider the potential impact of a US market downturn, considering past patterns.\n\nAnalysis shows that Indian equity markets have historically been responsive to US market movements. The Nifty 50's correlation with the S&P 500 is significant, with data from 2000 to 2024 showing that during 22 occasions of the S&P 500 declining over 10 percent, the Nifty 50 decreased in all but one instance, with an average decline of 10.7 per cent. Conversely, in 51 instances of Nifty 50 corrections exceeding 10 per cent, the S&P 500 showed positive returns 13 times, averaging a -5.5 percent return.\n\nThis demonstrates an unbalanced relationship between these markets, with US market movements having a stronger influence on Indian equities than vice versa.\n\nAdditional analysis indicates that S&P 500 returns Granger-cause Nifty 50 returns, suggesting US market changes precede Indian market movements, particularly during market disruptions, whilst the opposite isn't true. This confirms Indian markets' susceptibility to US market trends, warranting vigilance during potential US market downturns.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

    "raw_text": "It is all about coming here and playing good brand of cricket. Stick to the basics. We have left that game in Rajkot. Hopefully we put up an entertaining show for this crowd. Little bit on the drier, put runs on the board and defend. Arshdeep comes in, Rinku comes in for Jurel and we have had some firepower - Shivam Dube comes in for Washington Sundar.\n\nIndia skipper Suryakumar Yadav at toss\n\nWe are gonna bowl first this evening. It feels like a great atmosphere already, the series is nicely set-up. Very happy with that performance, we have areas to improve but happy to get the win. Little bit unsure to be the honest with the dew, if it will come in or not. We have two changes - Mahmood for Wood, Bethell for Smith.\n\nEngland skipper Jos Buttler at toss\n\nThere is always a breeze which blows and it's a pretty strong one. Dimensions - 65m and 64m square boundaries and a hit down the ground is 75m. Pitch - it's 60% red soil and 40% black soil. The red soil basically means that it has a little bit of carry and bounce, so there's a bit more in this surface than the black soil. That'll suit England a little bit. When you have a look at it, it's slightly deceiving, you can see the cracks but essentially we've got a covering of grass but it's dead grass and rolled in. I don't think it's going to play a major role. But it is pretty dry, you can see some cracks emerging, that then will suit some of the pace-off bowlers with their spin. So I am going to sit on the fence a little bit here. There's a bit in it for the pace bowlers and there's a bit in it for the spinners. When you look at the average score here, it's not a high-scoring ground. The curator says that the dew might set in around 8;30 although in practice it sets in around 6:30.\n\nMurali Kartik and Nick Knight in Pitch Report",

    "title": "Delhi vs Railways, Ranji Trophy Live Score: Delhi lead Railways by 93 runs at stumps on Day 2",
    "authors": ["Times Of India"],
    "raw_text": "Virat Kohli's much-hyped return to Delhi squad turned out to be a damp squib as the former India captain was clean bowled for just 6 runs on the second day of the Ranji Trophy clash against Railways.\n\nKohli, whose comeback had put Delhi into a frenzy, walked out to bat to loud cheers after the dismissal of Yash Dhull.\n\nJharkhand captain Ishan Kishan could score just 7 runs in the second innings against Tamil Nadu, after his 8 runs in the first. Jharkhand, who made 185 in their first innings, restricted the opposition to 106/9 to take a 79-run lead. However, they were bundled out cheaply again, for 154, which set Tamil Nadu a target of 234 to win.\n\nBadoni (53*) and Mathur (28*) have taken Delhi to 168 for 4 at lunch on Day 2, trailing Railways by 73 runs. Kohli's much anticipated return to Ranji Trophy saw him scoring just 6 runs before he was clean-bowled by Sangwan.\n\nThe stands that were buzzing a little while ago at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, wear a deserted look since the dismissal of Virat Kohli for 6. Delhi 147 for 4, in response to Railways' first-innings total of 241.\n\nLed by a good show by their top order, Saurashtra put up a formidable 474 runs on the board in their first innings against Assam at Rajkot. The batting card by led by opener Desai's 130, while the other opener Chirag Jani made 80, Cheteshwar Pujara 99 and Sheldon Jackson 48. The other notable contribution came from Gajjar Samar in the middle order, with an unbeaten knock of 60. Rahul Singh and Mukhtar Hussain took three wickets each.\n\nThe run-fest at the Holkar Stadium in Indore continues as Madhya Pradesh reach 408 for 1 against Uttar Pradesh, led by their opener Harsh Gawali's double hundred. At the moment. Gawali is batting on 201 with his captain Shubham Sharma at the other end on 145.\n\nMany disappointed fans have started making their way out of the stands. It's been an anti-climax to the excitement thad had been building up over the last two days.\n\nSangwan sends Kohli's off-stump cartwheeling for just six runs, right after Kohli hit him straight back for a four. Stun silence in the crowd. Almost a walking shot by Kohli as he left a big gap between his bat and pad. The batting icon is dismissed for 6 runs. Delhi 86 for 3.\n\nThe first ball that Virat Kohli faced in Ranji Trophy after more than 12 years turns out to be a no-ball. But he is looking very compact and decisive in his defence in his short stay so far. Time for drinks.\n\nThe half-chances and close appelas for LBWs and possible edges by Railways' bowlers are being backed by loud cheers from the crowd that is getting impatient to watch Kohli bat, which will happen when the second Delhi wicket falls. Currently they are 70/1 in response to Railways's first-innings total of 241.\n\nDelhi vs Railways Live: As Kohli waits for his turn to bat, here's what he has achieved since his last match for Delhi in 2012\n\nPujara needed just five runs to reach the three-figure mark on day two against Assam in Rajkot, but he was dismissed one short of a century by Ghadigaonkar. Saurashtra 365/4\n\nReusming at the overnight total of 335 for 1 against Uttar Pradesh, MP opener Harsh Gawali needs 23 runs more to continue his double century, with captain Shubham Sharma at the other end batting on 100\n\nMumbai captain Ajinkya Rahane will look to get the 17 runs he needs to reach a hundred and carry on from there to get a big one for his team that is already in a commanding position, having reached 213 for 2 after bowling out Meghalaya for just 86 on Day 1.\n\nSaurashtra mainstay Pujara is just five runs away from completing yet another century as the hosts resume at a commanding 361 for 3 against Assam in Rajkot.\n\nVirat will come out to bat on the second day if and when Delhi loses another wicket, while Railways' Upendra Yadav, who was the top scorer for his team with his knock of 95, said that they have \"made plans\" for Kohli.\n\nVirat Kohli is trending for making his comeback in the Ranji Trophy after almost 13 years, but besides his name, chilli paneer was the other dominant keyword on social media on Thursday.\n\nDelhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) canteen owner Sanjay Jha spoke to TimesofIndia.com and shared the details.\n\nThe match in Delhi will resume at the scheduled start time of 9:30 am, and Timesofindia.com will be at the venue like yesterday to bring you all the action from outside and inside the stadium.\n\nThere are a host of other Indian stars on show in this round of the elite first-class tournament. Among them, Mumbai all-rounder had a historic day, which saw him becoming the fifth Mumbai bowler to take a hat-trick in the Ranji Trophy, while his senior teammate Ajinkya Rahane scored a half-century in the match against Meghalaya. Meanwhile, Saurashtra's Cheteshwar Pujara also notched up a half-century.\n\nAfter winning the toss and opting to bat, Delhi bowled out Railways for 41, led by Navdeep Saini's three wickets, and then reached 41 for 1 at stumps. Slated to bat at his customary No. 4 position, Kohli will walk in at the fall of next wicket.\n\nDelhi witnessed maddening scenes at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on the first day of the match, with a crowd in excess of 15,000 inside the stadium and many more trying to get in. If that was anything to go by, it's going to be even more frentic on day two with Delhi set to bat.\n\nHello and welcome back to Timesofindia.com's live coverage of the Ranji Trophy, which will once again see fans thronging the Arun Jaitley Stadium for Delhi's match against the Railways, with a chance to watch batting icon Virat Kohli very much in the offing. And we are here to bring you action from that game as well as from other matches being played simultaneously across the country.",

    "title": "Delhi Elections 2025 Live Updates: 7 AAP MLAs quit, party leader says 'were denied ticket over negative ratings'",
    "authors": ["Times Of India"],
    "raw_text": "After resigning as AAP MLA, Madan Lal said, \" Don't feel like working in this party, this is the biggest reason, we thought about it so many times, even though we did not get tickets, we stayed in the party for over 1 and half months but those people to whom the party gave tickets, their performance, party's performance, it feels like party made a mistake...party is moving away from its ideologies...\"\n\nUttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Friday claimed that several infrastructure projects including roads, expressways, and transit corridors have been strengthened here at a cost of Rs 68,000 crore under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Addressing an election rally in Moti Nagar vidhan sabha, Dhami said that party candidate Harish Khurana and his family have been serving Delhi for decades, with his father being one of the founders of BJP.\n\nDhami targeted Aam Aadmi Party supremo alleging, \"Kejriwal and his AAPda party do the opposite of what they say.\"\n\nThe hill state CM, while addressing another rally in Shalimar Bagh, also alleged that Kejriwal has become the \"brand ambassador\" of corruption in the country.\n\n\"Today our country is progressing rapidly under the leadership of PM Modi. Be it roads, health, train facilities, infrastructure or science and technology, our country is progressing in every area,\" Dhami said.\n\nAfter resigning as AAP MLA, Bhupinder Singh Joon said, \"There is no pressure on us, candidate list came on 9th December and today is 31st January, so amid this, we thought about this and accessed. The ideology with which AAP had come, it has moved away from it...there are 4-5 people in the high command who are totally corrupt and there are chargesheets registered against them in Liquor scam and Swati Maliwal case...\"\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann Friday said AAP does not have money and can only spread love, a day after an Election Commission team reached Kapurthala House, his official residence here, to conduct a search over allegation that money was being distributed from there in the poll-bound city. Amid a blame game between the Aam Aadmi Party and the EC, the flying squad returned empty-handed from Kapurthala House at Copernicus Road on Thursday, claiming the doors were locked and no searches could be conducted.\n\nCampaigning in the Kondli constituency in support of AAP candidate Kuldeep Kumar on Friday, Mann asked the EC what did they find from Kapurthala House during their search and asserted that the AAP wins elections through love, not money.\n\n\"We can only distribute love, we do not have money,\" he added.\n\nOn Thursday the Punjab chief minister slammed the poll panel saying its \"searches\" were an insult to all \"Punjabis\". In a post on X, he claimed, that the EC officials searched every nook and corner of Kapurthala House.\n\nAAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Friday expressed confidence that his party will once again secure over 60 out of 70 seats in the February 5 Delhi Assembly elections. Addressing a 'janasabha' in east Delhi's Laxmi Nagar constituency, Kejriwal claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had already conceded defeat.\n\n\"BJP has accepted their loss. If every vote goes to 'jhaadu' (broom, AAP's election symbol) against BJP's hooliganism, we will once again cross 60 seats,\" he said.\n\nAAP had won 62 out of 70 seats in the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections and an unprecedented 67 seats in 2015.\n\nKejriwal also warned voters that if the BJP came to power, it would discontinue AAP-led government's free welfare schemes, including free electricity, water, and bus rides for women.\n\nOn PM Modi's statements on AAP in his election rally, AAP national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar says, \"Whenever PM Modi speaks, he lies...He abused a government that presented Delhi model to the country...I don't think anyone believes what PM Modi says...He gave a similar 'jumla' of seaplane before Gujarat elections. Crores of Rupees were spent but it got busted. He said the same for 100 smart cities. But what happened to all that?...\"\n\nSeveral prominent members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have resigned from their positions as Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), citing dissatisfaction with the party's decision to not grant them tickets for the upcoming elections.\n\nThe resignations include Rohit Mehraulia, MLA from Trilokpuri, Madan Lal from Kasturba Nagar, Rajesh Rishi from Janakpuri, and Bhavna Gaur from Palam. Additionally, Bhupinder Singh Joon, the MLA from Bijwasan, and Pawan Kumar Sharma, the MLA from Adarsh Nagar, have also stepped down from their posts.\n\nThe AAP has not provided tickets to these six MLAs for the next election cycle, a move that has led to their departure from the party. Sources close to the resigned members suggest that the decision to exclude them from the list of candidates was a key factor in their decision to leave.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi Friday launched a sharp attack on the Aam Aadmi Party, accusing it of stalling Delhi's development while using the national capital's resources for its political gains.\n\nHe urged people to elect a \"double-engine government\" to ensure the city's progress.\n\nSpeaking at a public rally in Dwarka, Modi showcased the recently inaugurated Yashobhoomi convention centre, terming it a glimpse of the BJP's vision for a modern Delhi. \"The BJP wants to make Delhi modern and a glimpse of that can be seen in Dwarka after the Centre constructed the majestic Yashobhoomi here,\" he said.\n\nTaking a swipe at AAP, the prime minister alleged that the party has turned Delhi into a \"political ATM\" to fund its ambitions in other states. \"AAP-da (AAP disaster) has looted Delhi's money and is using it to expand its politics elsewhere. They are taking money out of Delhiites' pockets,\" he said, urging voters to free the city from its rule.\n\nModi accused AAP of engaging in constant fights instead of focusing on governance.\n\n\"Over the past years, they have only been fighting - with Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and with the Centre. If such people continue to rule Delhi, the city will keep lagging behind,\" he warned.\n\nPM Modi said, \"Delhi needs a government of coordination, not one of conflict, so that every major problem of Delhi can be solved together. Together we have to free Delhi from the loot and lies of AAP-da...AAP-da people have made Delhi an ATM to shine their politics. AAP-da people have squeezed out Delhi's money and looted it. By committing scams in Delhi, these AAP leaders use black money to shine in politics in other states of the country. I assure you that as soon as we form the government in Delhi, we will take strict action against AAP-da’s corruption. Those who have looted Delhi will be held accountable and made to return what they took.\"\n\nDuring the address, PM Modi said, \"I assure you that as soon as we form the government in Delhi, we will take strict action against AAPda’s corruption. Those who have looted Delhi will be held accountable and made to return what they took.\"\n\n\"In the very first session of the Assembly, the CAG report will be presented. This report will reveal AAPda’s scams, which is why they are trying to hide it,\" he added.\n\nPM Modi said, \"Delhi needs a double engine government of the Central and State governments. You saw Congress in power for many years, and then AAP took over Delhi. You have given me the opportunity to serve the country again and again, and now give me a chance to serve Delhi also by forming a double-engine government. A glimpse of the extent to which the BJP wants to make Delhi modern can be seen here in Dwarka. The central government constructed a magnificent Yashobhoomi here. Because of Yashobhoomi, thousands of youth from Dwarka and Delhi have got employment and the business of the people has grown here. In the coming time, this entire area will be a kind of smart city\"\n\nVoters in the national capital, during the February 5 Assembly elections, will be able to check the length of the queue outside each polling station on an app, the Chief Electoral Office, Delhi, said on Friday.\n\n\"For the first time in the country, an artificial intelligence-based Queue Management System will allow voters to monitor real-time crowd levels at polling centres on election day,\" said Delhi CEO R. Alice Vaz.\n\nOften, voters leave without casting their ballots due to long queues. However, with this app, they can access live crowd updates, helping them to plan their visit, she said.\n\nThe app's primary benefit is that it saves voters time by reducing the need to wait in long queues, thus, increasing the turnout of Delhities to vote.\n\nThe app 'Delhi Election - 2025 QMS' is available in the Google Play Store, she said.\n\nApart from the new queue management system, the Delhi election office has also introduced a colour-code scheme for easy booth identification. The electoral slips distributed to voters bear a circular, coloured sticker. Each voter's polling booth shall also bear the same colour.\n\n\"All District Election Officers will set up polling stations following a colour code. The Specific colour code assigned to a particular polling station will be parted in the Voter Information Slip which is being distributed to voters. This initiative aims to reduce confusion, minimise delays, and ensure a smoother voting process on Election Day,\" said an official.\n\nWith less than a week left for Delhi assembly polls, Congress candidate from the New Delhi constituency Sandeep Dikshit on Thursday dared Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal for an open debate.\n\nThe Congress leader said if Kejriwal does not have time, then he is ready to set up a stage outside the AAP leader's residence for the debate.\n\n\"I have challenged Kejriwal to an open debate; if Kejriwal does not have time, then I am ready to set up a stage outside Kejriwal's residence,\" Dikshit told ANI.\n\n\"I (Sandeep Dixit) am ready for a debate outside Jantar Mantar, Kejriwal house or wherever the Aam Aadmi Party is convenient,\" he added.\n\nTaking a swipe at the recent 'poisonous water' controversy, he said that the Election Commission should allow Delhi Police to question Kejriwal on the issue.\n\nKejriwal had alleged that the Haryana government had \"poisoned\" the water supplied to Delhi, with the intention of causing harm to its residents. Following this, Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini visited the banks of the Yamuna River in Delhi's Palla village on Wednesday, where he took a sip of water to counter accusations made by former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nHe then attacked AAP for the Punjab Police row, alleging AAP of 'misusing' Punjab's Police everywhere.\n\n\" Kejriwal ji, you talked about (cleaning/drinking) the water of Yamuna five years ago. Today, someone told me, that he is holding a press conference with the bottles of the water of the Yamuna,\" he said, referring to Arvind Kejriwal.\n\n\"It is all hollowness. He speaks one lie after another. The way Modi ji speaks lies, Kejriwal ji also does it. There is no difference (between them). Probably, there is only one thing. Probably, Kejriwal ji is more clever than Modiji,\" he added.\n\n\"I believe that in the last 10 years, Arvind Kejriwal ji should have done some work, especially in cleaning the Yamuna. Recently, in a podcast, he himself admitted that if he had cleaned the river, he wouldn’t have gotten votes. Is it appropriate for a CM, who has been in office for so long, to make such statements? The truth is that today, the Yamuna has turned into a drain,\" she said.\n\n\"...He (Arvind Kejriwal) said that I have done so much work; I have just said that whatever you say, say it with a record. Today, at 3 pm, it will be clear that either Congress or AAP is speaking the truth... Both BJP and AAP are distributing cash to get votes; I want to ask them if they are in politics or the market?\" the Congress leader said.\n\n\"... Sometimes, I fail to understand what Arvind Kejriwal) studied at IIT. Being an engineer, he is saying such absurd things that a student of class 5 or 6 would not say. What had he done? I think he passed his exams by cheating... I'll suggest he should go through his engineering books--he will come to know how much he lies,\" added Dikshit.\n\n\"It seems that Arvind Kejriwal is seeing defeat in the upcoming elections and that is why he is resorting to such a shameful lie... What Arvind Kejriwal is saying is untrue. The Haryana government has not released any kind of poisonous substance into the Yamuna river... I would request Arvind Kejriwal not to sacrifice the people of Delhi for his political interests,\" she said.\n\n\"Many congratulations to the people of Delhi. Our struggle bore fruit. The poisonous water that was being sent to Delhi has now stopped. The amount of ammonia in the water coming to Delhi has decreased from 7 ppm to 2 ppm. If we had not raised our voice and struggled, half the population of Delhi would not have been getting water today. We saved Delhi from a huge water crisis. The Election Commission has issued a notice and threatened me. My reply to the Election Commission,\" he wrote in his X post.\n\n\"Today, we are launching a new campaign across Delhi. Our workers will go door-to-door and have people fill out the ‘Bachat Patra.’ We will sit with the families and calculate how much they benefit from AAP’s schemes,\" he said.\n\n\"AAP's savings certificate - Direct savings of Rs 25,000 every month. If Aam Aadmi Party comes to power, every family in Delhi will have this saving. If BJP comes to power, all this will stop,\" Kejriwal added.\n\n\"Arvind Kejriwal continuously lies. When proven so - he apologises. He put false allegations on the esteemed institutions of the country and disrespecting them has become the habit of Arvind Kejriwal... He has disturbed the environment of Delhi - he is going to face a massive defeat and hence he is trying to dent the image of the Election Commission. I want him to save some tears to cry over EVM on February 8..,\" he said.\n\n\"Arvind Kejriwal is once again on his marathon of speaking lies. He is making new promises. The person who came with the motive to end corruption did huge scams,\" he said.\n\n\"Once a person died and went to heaven, where Chitragupta started deliberating on his 'sin' and 'virtue'. Meanwhile, the man heard a 'ping' sound and asked Chitragupta about it. Replying to the query, Chitragupta said, 'Whenever a politician speaks lies during the Delhi election campaign, this sound is heard. After 10 minutes, as the sound became consistent, the man asked, 'What happened?' Chitragupta replied, 'Arvind Kejriwal's speech has started',\" he added.\n\nIn response to the notice issued to him by ECI, Arvind Kejriwal wrote a reply which reads, “If no action is taken against the Haryana government and the BJP leaders involved in corrupt practices it will be amply clear to everyone that the CEC keeps the interest of the ruling party over public interest. Unfortunately, I can't be expected to be silent on this and tow this line out of fear or expectations of favour. My only concern is the health and safety of the people of Delhi and I will fight for the protection of our democratic principles. Whatever illegal punishment you may wish to impose on me under the instruction of the BJP is a small price to pay for it, and I welcome it with open arms.”\n\nAAP chief Arvind Kejriwal visited the Election Commission's office on Friday to respond to a notice over his \"poison mixed in Yamuna water\" remark. He was accompanied by Delhi chief minister Atishi and Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann. Before heading to the EC, Kejriwal claimed the second notice indicated the poll body had already decided on their course of action. He accused the EC of targeting the AAP for speaking out and suggested it was a political conspiracy aimed at defaming the party ahead of Delhi Assembly elections by forcing an artificial water crisis with high ammonia levels.\n\nKejriwal praised Delhi residents, stating the ammonia levels in the Yamuna had dropped from 7 ppm to 2.1 ppm, thanks to their collective efforts. The Election Commission had earlier served him two notices over his claim that the BJP government was attempting a \"genocide\" by contaminating the city's water supply.\n\nYamuna Water Row | AAP National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal says, \"CM Atishi called Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini to complain about the rising ammonia levels in water. She asked to either reduce the ammonia levels or release extra water to dilute the ammonia levels. He agreed to the demands but did not take action. This happened thrice and after that, he stopped taking Atishi's calls... Even Bhagwant Mann tried talking to Haryana CM to which he was given assurances but in vain... One by one, Delhi's water treatment plants started shutting down. Delhi's Chief Secretary also talked to Haryana Chief Secretary in this matter urging him to take action. Haryana's Chief Secretary said something very shocking. He said this decision has been taken at the top level and he suggested that Delhi CM talk to Haryana CM. This is when we realised this is a political conspiracy to influence elections... When the Punjab irrigation secretary talked to his counterpart in Haryana, it was confirmed that it was a political conspiracy... What happened after 15 January is shocking. Ammonia levels reached 3.2 ppm and gradually started increasing and reached 7 ppm by 26 January... This is when CM Atishi organised a press conference and informed everyone about it...They thought that they would be able to blame AAP by creating water scarcity in Delhi. Now the ppm has reduced to 2.1 which means that it was well in their control... Our agitation worked...\"\n\nAam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor says, \"I want to thank people of Delhi that the struggle of AAP government and 2-2.5 crore people have shown result. The Haryana government was sending ammonia-laden water to Delhi... on January 26-27 the level was 7 PPM ammonia, today that ammonia level come down to 2.1. This clearly shows that the BJP-led Haryana government wanted to create trouble in Delhi.\"\n\n\"The courts have dismissed all fake allegations made against Kejriwal...BJP has 20 states with it but why is there no uninterrupted 24-hour power supply in these states? They have done a scam with the lives of people. In Mahakumbh, we saw that all facilities were for VIPs, not the common people...This is the time the people of Delhi will give such a current that it will hit BJP,\" she said.\n\n\"...He (Arvind Kejriwal) said that I have done so much work; I have just said that whatever you say, say it with record. Today, at 3 pm it will be clear that either Congress or AAP is speaking the truth... Both BJP and AAP are distributing cash to get votes, I want to ask them if they are in politics or the market?...\" he questioned.\n\n\"... Sometimes, I fail to understand what did he (Arvind Kejriwal) study at IIT. Being an engineer he is saying such absurd things that a student of class 5 or 6 would not say. What had he done? I think he passed his exams by cheating... I'll suggest him to go through his engineering books - he will come to know how much he lies,\" he added.\n\n\"Election Commission is an independent body and action will be taken wherever a complaint will be received. Bhagwant Mann is on a constitutional post, he should cooperate when the team comes for a search. He should also stay away from counter-allegations. If you think BJP has done something then you can complain to the EC, but you should cooperate when the team comes for a search,\" said Sarma.\n\nArvind Kejriwal, leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), has accused Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar of engaging in political activities by issuing a notice over his allegations that the Haryana government is contaminating the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. Kejriwal suggested that Kumar's actions are motivated by a desire for a post-retirement position and challenged him to drink Yamuna water publicly. He also criticized the Election Commission for overlooking alleged electoral malpractices and expressed concerns about a potential arrest in the near future.",

    "raw_text": "\"The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers' savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions.\n\nThe Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust.\n\nA Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes:\n\nSimplification of income tax slabs and rates:\n\n* Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs\n\n* The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps.\n\n* Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%.\n\n* The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs.\n\nInclusion of popular deductions under the NTR:\n\n* Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc.\n\n* Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses.\n\n* Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc.\n\n* 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR.\n\nThese proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient,” says Deepashree Shetty, Partner, Global Employer Services, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India.\n\nFriends,\n\nToday, at the beginning of the budget session, I bow to Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. And on such occasions, for centuries, we have been remembering the virtues of Goddess Lakshmi:\n\nसिद्धिबुद्धिप्रदे देवि भुक्तिमुक्तिप्रदायिनि। मंत्रपूते सदा देवि महालक्ष्मि नमोस्तुते।\n\nMaa Lakshmi gives us success and wisdom, prosperity and well-being. I pray to Maa Lakshmi that every poor and middle class community of the country should be blessed with the special blessings of Maa Lakshmi.\n\nFriends,\n\nOur Republic has completed 75 years, and this is a matter of great pride for every citizen of the country, and this strength of India also creates a special place for itself in the democratic world.\n\nFriends,\n\nThe people of the country have given me this responsibility for the third time, and this is the first full budget of this third term, and I can confidently say that in 2047 when the country will celebrate 100 years of independence, the resolution of a developed India that the country has taken, this budget session, this budget will create a new confidence, will give a new energy, that when the country celebrates 100 years of independence, it will be developed. 140 crore countrymen will fulfill this resolution with their collective efforts. In the third term, we are moving ahead in mission mode towards all-round development of the country, whether it is geographically, socially or in the context of different economic levels. We are moving ahead in mission mode with the resolution of all-round development. Innovation, inclusion and investment have constantly been the basis of the roadmap of our economic activity.\n\nAs always, this session will have many historic days. Tomorrow there will be discussions in the House and after a lot of deliberation, laws will be made that will increase the strength of the nation. Especially, to re-establish the pride of Nari Shakti, to ensure that every woman gets a respectable life without any discrimination of caste and creed and gets equal rights, many important decisions will be taken in this session in that direction. Reform, Perform and Transform. When we have to achieve a fast pace of development, the maximum emphasis is on reform. The state and central governments have to perform together and we can see transformation with public participation.\n\nOurs is a young country, a youthful power and the youth who are 20-25 years old today, when they turn 45-50 years old, they will be the biggest beneficiaries of a developed India. They will be at that stage of their life, they will be sitting in that position in the policy making system, that they will proudly move forward with a developed India in the century that will begin after independence. And hence this effort to fulfill the resolution of a developed India, this immense hard work, is going to be a great gift for our teenagers, our young generation today.\n\nThose who had joined the freedom struggle in 1930, 1942, the young generation of the entire country was spent in the freedom struggle, and its fruits were reaped by the generation that came after 25 years. The youth who were in that war got those benefits. Those 25 years before independence became an opportunity to celebrate independence. Similarly, these 25 years are the intention of the countrymen to achieve a prosperous and developed India through their resolve and reach the pinnacle through their achievements. And therefore, in this budget session, all the MPs will contribute towards strengthening developed India. Especially, it is a golden opportunity for the young MPs because the more awareness and participation they will have in the House today, the more fruits of developed India they will see right in front of their eyes. And therefore, it is a priceless opportunity for the young MPs.\n\nFriends,\n\nI hope that we will live up to the hopes and aspirations of the country in this Budget session.\n\nFriends,\n\nToday you must have noticed one thing, people in the media should definitely notice it. Perhaps since 2014, this is the first session of Parliament in which there has been no foreign spark a day or two before the session, there has been no attempt to ignite a fire from abroad. I have been observing for 10 years, since 2014, that before every session people used to sit ready to create mischief, and here there is no dearth of people who fan it. This is the first session I am seeing after the last 10 years in which there was no spark from any foreign corner.\n\nThank you very much, friends.",

He attempted to rob Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan's home. Shariful entered India through West Bengal, used fake documents to gain employment, and targeted affluent areas for burglary. His apprehension highlights the ongoing issue of illegal immigration and fake documentation networks.\n\nNavi Mumbai airport will begin operations in late May and is projected to become the primary airport in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region by the early 2030s.

An FIR has been filed for further investigation.\n\nVillagers from Thamnapokpi, Sanasabi, and Yaingangpokpi are protesting against the potential withdrawal of BSF and CRPF forces from Uyok Hills, fearing exposure to further militant attacks. Forces deployed after clashes involved militants attacking nearby villages. The protest stems from concerns about security and follows ethnic clashes in Manipur between the Kuki and Meitei communities.\n\nSecurity forces in Manipur's Churachandpur district seized six rockets, a launcher, and other munitions during search operations.

From the regular hustle-bustle of the fast-paced life of the metropolis to the gastronomical delights in Old Delhi. From latest political developments to entertainment-related events or even traffic jams. We cover it all in detail and you can check it all in just one click. Delhi, the capital of India, is also considered the heart of the nation. The massive metropolitan city lies in a triangle formed by the river Yamuna in the east and spurs from the Aravali range in the west and south. The city, a largest and busiest commercial hub in northern India, is also the largest centre of small industries. The IT sector, handloom, fashion, textile and electronic industry contribute a lot to Delhi's economy. The capital has a strong historical background too. It was ruled by some of the most powerful emperors. And thus, it radiates with its syncretic culture. The history of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata. It was known as Indraprastha, where Pandavas used to live. In due course, eight more cities came alive adjacent to Indraprastha - Lal Kot, Siri, Dinpanah, Quila Rai Pithora, Ferozabad, Jahanpanah, Tughlakabad and Shahjahanabad. The city is divided into two parts - Old Delhi and New Delhi. New Delhi, also called Lutyens' Delhi, bears a striking contrast to Old Delhi with respect to architecture, building materials and layout. However, modern Delhi itself dates back to over a century when the British shifted their capital from Calcutta to Delhi.",

Is there scope for more upside in the already stretched valuation?\n\nThe bidding war, the 100% rally, and the hidden upside: Is Religare still a buy?Subscriber Only\n\nCare Health Insurance, India’s second-largest standalone health insurer and Religare’s most valuable asset, has been growing rapidly. Its impending IPO could be a game-changer for Religare’s shareholders. Yet, the question remains: Can Religare sustain its 100% return streak, or is the stock running out of steam?\n\nCan Zomato bounce back after a 30% stock plunge?Subscriber Only\n\nZomato’s stock has tumbled 30% from its peak, slashing its one-year return to 60%. This sudden crash has reignited questions about the company’s ability to sustain its ambitious growth narrative. Is this a short-term correction for a high-growth company or a sign of cracks in its broader strategy?\n\nValue vs convenience: Can DMart hold its ground against the quick commerce surge?Subscriber Only\n\nThe rise of quick commerce is reshaping consumer behaviour, with many willing to pay for services like home delivery. DMart is facing challenges brought on by this shift. Will its focus on value endure the quick commerce wave, or is it on a secular decline? As competition rises, so do investor questions.\n\nZomato triggers another war: Big brokerages take big opposing viewsSubscriber Only\n\nSeveral analysts cut their target price on Zomato amidst rising competition. However, one reputed brokerage remains bullish on its leadership position. The company is at the crossroads of growth and margins.\n\nBattle Royale in the paints industry: Is Asian Paints losing its sheen?Subscriber Only\n\nAsian Paints, once a Baap (Buy At Any Price) darling, faces stiff competition and valuation pressures.

The big question now is: how much bigger can this model grow?\n\nWockhardt’s ‘miracle drug’ Zaynich: Can it revive the antibiotics market and the company’s fortunes?Subscriber Only\n\nWockhardt’s experimental drug, Zaynich, has shown impressive results, achieving a 100% cure rate in clinical trials for drug-resistant infections. The drug’s success has caused Wockhardt’s stock to surge by nearly 191% in the past year. The company now faces its biggest challenge: can it turn this scientific breakthrough into a financial one?\n\nIs now the time to invest in India’s AI stocks?Subscriber Only\n\nAI has made waves across the globe, including in India.

While the iconic pizza chain remains its backbone, the company is actively cooking up new opportunities that could fuel its next wave of growth.

    "authors": ["Sports Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Despite putting on a decent bowling performance going in with only two seam options, India’s vaunted batting order came under the scanner against a strong English pace attack in Rajkot. The defeat has exposed certain chinks in the floating batting order as well as India’s overreliance on spin-bowling all-rounders. At Pune, India could reinforce their attack with the return of Arshdeep Singh while Washington Sundar could make way for seam-bowling all-rounder Ramandeep Singh.\n\nPredicted XIs\n\nIndia predicted XI for 4th T20I: Sanju Samson (wk), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav (c), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ramandeep Singh, Washington Sundar/Dhruv Jurel, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammad Shami, Varun Chakaravarthy.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nStar player to watch for: Varun CV is unplayable at the moment. Despite ending on the losing side last game, the wily spinner was handed the player of the match award for his second five-wicket haul in T20Is. England have failed to come up with a plan to neutralise Chakaravarthy and his bag of tricks.\n\nEngland predicted XI: Ben Duckett, Phil Salt (wk), Jos Buttler (c), Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Jamie Smith, Jamie Overton, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood.\n\nCaptain Jos Buttler will once again be the glue that will hold the England batting order together and the seasoned IPL star will have a say on a potentially pacy deck at the Gahunje venue.\n\nIndia vs England squads\n\nIndia: Suryakumar Yadav (c), Axar Patel (vc), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Rinku Singh, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammad Shami, Varun Chakaravarthy, Ravi Bishnoi, Washington Sundar and Dhruv Jurel (wk).\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nEngland: Jos Buttler (c), Harry Brook (vc), Phil Salt (wk), Jacob Bethell, Liam Livingstone, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Ben Duckett, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, and Mark Wood.\n\nIndia vs England head-to-head records in T20Is\n\nMatches played: 27, India won: 15, England won: 12\n\nIndia vs England 4th T20I Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at the MCA Stadium has exhibited a change in nature across the four T20Is it has hosted since 2012. While the earlier games have tilted heavily in faovur of slower bowlers, pacers have enjoyed owling at the ground over the last two outings here. India have had a mixed record at the ground, winning two and losing two matches over the years.\n\nIndia vs England Weather Report\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, the weather in Pune on January 31 is expected to remain clear, with no chance of rain. The maximum temperature will hover around 34 degrees Celsius, while the minimum will drop to 10 degrees.\n\nStory continues below this ad",

    "title": "A Goa scam unravels: Portuguese-era land papers forged, properties ‘sold’ by the dead",
    "authors": ["Pavneet Singh Chadha"],
    "raw_text": "Significantly, the Commission suggested that such an operation was “not possible without the connivance of the Archives (department) staff”, but observed that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the cases is yet to investigate this aspect.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAfter a series of complaints came to light, the Goa government formed an SIT on June 15, 2022, to investigate cases of illegal land transfer and land grabbing using forged documents. The SIT probed 44 FIRs involving more than 100 properties — nearly 1.5 lakh sq metre of land — and made 56 arrests, including a record attendant from the Archives Department. Five chargesheets have been filed so far.\n\nThe state government appointed a Commission of Inquiry headed by former Bombay High Court judge Justice V K Jadhav (Retd) on September 9, 2022. The commission submitted its report to the government on November 1, 2023, and the Cabinet accepted it in January this year.\n\nThe 622-page report has damning observations on how the scam unfolded. Take, for instance:\n\n* One of the deeds, dated December 4, 1951, indicates how the family of one Augustus Monteiro was targeted. The deed shows his wife, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law as joint owners of properties that they sold to one Antonio Francisca Pereira. Except that Monteiro’s mother-in-law, Esperenca Oliveira, was 12 years old in 1951, while the others hadn’t even been born.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n* Another property measuring 2942.5 square metres is in Badem. Despite the property being in the family for decades, they discovered one day that it had been “sold” via a sale deed dated June 25, 1996. The deed says that two women in the family tree — Maria Anton D’ Souza and Maria Carvalho — were “married” to each other and sold the property to one Diago Roberto Rodrigues. Except, Maria Joaqueina Carvalho died in 1991.\n\n* In another case, records state that the owners of a property in Badem “executed” a deed of sale in 1951 in favour of the accused’s ancestor. Here, too, one of the sellers was dead, and the other wasn’t an owner at the time.\n\nIn fact, Badem in Goa’s Assagao emerged as a village that was repeatedly targeted. Around February 2022, residents began to notice that revenue records of several properties on the Goa government’s website reflected the names of different owners.\n\nThe change was due to recent mutation proceedings. On enquiring, villagers found that around 25 properties in the village, which has just 45 houses, reflected the names of a similar set of people on the Directorate of Settlement and Land Records website based on “forged” sale deeds.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIt was found that pages had allegedly been inserted into the archives department records, and an attempt had been made to bind them to the original book with a loose string. The authorities were alerted, and a probe began.\n\nThe report says that one of the prime accused told the SIT that he and his accomplices prepared fraudulent documents of 93 properties and that 15 had already been sold to different buyers. He disclosed that the mutation of 35 properties has been carried out by the office of Mamlatdar, and the documentation of the rest is underway. The report said, “It appears… most of the properties (47) are from Assagao village… and rest of the properties are from Calangute, Parra, Anjuna and Pilerne village.”\n\nHow they did it\n\nAccording to the Commission’s report, the accused would first identify vacant, unattended, dilapidated ancestral properties or properties occupied by owners with common Goan names such as Fernandes, Rodrigues, and D’Souza.\n\nThe accused would obtain ownership and title information of the properties from government offices and other sources.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe accused would then prepare fake and forged sale deeds, written in Portuguese-era style calligraphy, falsely shown to be executed by the owners in favour of blood relatives or ancestors of the accused.\n\nSubsequently, the accused, allegedly in connivance with the staff of the Directorate of Archives and Archaeology, inserted the forged sale deeds into their records, the report noted.\n\nThe accused then obtained certified copies of the fake sale deeds from the office of the Directorate of Archives and Archaeology and relied on the same as an authentic document.\n\nThe report noted, “It is their strategy in almost all crimes to execute the succession deed. It is shown that upon the demise of the purchaser of the said notarised deed of sale of Portuguese era, on the strength of the said deed of succession, the principal accused become the absolute owners of the property… Thereafter, they get the mutation certified at the earliest and execute the first nominal deed of sale without consideration to legalise the… acquisition of title. It is further their strategy to find out the innocent buyers and sell them the said property for a huge consideration and earn crores illegally out of it.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe commission called for a scientific investigation “to find out the age of the ink, paper, etc of the said notarised deed of sale, allegedly prepared during the Portuguese era”.\n\nArchives dept under scanner\n\nThe report pointed out that government records had been tampered with in a “systematic and organised” manner, indicating a conspiracy.\n\n“So far as the issue of insertion of false and forged deed of sale in the record of Archives department is concerned, the same is not possible without the connivance of the Archives staff. They are yet to be identified and investigation is going on in that regard. Even the Archives department has initiated a departmental inquiry to fix responsibility. Suffice to say that some staff members of the Archives department are part of the conspiracy hatched by the accused persons and helped them in commission of crime,” it noted.\n\n“In most of the crimes, similar modus operandi applied in certain group of FIRs, which is prima-facie indicative of the involvement of the personnel from The Department of Archives and Archaeology, personnel from the office of Mamlatdar, and personnel from the office of Civil Registrar cum Sub registrar and Notary ex-officio. However, the SIT has not yet commenced investigation pertaining to the activities that have arisen from the aforesaid departments in connection with the crimes,” it noted.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhile stressing that it is only “a facts-finding body” and has “no adjudicatory functions”, the commission observed that some persons played a key role in the commission of crime but “cleverly remained behind the curtain and used others as their pawn”.\n\nThe Department of Archives is the custodian of archival records from 1530. Its record holdings include over 3.2 lakh bound volumes, files and loose manuscripts, containing approximately three crore folios in repositories with historical, administrative and judicial importance. The Directorate of Archives and Archaeology was bifurcated into the Directorate of Archives and the Directorate of Archaeology a few years ago.\n\nRohit Kadam, Director of the Department of Archives, declined to comment on the commission’s observations.\n\nRahul Gupta, Superintendent of Police, Crime, said, “We are thoroughly investigating all the cases with financial and documentary linkages. More chargesheets are in the pipeline and will be filed soon.”",

    "title": "30% jump in gold loan NPAs in April-June on slowing economy, debts",
    "authors": ["George Mathew"],
    "raw_text": "In a reply to the Right to Information (RTI) request filed by The Indian Express, the RBI said commercial banks have reported a sharp 62 per cent increase in gold loan NPAs to Rs 2,445 crore by June 2024 from Rs 1,513 crore in March 2024. In the case of NBFCs, the increase is smaller at 24% to Rs 4,251 crore in June 2024 from Rs 3,636 crore in March 2024.\n\nThe surge in gold loan defaults is attributed to the rising indebtedness as a slowing economy has affected income levels, making it difficult for borrowers to repay.\n\nIn the first seven months of the current financial year, banks have reported a steep 50.4 per cent rise in gold loan, driven by the sustained rally in gold prices and certain deficiencies in the loans segment flagged by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\nWhen gold prices went up, people pledged their gold to meet household expenses, school and education fees, and hospital charges. They defaulted on the loans as they found the loan amount is greater than the purchase price and were oblivious of the fact that their credit score will come down after the default.\n\nAs customers rush to pledge gold to take advantage of high prices, gold loan outstanding of banks have jumped to Rs 1,54,282 crore as of October 2024, up from Rs 1,02,562 crore in March 2024. The gold loan book of banks and NBFCs together is estimated to have crossed the Rs 3 lakh crore mark.\n\nThe rise in gold loan NPAs has happened at a time when banks managed to bring down overall gross NPAs from Rs 6.97 lakh crore (5.89 per cent of advances) in March 2022 to Rs 4.56 lakh crore (2.79 per cent) by March 2024.\n\nThe RBI has taken note of the irregular practices in the gold loan sector and has directed lenders to review their policies and practices. The central bank has also identified weaknesses in monitoring loan-to-value ratios, incorrect application of risk weights, and lack of transparency during auctions of gold ornaments and jewellery.\n\nThe growing concern of gold loan defaults highlights the need for lenders to strengthen their credit assessment and verification processes, enhance financial literacy programs for borrowers, and implement more flexible repayment options.\n\nAccording to Shaji Varghese, CEO of Muthoot Fincorp, gold loan has been growing steadily since the past few quarters owing to its own strong features including zero prepayment charges unlike personal loans, daily repayment & interest only on outstanding amount, flexibility in repayment, including bullet payment options and many more. “Today it is a widely accepted and a popular choice among customers especially for short-term requirements and acts as a vital financial inclusion tool,” he said.\n\nOverall, organised gold loans expanded at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25 per cent over the period FY2020-FY2024, driven by banks, which expanded these loans at a higher CAGR of 26 per cent, while the NBFCs expanded theirs at 18 per cent during the same period. The growth in the case of banks was driven by agriculture loans backed by gold jewellery, which grew at a CAGR of 26 per cent during FY2020-24, while their retail gold loans grew by 32 per cent on a lower base. Consequently, the share of the NBFCs reduced during this period, which were largely focussed on retail gold loans for consumption or business purposes, rating firm ICRA said.",

    "title": "Union Education Budget 2025 Live: What is expected for the education sector?",
    "authors": ["Education Desk"],
    "raw_text": "The government should allocate a significant budget for improving infrastructure and learning practices to close the current gaps in the educational sector. The government's measures need to encourage students to enroll in higher education by lowering loan interest rates and allowing them longer due dates to relieve financial stress from students and families. Also, there is a need to add AI as a necessary learning model or subject in every college since industry has shifted dramatically in the last few years making AI a necessity in mostly all sectors. This will help India to become a global knowledge hub in a few years. At last, the budget allocation must be more aligned towards student loans and funding the fee for students for their skill development. The grants for National Education Policy (NEP) must focus on the implementation of multidisciplinary institutions with flexibility. Also, the government must allocate some more funds to research and development (R&D), encouraging partnerships between businesses and universities. To provide creative solutions to the education sector, public-private partnerships (PPPs) ought to be promoted. Working together with commercial organizations can make it easier to share technology, resources, and knowledge, improving the nation's overall educational quality.\n\n- Dr Devesh Kumar Singh, Chairman of Noida International University\n\nThe educational industry should prioritize international relationships with worldwide universities for a variety of programs. More scholarship measures, including decreased interest rates on school loans and STEM course subsidies, must be implemented. Skill development projects might focus on globally recognized vocational qualifications, and the government can provide assistance to returnees in finding jobs. Streamlined visa and application support could be implemented through government-backed platforms, streamlining processes and facilitating post-study employment options.\n\nInvestments in digital learning platforms and research funding could help Indian students gain access to worldwide courses while also encouraging innovation. Regional education hubs with top-tier infrastructure may entice international students and faculty. Centralized databases for tracking educational trends, as well as specialized grievance channels for Indian students studying abroad, could be developed. These policies seek to increase access, affordability, and opportunities for Indian students while presenting India as a global education leader.\n\n- Jyotee Naair, Founder of CareerVversity\n\nA significant increase in education funding is essential to bridge infrastructure gaps and promote skill development. More scholarships, streamlined remittance procedures, and lower GST on education loans will help families and give more students access to international study-abroad opportunities. The rising costs of international education demand proactive measures. Introducing tax benefits on education loans and subsidizing overseas education counseling services could be transformative. These steps would not only make studying abroad more accessible but also strengthen India’s soft power by fostering a globally competitive workforce. Digital transformation is another priority. Expanding digital infrastructure and subsidizing edtech platforms can ensure affordable and inclusive hybrid learning models, which are vital to preparing students for a globalized world. Studying abroad has immense potential to contribute to India’s socio-economic growth.\n\n- Ritika Gupta, CEO, Aaera Consultants\n\nThe NEP 2020 aims for a 100 per cent Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2030. The government has been striving to achieve the objectives of NEP 2020 through a range of programmes and schemes, including the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (along with its sub-schemes such as NISHTHA, Vidya Pravesh, District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs), Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV), etc.), DIKSHA17, STARS18, PARAKH19, PM SHRI20, ULLAS21, and PM POSHAN22, among others, according to the Economic Survey 2023-24.\n\nThe previous budget had put adequate focus on enhancing higher education and skill development in India. The Skill India for instance was reported to have already trained more than 1.4 crore youth while upskilling and reskilling over 54 lakh others. The budget also mentioned about setting up new higher educational institutions, including IITs, IIITs, IIMs, AIIMS etc. We expect the coming budget to lay further emphasis on upgrading skill education across existing universities and institutions. A dedicated budget allocation to facilitate increased industry-academia partnership is the need of the hour. While it will encourage more institutions to integrate action & experiential learning in their education delivery model, it will enable the creation of valuable industry-ready workforce, which would be well acquainted with the requirements and challenges of respective industries by the time the curriculum is completed.Education is a fundamental pillar of nation building and thus, we expect the Union Budget to announce the highest ever allocation for the education sector, especially in the wake of India’s young population.\n\n- Prof Supriya Pattanayak, Vice Chancellor, Centurion University, Odisha\n\nThe EdTech segment has been a crucial enabler in bridging the skill gap and enabling employment creation, as reflected in initiatives contained in the budget for last year. The push toward digital infrastructure development along with the introduction of technology in education was a foundational driver. For the 2025 budget, we have optimism that more reforms for GST will be in place and possibly reduce the steep 18% slab on online education services, making quality education achievable for all. Increased skilling program allocation under the Digital India initiative and incentives for EdTech companies driving innovation will be critical. Policies promoting collaboration between EdTech players and traditional educational institutions can also help scale the impact of digital education in India. A focused investment in last-mile connectivity and affordability this year will determine how effectively technology transforms learning outcomes across the nation.\n\n- Beas Dev Ralhan, CEO, Next Education, SaaS-based EdTech company in India serving more than 18000 schools and 12 million students\n\nWe hope the upcoming budget prioritises strategic measures such as GST rationalisation for EdTech services and increased funding for skilling programs under the Digital India initiative. These initiatives will enhance the accessibility of online education, empowering young learners with essential life skills to thrive in a globalised, skills-driven world. Furthermore, we anticipate tax incentives and policy support to foster innovation in the EdTech sector, ensuring that platforms like ours can play a pivotal role in shaping India’s future-ready workforce.\n\n- Kunal Malik, co-founder of PlanetSpark, a K12 skilling EdTech company dedicated to transforming communication skills for young learners\n\nThe Union Budget should address the challenges of educational loans to make education more accessible and affordable for students, especially those from weaker economic backgrounds. Despite the considerable allocation to the education sector, more investment should be considered to meet workforce requirements as per global standards. This also includes funding for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) research, digital learning, and industry-focused skills like AI and IoT. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) and subsidies for international students can further improve India's educational ecosystem, with the aim of making it a global education hub in the coming years.\n\n- Kuldip Sarma, pro-chancellor and co-founder, Medhavi Skills University\n\nIndia’s education landscape stands at a critical juncture. The Budget 2025 should not only bridge existing funding gaps but also propel us into the future by integrating next-generation technologies like AI, IoT, and robotics into mainstream curricula. By substantially increasing public spending on education and fostering robust industry-academia partnerships, we can build a globally competitive, job-ready workforce—one that will drive inclusive growth and bolster India’s standing as a leading knowledge economy.\n\n- Pravesh Dudani, Founder and Chancellor, Medhavi Skills University\n\n“As India aspires to establish itself as a global leader in education, sports, and innovation, the forthcoming Union Budget represents a pivotal opportunity to accelerate transformative progress across these critical sectors. Foremost, a significant allocation toward the development of world-class sporting infrastructure at universities is essential. This strategic investment will not only enhance India's preparedness to host the Youth Olympics 2030 and the Olympics 2036 but also foster a culture of fitness and athletic excellence among the nation's youth. By enabling students to pursue sports alongside academics, such initiatives align seamlessly with the vision of a healthier, more competitive India.\n\nFurthermore, augmented funding through the Department of Science and Technology (DST) is indispensable for establishing Centers of Excellence in advanced domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Aerospace, and Innovation. These centres will serve as catalysts for groundbreaking research, stimulate an ecosystem conducive to start-up growth, and cement India’s leadership in technological innovation on the global stage.\n\nEqually vital is the introduction of incentives for existing universities and educational institutions to create Distinguished Skill Universities. These institutions will address the critical skill gap by equipping the next generation with industry-relevant expertise, thereby driving employment opportunities and enhancing India's competitiveness in the international arena. A visionary budget that prioritizes these initiatives will serve as a cornerstone for India’s emergence as an economic and educational superpower in the 21st century.\"\n\n- Abhay G Chebbi, Pro-Chancellor, Alliance University\n\nA major concern for schools is the 18% GST on affiliation and accreditation services, which adds financial strain and limits resources for core functions. A review of this policy will help alleviate costs for schools. Besides, dedicated funds for skill-based learning and micro-credential courses are needed to materialize Education 4.0 by leveraging technologies like AI and robotics. Strengthening public-private partnerships (PPP) to create robust digital infrastructure and bridge the skills gap in school education should also be considered. The Centre’s focus on higher education, which now accounts for 40% of the education budget, must be complemented with increased investments in school education. Spending on research and innovation has surged, with IITs receiving 21.7% of higher education allocations in FY25. Similar attention to schools is necessary to ensure equitable progress across all educational levels.\n\n- Vishal Goel, co-founder, Crimson Schools\n\nAccording to the Economic Survey presented today, the school dropout rates have steadily declined in recent years, standing at 1.9 per cent for primary, 5.2 per cent for upper primary, and 14.1 per cent for secondary levels.\n\nHowever, challenges persist, with retention rates at 85.4 per cent for primary (class 1 to 5), 78 per cent for elementary (classes 1 to 8), 63.8 per cent for secondary (classes 1 to 10), and 45.6 per cent for higher secondary (classes 1 to 12).\n\nImprovements in basic facilities and infrastructure, including medical check-ups, sanitation, and information and communication technologies (ICT) availability, have been notable, reflecting a positive trend in school infrastructure development.\n\nThe NEP 2020 aims for a 100 per cent Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2030. The GER is near-universal at the primary (93 per cent) and the efforts are underway to bridge the gaps at the secondary (77.4 per cent) and higher secondary level (56.2 per cent), driving the nation closer to its vision of inclusive and equitable education for all, the Economic Survey stated.\n\nA day before the Budget 2025, the Union finance minister tabled the Economic Survey 2024-25 in the Parliament, which stated that India’s school education system serves 24.8 crore students across 14.72 lakh schools with 98 lakh teachers (UDISE+ 2023-24). Government schools make up 69 per cent of the total, enrolling 50 per cent of students and employing 51 per cent of teachers, while private schools account for 22.5 per cent, enrolling 32.6 per cent of students and employing 38 per cent of teachers.",

    "authors": ["George Mathew"],
    "raw_text": "This has happened at a time when banks managed to bring down overall gross NPAs from Rs 6.97 lakh crore (5.89 per cent of advances) in March 2022 to Rs 4.56 lakh crore (2.79 per cent) by March 2024.\n\nAccording to RBI data, credit card NPAs have shot up by 136 per cent from Rs 2,404 crore (1.82 per cent of advances) since March 2020 to Rs 5,679 crore (2.04 per cent) by June 2024. NPAs in the credit card segment rose by 39.46 per cent from Rs 4,072 crore in March 2023 by June 2024.\n\nBoth personal loans and credit card outstanding are unsecured in nature and carry high interest rates. A loan account becomes an NPA when the interest or principal instalment is more than 90 days overdue.\n\nWhen a customer delays repayment of his credit card bill beyond the billing cycle, the bank charges a high interest rate of 42-46 per cent interest per annum on the outstanding dues and his credit score also plummets.\n\nIn November 2023, the RBI had increased risk weight on the exposure of banks towards consumer credit, credit card receivables and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) by 25 per cent up to 150 per cent. The move was aimed to address build-up of any risks in these segments. “Even as inquiry volumes remain robust, the impact of increase in risk weights on certain segments of consumer credit pulled down the rate of growth in overall consumer credit, especially personal loans and credit cards,” the RBI’s FSR report said.\n\nThe unsecured business loans segment has started showing early signs of stress in asset quality, possibly due to the increasing competitive intensity among lenders, continuing pressure on cash flows in certain end-borrower segments, on-field attrition, lower-than-expected recoveries leading to higher write-offs and overleveraging of borrowers, India Ratings said in a report.\n\nCredit card use is rising rapidly in the country if the customer spends through this route, are any indication. The value of credit card transactions tripled in the last three years to Rs 18.31 lakh crore during the year ended March 2024 from Rs 6.30 lakh crore in March 2021 with the economy coming out of the problems created by the Covid pandemic and consumer confidence increasing steadily over the last several quarters.\n\nThe value of credit card transactions rose from Rs 6.30 lakh crore to Rs 9.71 lakh crore during the year ended March 2022 and Rs 14.32 lakh crore as of March 2023, according to Reserve Bank of India data. The monthly spends by card users are now above Rs 1.50 lakh crore and remained at Rs 176,202 crore in the month of September this year. It was Rs 72,319 crore in March 2021.\n\nThe number of credit cards issued by banks also rose rapidly to 10.61 crore as of September 2024 from 9.3 crore in September 2023, 7.36 crore in March 2022 and 6.20 crore in March 2021, RBI data shows.\n\nHowever, credit card outstanding has gone up to Rs 281,392 crore as of October 2024 as against Rs 249,635 crore in 2022. Card outstanding is the amount due from customers after the interest-free period offered by banks.\n\nWhat have lured customers to the credit card segment are incentives like rewards on higher spending, loan offers and lounge benefits. “Customers should realise that if they keep card dues beyond the interest-free period, they end up paying an interest rate of up to 42 per cent in some cases. It will put them in a debt trap,” said a bank official.",

    "title": "Building blocks of life found in samples from asteroid Bennu",
    "raw_text": "Two analyses of the samples were published on Wednesday.\n\nOne, in the journal Nature Astronomy, found that the samples contained a diverse mixture of organic compounds. And the other, in the journal Nature, found that the samples contained minerals formed when brine – salty water – evaporated on Bennu’s parent body, the type of wet environment where prebiotic organic chemistry may have brewed.\n\nPresent in the samples were 14 of the 20 organic compounds called amino acids that are used to make proteins – complex molecules that play indispensable roles in the structure, function and regulation of living organisms. Present also were all five nucleobases – the genetic components of DNA and RNA in all life on Earth.\n\nIn the early solar system, planets including Earth and various moons were pelted by asteroids and other space debris that carried water and chemicals including organic compounds.\n\n“The detection of these key building blocks of life in the Bennu samples supports the theory that asteroids and their fragments seeded the early Earth with the raw ingredients that led to the emergence of life,” said astrobiologist Danny Glavin of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, lead author of one of the studies.\n\n“In addition, the fact that these chemical building blocks of life can be formed in space and are widespread throughout the solar system increases the chances that life could have started beyond Earth,” Glavin added.\n\nOrganic compounds have one or more carbon atoms that are bound to other elements, usually hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. All life on Earth is based on carbon and is built from organic compounds including the amino acids used to create proteins and nucleobases.\n\nA nucleobase is a nitrogen-containing compound that stores genetic information. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) are biomolecular cousins that are fundamental molecules in cell biology. DNA contains an organism’s genetic code. RNA carries genetic information it receives from the DNA, putting this information into practice.\n\n“All biology is comprised of organic compounds. The origin of life is related to organic chemistry, some of which is preserved in these rocks from 4.5 billion years ago,” said astrobiologist and study co-author Jason Dworkin, the OSIRIS-REx project scientist.\n\nThe Bennu organic compounds all have been identified previously in meteorites that have landed on Earth. But there have been lingering questions because these meteorites could have been contaminated by terrestrial sources. The Bennu samples were obtained directly from an asteroid and were kept pristine.\n\n“We can trust these results,” Glavin said.\n\nBennu’s icy parent body, perhaps about 60 miles (100 km) in diameter, appears to have formed in the outer solar system and was later destroyed, possibly 1-2 billion years ago. The fragments then formed Bennu and other “rubble pile” asteroids – loose amalgamations of rocky material rather than solid objects.\n\nEarly in its history, some of the ice inside the parent body apparently melted and formed brine. The minerals formed in the evaporation of this brine had never previously been detected in meteorites that landed on Earth.\n\n“The brines provide an environment in which elements and simple organics could have combined to form more complex prebiotic organics on the pathway to life,” said geologist Tim McCoy, curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington and lead author of one of the studies.\n\nThe researchers did not find evidence of actual DNA or RNA in the samples.\n\n“The suite of simple protein amino acids and nucleobases that were found in Bennu are a long way from anything that could be considered ‘living,’ for example, a more complex self-sustaining chemical system that can replicate and evolve which is comprised of much larger polymers – proteins and nucleic acids – that are found in cells,” Glavin said.",

    "title": "Is your teenager using foul language? Here’s a guide to help them",
    "authors": ["Nishtha Grover"],
    "raw_text": "Help your teenager understand what is acceptable in your family by establishing clear rules about language use. Explain why foul language is inappropriate, emphasising respect and the impact of words. Be consistent in enforcing these rules for everyone in the household, including adults, to set a strong example. Use positive reinforcement to encourage respectful communication, conveying the idea that words matter. You might say, “We value kindness and respect in our home, and certain words don’t align with that,” to clarify your expectations while fostering a supportive environment.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTeenagers may not fully grasp how their words can affect others. You can help them understand this by sharing real-life examples of how language shapes social, academic, and professional perceptions, discussing how foul language can escalate conflicts or cause misunderstandings, and encouraging empathy by asking, “How would you feel if someone spoke to you that way?”\n\nOften, teenagers learn best from experience. You may use real moments as teaching opportunities:\n\n– Discuss the consequences calmly if they use inappropriate language in public or at school.\n\n– Encourage them to take responsibility, such as apologising if their words hurt someone.\n\n– Teach them that responding with silence or composure is often more powerful than retaliating with insults.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe goal isn’t just to stop the cursing, it’s to nurture emotional intelligence and self-expression, essential skills that will serve them well throughout life.",

    "authors": ["Debraj Deb"],
    "raw_text": "“Pithe and puli are the traditional Bengali rice cakes and sweets that hold a special place in winter harvest festivities. This three-day festival was aimed at reviving and showcasing the rich culinary traditions and cultural heritage of Bengalis, making it an unmissable event for food enthusiasts, culture lovers, and families alike,” said Joyshankar Bhattacharya, head of Totell Communications, an event management group, that has curated the ‘Pithe Puli’ festival which began on Friday.\n\nVisitors feasted on the exquisite array of rice cakes and sweets made from locally-sourced ingredients like rice flour, jaggery, and coconut displayed at the over 15 stalls.\n\nDebojyoti Saha, a medical representative, joined hands with his wife in their stall ‘Smoke of Longtrai’ where they put up a variety of traditional rice cakes as well as chicken and pork chunks on barbecue, with a lot of desi jugaad that involves a hair-dryer, a small electric table-fan and a ‘haat-pakha’ or traditional handheld palm-leaf fan.\n\nHis wife runs a cloud kitchen, ‘Smoke of Longtrai’. “We have been participating in ‘Petuker Samaresh’ – another local food festival for a few years. People have been coming here. They are checking out our items. We are very hopeful of getting food traction with these traditional cakes,” he said.\n\nLikewise, Raja Debnath, a logistics executive, is happy to have received positive response from the visitors who tried out his variety of ‘pithe puli’ and other uncommon melange of products. His stall offered a range of products from cakes and pastries to ‘Wahan Mosdeng’ or indigenous pork salad ‘tohan mosdeng’ to chicken salad with ‘bangui’ to indigenous Tripuri sticky rice cakes.\n\n“I know this is about Bengali traditional pithe-puli. But traditional Tripuri rice cakes are a sort of ‘pithe’ as well – in a way like our conventional cakes and pastries. We have sort of tried to expand the idea of a pithe-puli. People have been positive,” he said.\n\nChiranjit Roy, another medical representative, who had his stall at the festival said he does food business as a side-gig. He operates two cloud kitchens – one veg and the other non-veg with plans to shift into full-time restaurant business.\n\nA stall by a group of women sounded interesting with its Bengali name ‘Khejure Alaap’, literally translating to casual gossip, blended with a bit of pun. ‘Khejure’ also refers to date palms and a syrupy jaggery made from dates in the winters.\n\nStall-hoppers also said they enjoyed munching pakodas and piping hot tea varieties at counters on a winter evening.\n\n“It (kulhad chai) is a good tea and it was nice to have it with the traditional Bengali pithe. People tend to forget traditional cuisine and all. I feel this a great thing, especially in a city that’s trying to rise from being a traditional township into a major city,” said Manishankar Das, a post graduate student at Agartala.\n\nIn addition to culinary delights, the festival featured an array of traditional fashion shows, recitations, alpona (rangoli) competitions, cultural performances like folk dance and musical performances.\n\nThe event was presented by Mukti Sangha, in collaboration with Amar Tripura and curated by Agartala Events For You, a new venture by Totell.",

Therefore, this could be a critical time to intervene and help them integrate different ways to be sufficiently active,” Bajpai explained.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAlthough the trend is changing, most Indian households have defined gender roles, where household responsibilities still fall on women.

An accelerated heart rate can speed up atherosclerosis,’ says Dr Bimal Chhajer, cardiologist, former consultant at AIIMS and founder of SAAOL Heart Institute\n\nLove your wine and beer? Is there a safe limit for drinking alcohol?Subscriber Only\n\nNew WHO data says there is no safe limit. “Besides cancers at different sites, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, pancreatitis and neurologic and mental health disorders, road traffic accidents are linked to alcohol. Even small amounts of alcohol can disturb brain function by affecting neuronal transmission. Some effects are temporary but many cause long lasting damage,’ says Dr K Srinath Reddy, distinguished professor, PHFI\n\nFatty liver can trigger diabetes: Why you should lose 5-10% body weight to reverse itSubscriber Only\n\nFat in the liver increases insulin resistance. As insulin resistance increases, the pancreas tries to overcome it by working harder and gradually gets fatigued, accelerating the development of Type 2 diabetes. Once people have diabetes, they have an even greater risk of developing fatty liver.

This is about a dialectic between two individuals – and it could be any two people, each with their own personalities, experiences, beliefs and priorities. No matter what the relationship, trust requires effort, respect and transparency, says Dr Samir Parikh, Director, Fortis Mental Health Programme\n\nCan the new Alzheimer’s drug, Lecanemab, be effective enough?Subscriber Only\n\n‘There are various scales for measuring cognitive decline. A good example would be a patient, who is soiling, starting to tell the caregivers that they need to go to the bathroom. And in this context, the medicine approved now has an edge over the previous one,’ says Dr MV Padma Shrivastava, head of the neurosciences centre at AIIMS\n\nIncorrect posture, long hours at desk, heavy weights can cause sciaticaSubscriber Only\n\nNine out of 10 patients get pain relief with conservative management and various epidural injections. But a good physical regime will prevent it in the first place, says Dr Vivek Loomba,Consultant Pain Physician at the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, New Delhi\n\nKnow why beetroot is great for heart, diabetes and gut healthSubscriber Only\n\nIt is a good source of manganese, which is involved in the production of insulin and helps in stabilising blood sugar levels. Nitrate, found in high concentrations, may help reduce insulin resistance, says Dr Eileen Canday, Head of Department of Nutrition & Dietetics at Sir H. N. Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai\n\nCan a simple blood test hold the key to detecting Alzheimer’s?Subscriber Only\n\nDr Pravat Mandal, a researcher from the National Brain Research Centre, believes that the levels of the antioxidant glutathione and iron in critical parts of the brain are predictors of Alzheimer’s. With a specialised MRI machine that can detect chemical compounds in the brain, he is awaiting a trial to be conducted with AIIMS\n\nLiving with diabetes since 25, as a hidden cost of her PCOS, this young painter believes disease has disciplined herSubscriber Only\n\nShaiqa Shaukat has pulled back from the brink after making the costly error of skipping diabetes screening when she was diagnosed with PCOS, which leads to insulin resistance and obesity. Considering that most Indians are risk-prone, given their genetic history and aggravating triggers like dyslipidemia and hypertension, anybody with PCOS should immediately go for a simple oral glucose tolerance test\n\nHow simple yoga practices can help in getting rid of addictionsSubscriber Only\n\nPranayama helps in invigorating the life force or prana of the person and most importantly, brings about self-awareness, starting with the simple act of watching your own breath. Most acts of addiction are compulsive. As you progress in the practice of breath observation, you automatically imbibe self-awareness, says yoga guru Kamini Bobde\n\nWhat are dos and don’ts for older adults this winterSubscriber Only\n\nOlder people lose body heat faster and do not know when the big chill catches up with them or when they can quickly descend into hypothermia, says Dr Bimal Chhajer, cardiologist, former consultant at AIIMS, and founder of SAAOL Heart Institute.\n\nCovishield immune responses against COVID-19 variants higher than Covaxin, says studySubscriber Only\n\n‘Our study findings indicate that a higher frequency of Covishield recipients show the presence of antibodies post-vaccination as compared to Covaxin,’ says Dr Vineeta Bal, an immunologist from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune and one of the study authors\n\nHow breastfeeding mothers can help their babies sleep betterSubscriber Only\n\nBreastfeeding is one of the most convenient and powerful tools when it comes to managing newborn sleep as breastmilk contains sleep hormones, says Infant and Child Sleep Specialist Himani Dalmia\n\nCan intermittent fasting reverse diabetes? How does it work ?Subscriber Only\n\nIntermittent Fasting of any variety is not recommended for all diabetics.

'This means eliminating butter, oil and red meat. Blended ones are the best, say a 30:70 blend of safflower with rice bran,' says endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai\n\nCan 6,000 to 9,000 steps a day keep heart attacks at bay among older adults? Study says soSubscriber Only\n\nThe scientific reason behind this is any physical activity will increase the heart rate. A heart rate more than 100 during activity will increase the cardiac output and blood circulation. This will cause consumption of blood sugar and fat forming agents like triglycerides and cholesterol, say experts\n\nIs your BP not going down despite medicines and causing headaches? Stay away from painkillersSubscriber Only\n\nSustained high pressure can sometimes lead to sharp headaches and most patients go for ibuprofen to relieve themselves of pain.

    "authors": ["Express Web Desk"],
    "raw_text": "Bodies recovered from Potomac River\n\nBy Thursday, first responders had pulled at least 28 bodies from the icy waters of the Potomac River, where the wreckage of the American Airlines Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet and the Black Hawk helicopter was scattered. The jetliner, en route from Wichita, Kansas, was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. The helicopter had three military personnel aboard.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nImages from the scene showed parts of the plane’s fuselage submerged in waist-deep water, its wing jutting out amid a search operation involving boats and divers. “We are now at the point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation,” John Donnelly, the fire chief for Washington, DC, said in a press conference.\n\nAirspace concerns\n\nThe collision occurred just three miles from the White House and the US Capitol, in airspace that ranks among the most scrutinized in the world. The American Airlines plane was making its final approach to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport when the helicopter reportedly flew into its path, leading to the fatal crash.\n\nPreliminary information indicates the helicopter was operating under visual flight rules and may have flown higher than the 200-foot ceiling it was required to maintain. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said altitude seemed to be a factor, but emphasized the need for further analysis before drawing conclusions.\n\nFAA under scrutiny for staffing and procedures\n\nQuestions have already been raised about air traffic control procedures that night. A report by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), obtained by news agency Associated Press, revealed that a single controller was managing both helicopter traffic and the arrival of planes at Reagan National at the time of the crash—a role that is typically divided between two controllers.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe decision to combine these positions earlier than usual was made by the tower supervisor. While this configuration is standard practice during periods of low air traffic, an anonymous source familiar with the matter noted that the decision was made ahead of schedule that night.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, speaking at a White House news conference, criticized the FAA’s handling of the incident, even as federal investigators cautioned that the exact cause remains unknown. Trump also used the opportunity to launch a broader political attack, blaming diversity hiring policies at the FAA for what he called “slipping standards.”\n\nInvestigators search for answers\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has begun its investigation, retrieving the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder from the wreckage of the Bombardier CRJ700. Both devices are being analyzed at the NTSB’s lab.\n\nAccording to data from the jet’s transponder, the aircraft was flying at 400 feet, preparing to land at a speed of 140 mph when it suddenly lost altitude moments before the collision. Flight logs also indicate that controllers had redirected the jetliner to a shorter runway just minutes before the crash.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe NTSB has confirmed that an air traffic controller asked the helicopter crew whether they had the arriving jetliner in sight. The helicopter crew responded affirmatively and requested “visual separation,” meaning they could fly closer than normal since they had the other aircraft in view. The two aircraft collided seconds later.\n\nAn hour of anguish\n\nPresident Trump opened Thursday’s news conference with a moment of silence for the crash victims, calling it an “hour of anguish” for the nation. Throughout the day, at Reagan National Airport, a subdued atmosphere pervaded as passengers awaited the resumption of flights. Many stared out at the Potomac River, where the wreckage of the plane was partially visible in the distance.\n\n“I’ve been crying since yesterday,” said Aster Andemicael, who had been waiting for a flight to Indiana with her father when the crash occurred. “This is devastating.”\n\nDeadliest US air disaster since 2001\n\nWednesday’s tragedy marks the deadliest plane crash in the United States since November 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed into a residential neighborhood in Queens, New York, killing all 260 people aboard.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAlthough aviation experts are quick to highlight that flying remains one of the safest forms of travel, Wednesday’s crash is a grim reminder of the dangers present in even the most controlled environments, such as the airspace surrounding Washington DC.\n\nJust over a day before the collision, another regional jetliner had to abort its landing at Reagan National due to the proximity of a military helicopter. That aircraft circled and landed safely minutes later.",

    "raw_text": "Guantanamo Bay’s role in immigration detention\n\nGuantanamo Bay, widely known as “Gitmo,” has been used to house terrorism suspects since the September 11, 2001, attacks, but it also has a small, separate facility known as the Migrant Operations Centre. This centre has historically held migrants intercepted while attempting to enter the US by boat, primarily from Haiti and Cuba.\n\nThe facility occupies only a small part of the base and currently lacks the capacity to house the 30,000 detainees, Trump suggested.

A White House statement clarified that the facility would provide additional detention space for “high-priority criminal aliens unlawfully present in the United States.”\n\nAn anonymous administration official told reporters that the facility would detain “dangerous criminals” and individuals who are “hard to deport.” Some countries refuse to accept deported individuals, complicating removal efforts.\n\nWhat are the conditions at the centre?\n\nThe International Refugee Assistance Project described the existing migrant centre as maintaining “prison-like” conditions where detainees are “trapped in a punitive system” with little oversight. Deepa Alagesan, a senior supervising attorney at the organisation, estimated that only a few dozen people are currently held at the centre and expressed concern about expanding its capacity.\n\n“It’s definitely a scary prospect,” Alagesan said.\n\nChallenges in immigration detention",

    "title": "Washington DC Plane Crash Live: US military helicopter ‘flying too high’, alleges President Trump",
    "authors": ["Express Web Desk"],
    "raw_text": "19:24 (IST) 31 Jan 2025\n\nWashington DC Plane Crash Live Updates: President Trump says helicopter 'flying too high'\n\nUS President Donald took to his own social media platform Truth Social and alleged that the US military's Black Hawk helicopter was flying \"too high\" than its limit. However, his claims cannot be verified as investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board are underway. The agency is expected to come out with a preliminary report in the next 30 days. In a post on his own social media , Trump wrote:\n\n19:09 (IST) 31 Jan 2025\n\nWashington DC Plane Crash Live Updates: Reagan National, a challenging airport to land\n\nThe National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the Department of Transportation tell a similar story. But the airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots no matter how ideal the conditions, reports AP. They must navigate hundreds of other commercial planes, military aircraft and restricted areas around sensitive sites. Just over 24 hours before the fatal collision, a different regional jet had to go around for a second chance at landing at Reagan National after it was advised about a military helicopter nearby, according to flight tracking sites and control logs. It landed safely minutes later.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking with the BBC, Mo Khimji, a pilot who regularly flies in and out of Reagan National Airport says the airport and surrounding airspace are extremely congested and that even with all the superb training pilots find it challenging.\n\n“If we are landing on the river and we have a strong right to left crosswind, we have to be cognizant of it. A late turn can result in that wind pushing us into the restricted airspace by a whisker,\" Mo adds.\n\n19:00 (IST) 31 Jan 2025\n\nWashington DC Plane Crash Live Updates: Low staffing, weather, altitude--What might have caused the crash?\n\nOne air traffic controller was responsible for coordinating helicopter traffic and arriving and departing planes when the collision happened, according to a report by the Federal Aviation Administration that was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThose duties are often divided between two people, but the airport typically combines the roles at 9:30 pm, once traffic begins to slow down. On Wednesday the tower supervisor directed that they be combined earlier.\n\n“The position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,” the report said.\n\nA person familiar with the matter, however, said the tower staffing that night was at a normal level. The positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away from the console for breaks, during shift changes or when air traffic is slow, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures.\n\nThe FAA has long struggled with a shortage of air traffic controllers. Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas.\n\n“Both pilots had flown this specific route before, at night. This wasn’t something new to either one of them,” said Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation.The helicopter's maximum allowed altitude at the time was 200 feet (about 60 meters), Koziol said. It was not immediately clear whether it exceeded that limit, but Hegseth said altitude seemed to be a factor in the collision.

    "raw_text": "Trump’s order directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; house transgender women in men’s prisons; and cease funding for any gender-affirming medical care for inmates.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on Sunday by the inmate, known by the pseudonym Maria Moe, and was soon after sealed. O’Toole, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, lifted the seal on Thursday as a hearing was underway on whether he should grant her further relief.\n\nHer case was filed by lawyers at two LGBTQ rights groups including GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, or GLAD, which after the case was unsealed confirmed that O’Toole had on Sunday issued a temporary restraining order that will remain in place while he considers whether to issue a longer-lasting injunction.\n\nThe judge’s order requires prison officials to keep the inmate in the general population in a women’s facility and maintain her medical care, GLAD said. Jennifer Levi, a lawyer for the inmate at GLAD, called it a relief her client “is staying put for now.”\n\nO’Toole is still considering whether to issue a longer preliminary injunction. Three other transgender women in prison filed a similar lawsuit on Thursday in Washington, D.C., also challenging Trump’s policy. The US Attorney’s Office in Boston declined to comment.\n\nMoe’s lawyers said that a day after Trump signed his order, officials with the federal Bureau of Prisons informed her she was being transferred from a women’s prison to a men’s facility, exposing her to an “extremely high risk of harassment, abuse, violence, and sexual assault.”\n\nHer lawyers said the Bureau of Prisons switched how it publicly identified her from “female” to “male” and had been poised to cut off the inmate’s access to hormones she has taken since she was a teenager to treat her gender dysphoria.\n\nHer lawyers argued that Trump’s executive order discriminated based on sex in violation of the plaintiff’s due process rights under the US Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe lawyers argued that her impending transfer to a men’s prison also would violate the US Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.",

    "raw_text": "On Maha Kumbh’s big day, at least 30 killed, 60 injured in stampede\n\nSyllabus:\n\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.\n\nMains Examination: General Studies III: Disaster and disaster management.\n\nWhat’s the ongoing story: Thirty people died and at least 60 were injured in a pre-dawn stampede Wednesday at the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj where hundreds of thousands gathered to take a dip at the Sangam.\n\nKey Points to Ponder:\n\n• What is stampede\n\n• What triggered stampede in Mahakumbh?\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n• What are the primary causes of stampedes during large religious gatherings like the Mahakumbh?\n\n• How do people die at these events?\n\n• ‘These kind of events exposes lax safety rules and regulatory failures’-Discuss\n\n• What role did the ‘rumour’ play in these events?\n\n• “A rumour can kill thousands than a bullet can”-Decode the quote with respect to stampede and rumour\n\n• Is there any National Guide on Crowd Management in India?\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n• Suggest measures for effective crowd management in events like Mahakumbh\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n• The stampede took place in the early hours of Wednesday (January 29), a day unusually large crowds were flocking to the riverbank for the ritual dip. This was because January 29 is Mauni Amavasya, one of the days considered very auspicious for taking a bath at the Kumbh Mela. PTI had reported that 10 crore pilgrims were expected to make their way to the Maha Kumbh in just a day on January 29.\n\n• The incident took place shortly after 1.30 am as people headed towards the Sangam Nose – it’s the strip of land at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati – for a ritual bath on the day of Mauni Amavasya which is considered auspicious.\n\n• The dead and injured were taken to medical facilities on the Maha Kumbh grounds and to hospitals in the city. Following the incident, the snans (ritual bath) were halted but resumed in the afternoon. Officials estimated that over 10 crore people had taken a dip in the waters until evening.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n• Officials blamed the incident on the heavy rush towards the Sangam Nose and felling of barricades on the route meant for akharas headed for the Amrit Snan.\n\n• Witnesses said the stampede took place when a crowd going towards the Sangam ran into those returning. Other witnesses said barricades along the route meant for the akharas were felled and people charged towards the Sangam Nose.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• Mauni Amavasya is the new moon night of the krishna paksha (the waning moon fortnight) of the Hindu month of Magh. On this day, both the Sun and Moon are in the same raashi of Makar (Capricorn), which makes it astrologically significant. Maun means silence, and on Mauni Amavasya, it is believed that observing silence, at least till before one takes a bath, is beneficial.\n\n• “According to Hindu religious beliefs, taking a ritual bath in a river on Mauni Amavasya washes away one’s sins. Triveni in Prayagraj (the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati) is considered a sacred spot. Taking a dip in the Triveni on a Mauni Amavasya during Kumbh Mela is, thus, of added spiritual significance,” Dr Ramesh Kumar Upadhyay, president of the Bhartiya Jyotish Aadhyatm parishad in Jamshedpur, said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n• About why silence is observed on this day, Upadhyay said, “The new moon is a day of big happenings in the world of nature. The high tide and low tide are more pronounced, the moon is between the earth and the sun. On such a day, when nature is so dynamic, Hindu sages have advised stillness and silence for humans.”\n\n• In the ongoing Kumbh, Makar Sankranti was the first amrit snan (earlier called shahi snan) day, and Mauni Amavasya the second. The third is Vasant Panchami on February 3. Shiv Ratri, which falls on February 26, the last day of the Kumbh Mela, is also significant.\n\n• On these days, the saadhus who gather at the Kumbh take the first ritual dip as part of the amrit snan, followed by other devotees. It is the specific planetary alignments of a day that make it specially auspicious.\n\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n\n📍When unbridled devotion led to disaster: Remembering the 1954 Kumbh Mela stampede\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nUPSC Previous Year Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n\n1.

Failure to register carries a jail term up to six months. This applies to residents of Uttarakhand as well as state residents living elsewhere in India\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n• The Rules, which came into effect January 2, outline the documentation required for the registration process – it can be done both offline and online.\n\n• Rule 15 (3) in Chapter 5 outlines the “information to be included in the Statement of Live-in Relationship”. These documents are to be attached with a 16-page form – Form 3 of the Annexures to the Rules by those “already in a live-in relationship or intending to enter into a live-in relationship”.\n\n• The Rules require in prescribed format “proof of permissibility of marriage between the registrants if they are within the degrees of prohibited relationship”.\n\n• For proof of previous history of relationship, the Rules require details of “marital or live-in relationship prior to the onset of the current live-in relationship”. These documents could include final decree of divorce; final decree annulling a marriage; death certificate of a spouse; certificate of terminated live-in relationship. For marriages dissolved under customary religious practices, then proof of such dissolution would be required.\n\n• Under the UCC, the Registrar has powers to issue notice on his own or on the basis of a complaint to an individual to register their live-in relationship. Additionally, apart from conducting a summary inquiry into the veracity of the documents, the Registrar has to inform the legal guardian or parent of the parties registering their live-in relationship if they are below age 21.\n\n• The law states that the registration is only for the “purposes of record keeping.” However, the Rules require the Registrar to forward these registrations to the local police stations where the couple resides and makes it mandatory for landlords to demand a “provisional” or final certificate of registration of the live-in relationship.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution provides that both the Centre and state legislatures can legislate on matters pertaining to family laws.\n\n• The Code applies to residents of the state, but only to those who identify within the binary genders of male and female who are in heterosexual relationships, thus leaving most LGBT persons outside its ambit.\n\n• The Code, which borrows significantly from secular laws such as The Special Marriage Act, 1954, and The Indian Succession Act, 1925, repeals all family laws — secular, personal, and customary — to the extent that they are inconsistent with it.\n\n• The Code defines live-in relationships as a relationship in the “nature of marriage” between a man and a woman cohabiting in a shared household, and requires compulsory registration of live-in relationships through a “statement of live-in relationship”.\n\n• A live-in relationship may be terminated by either of the parties to the live-in relationship by submitting a “statement of termination”.\n\nFailure to register a live-in relationship within one month of entering into the relationship has been criminalised, with punishment up to\n\nthree months in jail or fine not exceeding Rs 10,000.\n\n• The Registrar may require the parties to submit the statement of live-in relationship, through a notice, on his/ her own motion or on a complaint filed by a third party.\n\n• A progressive reform reflected in the Code pertains to the abolishment of the concept of “illegitimate children”.\n\nAt present, parent-child relations are governed by both secular and personal laws on guardianship, which discriminate against children born out of wedlock by deeming them illegitimate and not granting them rights at par with children born within wedlock. While courts have attempted to extend certain rights to children born out of wedlock specifically in matters pertaining to inheritance under Hindu law, as well as maintenance, the concept of an “illegitimate” child continues to prevail.\n\n• The Uttarakhand UCC treats children born in void and voidable marriages, as well as children born in live-in relationships, as legitimate.\n\n• One striking feature of the Code is that it abolishes the coparcenary system, which exists under Hindu personal law. Under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, property can be held as coparcenary property or self-acquired property. Four generations of Hindus hold ancestral property as coparceners. Self-acquired property is individual property, and passes as per rules for intestate succession on death.\n\n• The share of the deceased in the coparcenary property forms part of the property pool again. Consequently, for a person to get their individual share in coparcenary property, the property has to be partitioned. The Uttarakhand UCC does away with the coparcenary system, and extends the same scheme of succession to all persons irrespective of religion.

Are their adherents non-Hindu and non-Sikh?\n\n• Does the Collector possess any authority over Hindu and Sikh endowments?\n\n• Why was the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 has been referred to the Joint Committee of Parliament?\n\n• Why Joint Committee of Parliament said about the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024?\n\n• Discuss the significance of parliamentary oversight on issues like Waqf properties.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n• On the ‘Waqf by user’ issue, which implies that if a property is being used as Waqf it will continue to be so, the committee is learnt to be of the view that the removal of the provision from the legislation will not have an impact on registered Waqf in the absence of a Waqf deed.\n\n• The committee, it is learnt, has suggested that the omission of ‘Waqf by user’ from the definition of Waqf should apply prospectively, and that cases of existing Waqf properties already registered as ‘Waqf by user’ not be reopened.\n\n• The committee, however, is of the view that this clause should be subject to the condition that the property is not involved in a dispute or is a government property.\n\n• The Waqf Act of 1995 states that “Waqf includes a Waqf by user, but such Waqf shall not cease to be a Waqf by reason only of the user having ceased irrespective of the period of such cesser.”\n\n• When the proposed Bill was tabled in Parliament in August last year, it had sought to omit the provisions relating to ‘Waqf by user’, making a Waqf property suspect in the absence of a valid Waqf deed.\n\n• It is learnt that the committee, while noting submissions made by the tenants’ associations about their long-term association with Waqf properties, has underlined the need to address their concerns compassionately during the formulation of lease rules.\n\n• The panel wants the Ministry of Minority Affairs to consider the concerns of Waqf tenants across the country and introduce laws that allow for long-term leases to keep their legitimate rights safe.\n\n• It is learnt that the committee is of the view that protection should be given to Scheduled Tribes and tribal lands under provisions of the Constitution.\n\nIt wants the Ministry of Minority Affairs to take legislative steps to stall declaration of tribal lands as Waqf land so that scheduled areas and tribal areas are protected.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• Waqf refers to properties dedicated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law, and any other use or sale of the property is prohibited.\n\n—Waqf means that the ownership of the property is now taken away from the person making Waqf and transferred and detained by Allah.\n\n— ‘Waqif’ is a person who creates a waqf for the beneficiary.\n\n—As Waqf properties are bestowed upon Allah, in the absence of a physically tangible entity, a ‘mutawalli’ is appointed by the waqif, or by a competent authority, to manage or administer a Waqf. —Once designated as waqf, the ownership is transferred from the person making the waqf (waqif) to Allah, making it irrevocable.\n\n—In India, the history of Waqf can be traced back to the early days of the Delhi Sultanate when Sultan Muizuddin Sam Ghaor dedicated two villages in favour of the Jama Masjid of Multan and handed its administration to Shaikhul Islam.\n\n—As the Delhi Sultanate and later Islamic dynasties flourished in India, the number of Waqf properties kept increasing in India.\n\n—There was a case made for the abolition of Waqfs in India in the late 19th Century when a dispute over a Waqf property ended up in the Privy Council of London during the days of the British Raj.\n\n—The four British judges who heard the case described the Waqf as “a perpetuity of the worst and the most pernicious kind” and declared Waqf to be invalid. However, the decision by the four judges was not accepted in India, and the Mussalman Waqf Validating Act of 1913 saved the institution of Waqf in India. Since then, no attempt has been made to curb Waqfs.\n\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n\n📍Waqf panel clears 14 amendments by NDA MPs, rejects 44 by Opposition\n\nEXPRESS NETWORK\n\nSC: Domicile-based quota in PG medical courses unconstitutional\n\nSyllabus:\n\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.\n\nMains Examination: General Studies II: Issues relating to development and management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health, Education, Human Resources.\n\nWhat’s the ongoing story: THE SUPREME Court on Wednesday held that domicile-based reservation for admission to post-graduate medical courses within the State quota is unconstitutional as it violates the Right to Equality under Article 14.\n\nKey Points to Ponder:\n\n• What’s the domicile quota?\n\n• Examine the constitutional provisions related to educational reservations in India.\n\n• How does the Supreme Court’s verdict on domicile-based reservations for PG medical admissions align with constitutional provisions?\n\n• Analyse the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision striking down domicile-based reservation for PG medical courses on medical education in India.\n\n• Discuss the conflict between domicile-based reservations and merit-based admissions in higher education, with reference to the Supreme Court’s latest ruling.\n\n• What are the key differences between undergraduate and postgraduate medical admissions in India regarding reservation policies?\n\n• Explain the role of the National Medical Commission (NMC) in regulating medical education in India.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n• “So far as question… whether providing for domicile/residence-based reservation in admission to PG medical courses within the State quota is constitutionally invalid and impermissible is concerned, our answer is in the affirmative. Yes, it is constitutionally invalid. In other words, providing for domicile or residence-based reservation in PG medical courses is constitutionally impermissible and cannot be done,” said a three-Judge Bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy, Sudhanshu Dhulia and S V N Bhatti.\n\n• Writing for the Bench, Justice Dhulia said: “We are all domiciled in the territory of India. We are all residents of India. Our common bond as citizens and residents of one country gives us the right not only to choose our residence anywhere in India, but also gives us the right to carry on trade and business or a profession anywhere in India. It also gives us the right to seek admission in educational institutions across India.”\n\n• The court said that while such reservation may be permissible “to a certain degree” in MBBS courses, it is impermissible in PG medical courses.\n\n• “The benefit of reservation in educational institutions, including medical colleges, to those who reside in a particular State can be given to a certain degree only in MBBS courses, for which we have assigned reasons in preceding paragraphs. But considering the importance of specialist doctors in PG medical course, reservation at the higher level on the basis of residence would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India,” the court said.\n\n• “If such a reservation is permitted, it would be an invasion on the fundamental rights of several students who are being treated unequally simply for the reason that they belong to a different State in the Union. This would be a violation of the equality clause in Article 14 of the Constitution and would amount to a denial of equality before the law,” it said.\n\n• “The State quota seats, apart from a reasonable number of institution-based reservations, have to be filled strictly on the basis of merit in all-India examination,” the court said, while adding that its decision would not affect admissions already granted on the basis of domicile-based reservation.\n\n• “Domicile in normal parlance denotes ‘the place of living’ or permanent residence. The legal concept is, however, different,” the court said. “The very concept of a provincial or State domicile in India is a misconception. There is only one domicile in India, which we refer to as domicile in the territory of India as given under Article 52. All Indians have only one domicile, which is the Domicile of India,” it said.\n\n• The Bench also noted that in Dr Pradeep Jain vs Union of India, the SC had, in 1984, explained why residence-based reservation in PG medical courses was violative of Article 14, and such reservation may be permissible in MBBS courses.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• For postgraduate medical seats, the Centre conducts counselling for only 50% of the total intake while the rest is filled by state counseling bodies as per their own rules. Within this remaining 50%, states earmark a quota for ‘domicile’ candidates.\n\n• SC ruling on domicile-based reservation: Key points\n\n—Violation of Article 14: The Court stated that the practice of domicile-based reservation in PG medical admissions goes against the Right to Equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution.\n\n—Right to choose residence and profession: Justice Dhulia, reading out the operative part of the judgment, emphasised that all Indian citizens are entitled to a single domicile — that of India. Citizens have the right to reside anywhere in the country, practice any profession and seek educational opportunities anywhere without restrictions.\n\n—Reservations only permissible in MBBS courses: While the Court acknowledged that some degree of domicile-based reservation in undergraduate (MBBS) courses after NEET UG might be permissible, it categorically stated that this should not extend to PG medical courses due to their specialised nature.\n\n—Clarification on existing reservations: The ruling clarified that it would not affect any domicile-based reservations that have already been granted for PG medical admissions prior to the judgement.\n\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n\n📍NEET PG: SC declares domicile-based reservation for postgraduate medical admissions unconstitutional\n\nUPSC Practice Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n\n3.

It showed a 24 per cent reduced risk of worsening kidney disease and kidney failure (end-stage kidney disease) and also led to a 4.9 per cent risk reduction in death from cardiovascular disease.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• Ozempic contains semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA), which mimics the function of a hormone released by the intestine after eating. It lowers blood sugar by helping the pancreas make more of the glucose-regulating hormone called insulin. It can also help with weight loss by reducing appetite and increasing the feeling of “fullness”.\n\n• The FDA approval is significant for India, where Ozempic will likely be available soon. “Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease so the medicine will be beneficial on a large scale.

Discuss whether they are complementary or contradictory.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nRajat Kathuria, Neha Gupta Writes:\n\n• In the upcoming budget, we expect to hear announcements relating to reducing the trade deficit, stemming the rupee’s depreciation and promoting exports — all in the same breath.\n\n• It is widely felt that India’s relatively high tariff rates are inimical to more integration into GVCs. It is also true that customs duties are no longer an important source of overall tax revenue, but rather an instrument to accomplish other policy objectives, one of which is protectionism. US President Donald Trump levied tariffs on ChFinese imports in 2018, citing its unfair practice of state support for enterprises.\n\n• China retaliated, which led to an escalation of tensions. Trade wars hurt everybody. Although Trump says “tariff” is his “favourite word in the dictionary” and that he would use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing, he has held off on the 60 per cent increase he had promised on the campaign trail. Instead, 10 per cent is all that is supposed to be levied on specific Chinese goods beginning February 1. Perhaps the message in Trump dialling down is that tariffs are not the best way to boost local manufacturing in an interconnected world.\n\n• India will do well to internalise that lesson. Combined with high tariffs, frequent changes do not help. An example is the fluctuating tariff on components used in mobile phone manufacturing. Lenses for camera modules in phones, initially duty-free in 2019, were subject to a 2.5 per cent duty in 2021, only to become duty-free again in 2023.\n\n• Similarly, PCBAs and moulded plastics for phone chargers faced a duty hike of 10 per cent in 2018, which was further increased to 15 per cent in 2021. While parts of chargers became zero duty in 2018, these were subsequently taxed at 10 per cent in 2021. The last budget saw a reduction in the basic customs duty on mobile phones, their chargers and PCBAs to 15 per cent from the 20 per cent imposed in the 2018-20 period.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• India’s export growth remains stagnant; its share in global exports lingers around two per cent. Lowering customs duties and stabilising policy are, however, unlikely to be sufficient either in the upcoming budget or subsequently.\n\n• Trade policy requires comprehensive reform, including the establishment of a dedicated committee to ensure policy consistency and to formulate an action plan to achieve the objective of $2 trillion in exports by 2030.\n\n• In this regard, the recent declaration by the CEO of NITI Aayog that “India is one of the few (big) economies which is not a part of large trade agreements” needs serious evaluation. Mega trade blocs such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) are reshaping global trade, but India is ambivalent about their utility.\n\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n\n📍Pharma & consumer goods: Donald Trump’s tariff threats, and where India could feel the heat\n\nUPSC Previous Year Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n\n5.

How do their official statements reflect changes in their foreign policy approaches?\n\n• Analyse the key challenges in India-China relations, focusing on border disputes, trade imbalances, and geopolitical tensions.\n\n• What diplomatic steps can be taken to improve bilateral ties?\n\n• Examine the role of high-level diplomatic dialogues, such as the Special Representatives (SR) talks and Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination (WMCC), in resolving India-China border tensions.\n\n• Evaluate the impact of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on India-China relations.\n\n• Why has India consistently opposed the BRI?\n\n• Analyse the implications of India’s trade deficit with China and the steps required to address it.\n\n• How does the India-China border dispute impact regional security in South Asia?\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n• These decisions were arrived at after Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, during a recent China visit, met the country’s Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and Minister of International Department of the Communist Party of China Liu Jianchao.\n\nBut the fine print of the two countries’ statements reveal convergences and divergences in their approach.\n\n• While India talked about what was “agreed” between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping in Kazan, China talked about the “important consensus” reached by the leaders.\n\n• India said they “reviewed the state of India-China bilateral relations comprehensively” and agreed to take certain “people-centric steps to stabilise and rebuild ties”. So, the focus is on “review” and “people-centric steps”.\n\n• China said that they were discussing measures for the “improvement and development” of China-India relations, and that the two sides reached “consensus” on specific measures. Thus, Delhi’s statement is more nuanced and cautious, while Beijing has a more optimistic assessment of the talks.\n\n• On Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, the two statements almost echo each other, but the Chinese statement reflects more urgency, with a mention of “as soon as possible”. The Indian statement said the two sides “decided to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in the summer of 2025; the relevant mechanism will discuss the modalities for doing so as per existing agreements”. The Chinese statement said: “The two sides agreed to resume the Indian pilgrims’ visit to Kailash Mansarovar in Xizang Autonomous Region, China in 2025, and will discuss relevant arrangements as soon as possible.”\n\n• On direct flights, a careful reading of the two statements shows that Delhi wants a new pact, while China has linked it to visas and resident journalists.\n\n• On trans-border rivers like the Brahmaputra, both sides agreed to hold an early meeting of India-China Expert Level Mechanism. This will involve sharing of data, which has been an issue recently.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• On the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of ties — the two countries had established diplomatic ties in 1949 — the emphasis is again\n\na bit different. While the Indian government is looking at “restoring public trust”, the Chinese have linked it to visas. While China claims it is issuing a large number of visas to Indian nationals, Indian visa issuances to Chinese nationals have reportedly crashed from around 2 lakh in 2019 to a few thousands in 2024. In January 2024, the Chinese embassy in Delhi had said that over 180,000 Chinese visas were issued to Indian citizens in 2023.\n\n• The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is the demarcation that separates Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory. India considers the LAC to be 3,488 km long, while the Chinese consider it to be only around 2,000 km. It is divided into three sectors: the eastern sector which spans Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, the middle sector in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, and the western sector in Ladakh.\n\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n\n📍A much-needed thaw\n\nUPSC Previous Year Mains Question Covering similar theme:\n\n📍‘China is using its economic relations and positive trade surplus as tools to develop potential military power status in Asia’, In the light of this statement, discuss its impact on India as her neighbour.

Nuclear fusion is what produces the energy in the Sun, or any other star.\n\nKey Points to Ponder:\n\n• What is Fusion?\n\n• Fusion vs Fission-Compare and contrast\n\n• China has made significant advancements in nuclear fusion technology. Discuss the potential implications of this breakthrough for global energy security and geopolitics.\n\n• What are the key scientific and technological challenges in achieving a commercially viable nuclear fusion reactor?\n\n• India is part of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project. Discuss India’s role in nuclear fusion research and its potential benefits for the country.\n\n• Analyse the economic and environmental feasibility of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source. Can it replace fossil fuels completely in the future?\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n• Fusion reactions require very high temperatures, hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius — higher than the temperatures in the Sun’s core.\n\n• At such high temperatures, matter exists only in the plasma state, in which atoms get split into positively and negatively charged particles. But such hot plasma cannot be handled by or contained in any material.\n\n• Within the reactor, this plasma needs to be kept suspended in a confined space, surrounded by very strong magnetic fields acting as\n\nwalls.\n\n• Charged particles respond to magnetic fields, and this property is used to guide the flow of plasma within an enclosed space, separated from any matter. This condition, necessary for facilitating fusion reactions, is extremely delicate and unstable, with the tiniest of changes in the magnetic field disturbing the whole set-up. Scientists have not been able to maintain these conditions for longer than a few seconds.\n\n• That is why the achievement of the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) reactor, located at the Institute of Plasma Physics in Anhui province in eastern China, is being seen as so important. It is a significant improvement on this reactor’s previous record of a little over 400 seconds achieved in 2023.\n\n• Real-life electricity-generating reactors would require this state to be maintained for hours, even days, at a stretch. Only then would continuous operations be possible, like current nuclear reactors which are based on fission technology.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• Fusion technology has been under development for more than 70 years but progress has been slow. Even the optimistic forecasts, at least till a few years ago, suggested a functional fusion reactor, producing electricity at a commercial scale, would not be realised before 2050.\n\nFor this reason, none of the global energy transition pathways for a net-zero world in 2050, or 2070, factor in the potential of fusion electricity. Each one of those pathways, incidentally, is heavily dependent on the success of several other uncertain technologies such as carbon sequestration and carbon removal, whose technical and economic viability remain under doubt.\n\n• The nuclear energy currently in use across the world comes from the fission process, in which the nucleus of a heavier element is split into those of lighter elements in a controlled manner.\n\n• In fusion, nuclei of two lighter elements are made to fuse together to form the nucleus of a heavier atom. A large amount of energy is released in both these processes, but substantially more in fusion than fission. For example, the fusion of two nuclei of a heavier isotope of hydrogen, called tritium, produces at least four times as much energy as the fission of a uranium atom which is the normal process of generating electricity in a nuclear reactor. Besides greater energy yield, fusion is also a carbon-free source of energy, and has negligible radiation risks.\n\n• In the last few years, fusion research has produced a string of breakthroughs. In December 2021, the United Kingdom-based JET laboratory set a new record in the amount of energy produced through fusion. It produced about 12 MW of electricity for five seconds, enough to cater to the demands of about 10,000 homes for that period of time.\n\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n\n📍The fusion energy breakthrough\n\nUPSC Previous Year Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n\n6.

After the launch, the new Isro chairperson Dr V Narayanan, recalled the greats like Vikram Sarabhai, Satish Dhawan, and APJ Abdul Kalam. “On behalf of the present generation of Isro leaders, I salute all the previous generation of leaders, the past and present employees, and our family members,” he said.\n\n• With the space agency targeting big-ticket missions such as the sample return mission from the moon, the mission to Venus, setting up an Indian space station, and sending a man to the moon, ISRO is working towards developing a heavier rocket called Next Generation Launch Vehicle.\n\n• NGLV will be capable of carrying up to 30,000 kg to low earth orbit. It will be 91 metres tall as compared to the 43 metres of LVM3. It will also have a re-usable first stage, which would be utilised 15 to 20 times, to make the launches more affordable.\n\n• NVS-02 is one of the five replacement satellites for the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, also referred to as NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation). The new generation satellites are heavier with longer mission life. They carry the indigenously developed atomic clock onboard. And, importantly, they have been enabled with a third frequency L1, which is mostly utilised by the US Global Positioning System (GPS). This will help in the utilisation of the NavIC signals more, with almost all devices including smaller ones such as personal trackers also carrying receivers for L1 band signals.\n\n• NavIC is a seven-satellite regional positioning system that can provide location data on the Indian mainland and up to 1,500 kilometres around. The NavIC satellites can provide position accuracy of up to 20 m under standard positioning service that is available to all and a restricted service for better accuracy available to customers.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• The space agency has its roots in the Indian National Committee for Space Research set up under the Department of Atomic Energy in 1962. The Indian Space Research Organisation that we know today was set up in 1969 — the same year that the United States sent men to the moon. A separate department of space was created only in 1972.\n\nThe space agency has since developed several rockets, becoming a reliable launch partner even for satellites from other countries. It has also carried out scientific missions such as the three Chandrayaan missions, which provide useful data not only to researchers from within the country but across the world.\n\n• Isro has so far developed at least six generations of launch vehicles, of which four remain in operation. The first two generations of launchers are no longer in use. There were three developmental flights and one operational flight of the four-stage, solid fuel vehicle SLV-3 that could carry 40 kg to low earth orbit. And, there were only four development flights of its augmented version that could carry 150 kg to low earth orbit.\n\n• It was the third generation PSLV that continues to be Isro’s workhorse launcher. The four-stage rocket with solid and liquid fuel-based engines is capable of carrying just under 2,000 kg to low earth orbit. There have been 62 flights of PSLV, including three development flights. Only two of the launches using PSLV have been unsuccessful.\n\n• Then came the GSLV, whose initial flights used cryogenic engines supplied by Russia. When the technology could not be transferred from Russia because of geopolitical reasons, India developed its own cryogenic engine. GSLV-F15 utilised for the 100th launch is a variation of this vehicle — and the eleventh flight using an indigenously developed cryogenic engine.\n\n• In the 100 launches so far, the space agency has placed in orbit 548 satellites weighing 120 tonnes in total. This includes 433 satellites weighing 23 tonnes that came from foreign nations. Isro has launched communication satellites, earth observation satellites, navigation satellites, and experimental satellites.\n\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n\n📍ISRO scores a century of missions with launch of navigation satellite\n\nUPSC Previous Year Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n\n7.

The Ministry of Mines also aims to auction over 100 critical mineral blocks by then.\n\n• A boost in exploration of critical minerals will provide potential investors with key data on reserves, which in turn will increase interest and participation in auctions. Till now, GSI has undertaken 368 exploration projects over the past three years, with 195 projects currently underway, and the mines ministry has auctioned off 24 critical mineral blocks.\n\n• Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the NCMM as a “major step towards self-reliance” in critical minerals. “The Union Cabinet’s decision on National Critical Mineral Mission will encourage India’s high-tech, clean energy, defence and other key industries,” he posted on X.\n\nDo You Know:\n\n• Critical minerals that are essential for economic development and national security, and the lack of availability of these minerals or the concentration of extraction or processing in a few geographical locations could potentially lead to “supply chain vulnerabilities and even disruption of supplies”. This is true for minerals such as lithium, graphite, cobalt, titanium, and rare earth elements, which are essential for the advancement of many sectors, including high-tech electronics, telecommunications, transport, and defence.\n\n• One of the definitions cited in the report characterises a mineral as critical when the risk of supply shortage and associated impact on the economy is (relatively) higher than other raw materials. This definition of a critical mineral was first adopted in the US and the subsequent legislation that resulted from the analysis, the report said. The European Union also carried out a similar exercise and categorised critical minerals on the basis of two prerequisites: supply risk and economic importance.\n\n• Under the mission, an additional Rs 5,600 crore is allocated to the NMET to finance risk coverage for foreign sourcing and to support exploration activities outside India.\n\n• The mines ministry seeks to amend the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act to enable the NMET to fund the proposed activities of the mission.\n\n• Announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in last year’s Union Budget, the mission aims to strengthen India’s critical minerals value chain by building a technological, regulatory, and financial ecosystem to ensure mineral availability from both domestic and foreign sources.\n\n• The mission is set to boost access to raw materials used across strategic sectors, from clean energy and electronics to defence and agriculture.\n\n• NCMM will receive Rs 1,000 crore from the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) and other R&D schemes, and Rs 2,600 crore in budgetary support.\n\n• In a meeting with officials from the Department of Economic Affairs in November, the mines ministry had proposed external funding for the NCMM through the World Bank’s Resilient and Inclusive Supply-Chain Enhancement (RISE) initiative.\n\n• As of February 2024, only $50 million have been pledged as initial contributions to the RISE initiative, with Japan contributing $25 million and the remaining from other countries, including Canada, Germany, Italy, the Republic of Korea, and the UK.\n\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\n\n📍Govt approves Rs 16,300-cr National Critical Minerals Mission\n\nUPSC Previous Year Prelims Question Covering similar theme:\n\n8.

    "authors": ["Samridhi Singh"],
    "raw_text": "The art of storytelling in food\n\nWhen asked about his knack for storytelling, Hussain offered a philosophical take: “You, me, and all of us are stories. We exist today, but tomorrow, only our stories will remain. Whether through books or movies, I have always loved storytelling.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWith Masalamandi, Hussain’s goal was to unravel the mysticism of Indian spices that shape age-old recipes. For him, food is an experience that extends beyond taste—it is about the stories behind every dish. “For food to be truly enjoyed, it must have a story. That’s why I write in a conversational style—it makes food history more engaging,” he said.\n\nTalking about the non-linearity of food history, he cites the ongoing debate over the origins of butter chicken as a prime example: “Families are fighting over who really invented the recipe, but I think it’s this story that made the dish popular. Similarly, chicken tikka masala became a national dish in the United Kingdom, with claims that a Pakistani chef in Glasgow created it.”\n\nFor the chef, food is a combination of logic and romance. His pop-ups and food walks are designed to immerse people in the joy of eating, encouraging them to appreciate the heritage behind every bite. “Cooking and eating, both are divine for me. I want people who come to eat with me to enjoy food as much as I do,” he said.\n\nFood divides as much as it unites\n\nHussain believes that while food is often seen as a unifier, it can also be divisive. “Food has always been political. The key is to respect what others eat, without attaching moral or ethical superiority to one cuisine over another,” he said, recalling the time he shared with a group he had taken on a food walk how “upper caste” Brahmins did not allow the so-called “lower caste” people to eat biscuits. According to him, “If you want to control a community, you control its food.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAnother layer of food politics, he noted, is gender discrimination in the kitchen. “For generations, women have cooked but rarely served themselves first. Our mothers and grandmothers made meals, yet men ate before them. Fortunately, I grew up in a household where this was not the norm. My mother had paralysis on one side, so my father took on a lot of the cooking. In fact, our entire family—my dad, my brother, and I—cooked together,” he said.\n\nHe also shared a telling anecdote about a female friend who, despite being a professional chef, was expected to cook at home after work—an expectation rarely placed on male chefs. Hussain’s children’s book The Carrot Soup explored such gender dynamics.\n\nA love for street food\n\nA connoisseur of Indian street food, Hussain urges people to embrace it without elitist biases.\n\n“There’s a misconception that all street food is unhygienic, yet it has inspired many fine-dining menus. The street food of a city reflects its culture. In Delhi, people love deep-fried chole bhature, taking their time to enjoy a leisurely Sunday meal. In contrast, Mumbai’s vada pav culture is fast-paced, mirroring the city’s hustle.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHussain said he admires cities like Lucknow, Kolkata, and Kochi for their dedication to preserving food traditions. “They are deeply passionate about their culinary heritage, which helps keep it alive. In Delhi, there is a growing effort to revive forgotten dishes, but much more can be done in preserving age old recipes. Masalamandi is my tribute to the diverse spice blends that define Indian cuisine—from biryani to chai and parathas. As the book says, ‘One spice can change an entire dish’.”\n\nMasterChef and culinary heroes\n\nSince appearing on MasterChef India, Hussain has been an avid fan of the show. As for his favourite judges, he said, “I admire both Chef Vikas and Chef Ranveer. Ranveer, in particular, shares my love for storytelling, so I feel a strong connection with him.”\n\nHe also paid homage to the legendary Imtiaz Qureshi, who passed away last year. It was he who pioneered the “dum pukht” style of slow cooking. “He was one of India’s greatest chefs. When I met him for the first time, I was completely starstruck. His reputation was so immense that anyone with the surname ‘Qureshi’ wanted to be associated with him,” Hussain said.\n\nWhen asked if he envisions owning a restaurant, Hussain said he prefers the idea of a cafe over fine dining. “I want people to come in, relax, and have fun.”\n\nHe shared his love for food saying, “As a kid, I wanted to be the fattest person on Earth. My Amma would serve me four meals within the first five hours of the day.” Today, his ideal indulgence is a quiet moment with a good cup of coffee. And through books, pop-ups and food walks, Hussain continues to share the magic of food, one story at a time.",

    "title": "How can feminisation of agriculture empower women?",
    "authors": ["IE Online"],
    "raw_text": "Women contribute around 63 per cent of the agricultural labour force in India, yet they lack access to key resources such as land ownership, finance, and advanced farming technologies. In this context, what does the feminisation of agriculture imply? Does this growing participation of women in agriculture – often driven by male outmigration – signify empowerment or does it reinforce gender disparity in land rights and decision-making power?\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhat does the female workforce participation rate say?\n\nThe female workforce participation rate in India reached its peak at 40.8 % in 2004-05 but has declined since. However, since 2017, the female labour force participation rate (FLPR) has seen a rising trend after years of decline. This increase has been more pronounced in the post-Covid years. The rural FLPR increased from 41.5% in 2022-23 to 47.6% in 2023-24, while the urban FLPR increased from 25.4% to 28% over the same time period.\n\nThis growth in FLPR could be attributed to the economic recovery following the easing of lockdown restrictions, which prompted many women who were previously not part of the labour force to seek employment. In addition, the sudden rise in FLPR in the last few years has also been linked to economic distress, which has forced more women to look for alternative income sources.\n\nThe feminisation of the Indian labour force, or the increase in the number of women participating in paid work, however, requires a deeper examination. The rise in FLPR is largely driven by the rise in self-employment among women, especially in agriculture. Analysis of state-wise census data indicates that in states where women’s workforce participation has increased, it has been primarily driven by the increase in women’s role in agriculture.\n\nThis trend highlights the lack of non-farm job opportunities for women, with most employment opportunities for rural women remaining confined to agriculture. This leads to feminisation of agriculture.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHow do we define feminisation of agriculture?\n\nEconomic literature interprets feminisation of agriculture in two ways. First, it refers to an increase in the proportion of farm related work undertaken by women, including their growing responsibilities as smallholder cultivators or casual agricultural wage workers.\n\nSecond, feminisation of agriculture can also imply an understanding of women’s control, ownership, and participation in agricultural resources and social processes. This includes women’s ownership of farmland, land rights, and decision-making power over crop selection and input usage, such as fertilizer application.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the feminisation of agriculture. The structural transformation of the Indian economy has led to a declining share of agriculture in GDP, with a shift from agriculture to the service sector. Additionally, rural distress has forced men to seek livelihood opportunities outside agriculture, often migrating to non-farm sectors.\n\nA number of other factors such as declining agricultural production and productivity, increasing cost of agricultural inputs, higher risks of crop damage due to climate change, limited employment opportunities, and the growing aspirations of newly literate youth in rural areas have further fueled male migration out of rural areas. As a result, women who are left behind take on multiple responsibilities, particularly in farm work.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nGender disparity in land ownership\n\nThe National Commission on Farmers’ 2005 report found that an increasing number of women are undertaking agricultural tasks such as taking care of the land and working as helpers. It is estimated that women undertake around 80% of India’s farm work and make up over 42% of the agricultural workforce. According to PLFS 2023-24 data, over three-quarters (76.95) of rural women are engaged in agriculture.\n\nDespite their significant contribution, female farmers remain largely invisible. The Agriculture Census of 2015-16 reported that while 73% of rural women workers are engaged in agriculture, only about 11.72% of the total operated area in the country is managed by female operational holders. This reflects the gender disparity in land ownership and control. Additionally, women’s landholdings are predominantly small and marginal, which can be attributed to longstanding patterns of unequal land distribution.\n\nIn India, women can acquire land through inheritance, gift, purchase, or government transfers. However, these systems are often skewed against their equal participation. For instance, women are more likely to be financially constrained than men to purchase land, making inheritance one of their major means of land ownership. Yet, social biases and norms make it difficult for women to inherit and control land.\n\nThe 2017 Uttar Pradesh land distribution programme can be highlighted here. Land titles were distributed to 331 landless households in two villages in Mirzapur district of the state – Sirsi and Karkad. 80 land titles were distributed in Sirsi, including eight to single women, and 251 land titles were distributed in Karkad, including 16 to single women. This means only 7% of the land titles went to single women. Studies have also underlined that land rights play an important role in women’s economic security and decision-making power.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTowards gender equity in agriculture\n\nIt has often been stated that women’s participation in paid work should not be confused with their empowerment. Women often face a “double burden of work” where they are forced to maintain a balance between paid employment and unpaid household and caregiving responsibilities. Similarly, women’s involvement in agriculture does not necessarily equate to empowerment.\n\nThe agrarian economy in India has been going through distress with a fall in agricultural incomes. Hence, women’s engagement in agriculture as cultivators may not be economically empowering, especially in the absence of viable non-farm employment opportunities. Moreover, research has also found that women usually lack significant decision-making powers in relation to use of fertilizers, household assets, alternative livelihood options, etc.\n\nThe feminisation of agriculture is often discussed alongside the feminisation of poverty or feminisation of agrarian distress. As male members of the family migrate in search of better opportunities, the women left behind are forced to move into agriculture – often seen as a less advantageous livelihood option.\n\nFurthermore, unequal land distribution and the lack of land ownership among female farmers make it difficult for them to access credit and other financial resources. This, in turn, limits their eligibility for some government schemes and benefits. Studies have also found that women are less likely to avail loans under schemes like the Kisan Credit Card and receive assistance from schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIn addition, the image of a farmer has always been associated with men. Unless this perception changes, female farmers will continue to be overlooked. Agriculture is not just about sowing and harvesting – it is also about investing in land and critical decision-making. Therefore, measures like placing women at the core of policies around agriculture, equal distribution of land, equal access to mechanization, and gender-responsive climate mitigation policies would help in achieving gender equity in agriculture and empower women.\n\nPost Read Questions\n\nHow does the increase in farm-related work undertaken by women contribute to the feminisation of agriculture?\n\nIn what ways does feminisation of agriculture relate to women’s control, ownership, and participation in agricultural resources?\n\nWhy is women’s ownership of farmland and decision-making power over agricultural resources crucial for their empowerment?\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhat policy measures can help achieve gender equity in agriculture?\n\n(Ritwika Patgiri is a doctoral candidate at the Faculty of Economics, South Asian University.)\n\nShare your thoughts and ideas on UPSC Special articles with ashiya.parveen@indianexpress.com.\n\nSubscribe to our UPSC newsletter and stay updated with the news cues from the past week.\n\nStory continues below this ad",

In the recent decade, for example, India’s installed renewable energy capacity has expanded by 165%, from 76.38 GW in 2014 to 203.1 GW in 2024.\n\n— India’s total non-fossil fuel capacity increased to 211.36 GW in 2024, from 186.46 GW in 2023. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.\n\n— India’s total electricity producing capacity has reached 452.69 GW, with renewable energy making up a sizable share of the overall power mix. As of October 2024, renewable energy-based power generation capacity totalled 203.18 GW, accounting for more than 46.3 percent of total installed capacity. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n— Solar power leads the way with 92.12 GW, a critical component in India’s efforts to capture its abundant sunlight. Wind power follows closely at 47.72 GW, owing to the huge potential of the country’s coastal and inland wind corridors. Hydroelectric power is another significant contributor, with large hydro projects generating 46.93 GW and minor hydro power contributing 5.07 GW, providing a dependable and sustainable source of energy from India’s rivers and waterways. Hence, statement 2 is correct.\n\n— Biopower, including biomass and biogas energy, contributes an additional 11.32 GW to the renewable energy portfolio. These bioenergy projects are critical for using agricultural waste and other organic materials to generate electricity, diversifying India’s clean energy sources.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is the correct answer.\n\n(Other Source: pib.gov.in)\n\nQUESTION 3\n\nWith reference to the Marine Fisheries Census, consider the following statements:\n\n1. The Marine Fisheries Census-2025 will be the fifth census conducted by the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) with the support of the Department of Fisheries, Govt. of India.\n\n2. It is conducted every second year.\n\n3. It includes inland and lake fisheries across the country.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 1 and 3 only\n\n(c) 2 and 3 only\n\n(d) 1, 2 and 3\n\nExplanation\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n— The Union Minister of Fisheries launched the 5th Marine Fisheries Census (2025) on the occasion of the World Fisheries Day 2024 celebration organised by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Govt. of India on November 21st in New Delhi. The census will be conducted by the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) with the support of the Department of Fisheries, Govt. of India. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\n\n— The census will include 1.2 million households from the coastal region. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.\n\n— Since 2005, ICAR-CMFRI has undertaken a marine fisheries census every five years. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.\n\nTherefore, option (a) is the correct answer.\n\n(Other Source: http://www.cmfri.org.in)\n\nQUESTION 4\n\nWhat are the sources of methane pollution?\n\n1. Organic waste in landfills\n\n2. Wetlands\n\n3. Rice fields\n\n4. Natural gas extraction and transportation operations\n\nSelect the correct answer using the codes given below:\n\n(a) 1, 2 and 3\n\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n\n(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4\n\n(d) 3 and 4 only\n\nExplanation\n\n— Tropical wetlands emit enormous amounts of methane, jeopardising global attempts to address climate change. According to research, rising temperatures and heavy rains are increasing methane emissions, which were previously underestimated in scientific models and national climate plans.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n— Methane, a strong greenhouse gas, traps heat 80 times more effectively than carbon dioxide during a 20-year period. Wetlands emit methane as soil bacteria break down carbon-rich plant matter, a process accelerated by rising temperatures and increased wetland area due to floods.\n\n— Methane in the waste sector is the fastest rising source of anthropogenic methane emissions, resulting mostly from the decomposition of organic waste in landfills, open dumps, and wastewater. It accounts for over 20% of anthropogenic methane emissions.\n\n— Methane waste is primarily generated by the decomposition of organic matter in oxygen-poor environments, most commonly found in landfills where decaying food scraps and other household waste break down under anaerobic conditions, producing methane gas as a byproduct; other significant sources include agricultural activities like livestock manure and rice cultivation, as well as natural gas extraction and transportation operations where leaks can release methane into the atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, option (c) is the correct answer.\n\n(Other Source: http://www.epa.gov)\n\nQUESTION 5\n\nWith reference to the Asiatic Lions, consider the following statements:\n\n1. Gujarat is the only home of the Asiatic Lions.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n2. They can hunt prey and protect their area as a group in pride.\n\n3. They are listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.\n\n4. They are classified as Critically endangered by the IUCN.\n\nHow many of the statements given above are correct?\n\n(a) Only one\n\n(b) Only two\n\n(c) Only three\n\n(d) All four\n\nExplanation\n\n— Asiatic Lions, which have a total population of 674 in Gujarat, coexist with humans through mutual adaptation, enforced legal protection, economic incentives, and government recompense for livestock, among other things.\n\n— Gujarat is the Asiatic Lions‘ only home, and calls to partially relocate them beyond the state, including Supreme Court decisions, have not been carried out. Conservationists have advocated for their relocation to nearby Madhya Pradesh to increase genetic interchange in the source population and to serve as a barrier against sickness and widespread infection. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n— These large cats may hunt prey and defend their territory as a group in pride. Females carry out the majority of the hunting and cub rearing activities. Hence, statement 2 is correct.\n\n— Lions can thrive in a variety of settings, including semi-arid deserts, dense shrubbery, dry woods, and floodplains, thanks to their extraordinary adaptability. They prefer open savannas because it allows them to more easily stalk their prey.\n\n— They are listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Hence, statement 3 is correct.\n\n— They are classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Hence, statement 4 is not correct.\n\nTherefore, option (c) is the correct answer.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nPrevious Daily Subject-Wise-Quiz\n\nDaily Subject-wise quiz — History, Culture, and Social Issues (Week 95)\n\nDaily subject-wise quiz — Polity and Governance (Week 95)\n\nDaily subject-wise quiz — Science and Technology (Week 95)\n\nDaily subject-wise quiz — Economy (Week 95)\n\nDaily subject-wise quiz — Environment and Geography (Week 94)\n\nDaily subject-wise quiz – International Relations (Week 94)\n\nSubscribe to our UPSC newsletter and stay updated with the news cues from the past week.",

    "title": "Unified Pension Scheme: All that matters for UPSC Exam",
    "authors": ["Khushboo Kumari"],
    "raw_text": "Story continues below this ad\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n1. The National Pension Scheme (NPS) replaced the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) on January 1, 2004. However, there have been persistent demands for a return to the OPS because for government employees, the NPS not only gave lower assured returns, it also implied employee contributions — which was not the case with the OPS. In 2023, the government constituted a committee chaired by then Finance Secretary (now Cabinet Secretary) T.V. Somanathan. Its recommendations led to the announcement of the UPS.\n\n2. Like the OPS, the UPS provides a guaranteed pension. It aims to give stability, dignity, and financial security to government employees after retirement, assuring their well-being and a secure future. More importantly, the UPS promises retirees a fixed pension, unlike the NPS. This was one of the major criticisms of the NPS.\n\nKey features of UPS:\n\ni. Assured Pension: The scheme provides an ‘Assured Pension’, which will be calculated at 50 per cent of the average basic pay drawn over the last 12 months by the employee, prior to superannuation or before their retirement, for a minimum qualifying service of 25 years. The pension will be proportionate for a lesser service period up to a minimum of 10 years of service.\n\nii. Assured minimum pension: The UPS guarantees a monthly pension of Rs 10,000 for superannuation after at least 10 years of service.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\niii. Assured family pension: If a retiree dies, their immediate family is entitled to 60% of the pension last taken by the retiree.\n\niv. Inflation indexation: Dearness relief for three types of pensions will be determined using the All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers, which is similar to serving workers.\n\nv. Lumpsum payment at superannuation: In addition to gratuity, lump-sum payment will be given at superannuation. This will be one-tenth of the monthly emolument (pay + DA) as on the date of superannuation for every completed six months of service. The payment will not reduce the quantum of assured pension.\n\nvi. Pension assurance for compulsorily retired employees: The UPS will also be available for employees compulsorily retired under fundamental rule 56 (j), which is not a penalty under central civil services rules, the notification said. However, assured payout will not be available in case of removal or dismissal from service or resignation of the employee. “In such cases, the Unified Pension Scheme option shall not apply,” it said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nvi. Contribution to the Scheme: There will be two funds under the UPS: one, an individual corpus with employee contribution and matching central government contribution; and two, a pool corpus with additional central government contribution.\n\nThe contribution of employees will be 10 per cent of (basic pay + Dearness Allowance (DA) with an equivalent matching central government contribution. Both will be credited to each employee’s individual corpus. Separately, the central government will provide an additional contribution of an estimated 8.5 per cent of (basic pay + DA) of all employees who have chosen UPS, to the pool corpus on an aggregate basis.\n\nvii. Choice of investment: The employees will be able to make investment choices for the individual corpus only, which would be regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). There will also be a ‘default pattern’ of investment defined by PFRDA. The investment decisions for the pool corpus will be taken solely by the central government.\n\nWhat was the OPS?\n\nPension to government employees at the Centre as well as states was fixed at 50 per cent of the last drawn basic pay. The attraction of the OPS lay in its promise of an assured or ‘defined’ benefit to the retiree. In addition, there was Dearness Relief — calculated as a percentage of the basic salary — to adjust for the increase in the cost of living. It was hence described as a ‘Defined Benefit Scheme’. There was no contribution from the employee.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTo illustrate, if a government employee’s basic monthly salary at the time of retirement was Rs 10,000, she would be assured of a pension of Rs 5,000. Also, like the salaries of government employees, the monthly payouts of pensioners also increased with hikes in dearness allowance or DA announced by the government for serving employees.\n\nBEYOND THE NUGGET: Why was NPS introduced?\n\n1. Under the NPS, which covers employees who joined service post January 2004, contributions are defined but benefits depend on the market.\n\n2. The main problem was that the pension liability remained unfunded — that is, there was no corpus specifically for pension, which would grow continuously and could be dipped into for payments. The Government of India budget provided for pensions every year; there was no clear plan on how to pay year after year in the future. The ‘pay-as-you-go’ scheme created inter-generational equity issues — meaning the present generation had to bear the continuously rising burden of pensioners.\n\n3. The OPS was also unsustainable. For one, pension liabilities would keep climbing since pensioners’ benefits increased every year; like salaries of existing employees, pensioners gained from indexation, or what is called ‘dearness relief’ (the same as dearness allowance for existing employees). And two, better health facilities would increase life expectancy, and increased longevity would mean extended payouts.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n4. Data show that over the last three decades, the pension liabilities of the Centre and states have jumped manifold. In 1990-91, the Centre’s pension bill was Rs 3,272 crore, and that of all states put together was Rs 3,131 crore. By 2020-21, the Centre’s pensions bill had jumped 58 times to Rs 1,90,886 crore; for states, it had shot up 125 times to Rs 3,86,001 crore.\n\n(Source: What is Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) 2024,Centre announces Unified Pension Scheme: How will UPS differ from OPS, NPS?, Why the Old Pension Scheme is both bad economics and bad politics)\n\nSubscribe to our UPSC newsletter.

According to Dr Jayanta Thakuria, Director – Internal Medicine and Rheumatology, Yatharth Super Speciality Hospitals, Faridabad, potassium helps relax blood vessels, excrete excess sodium through urine, and maintain proper fluid balance. A potassium-rich diet can help keep blood pressure under control, reduce the risk of heart disease, and improve nerve and muscle function.\n\nFoods like bananas, oranges, avocados, spinach, and sweet potatoes are excellent sources of potassium. She added that dairy products, legumes, and fish such as salmon also contribute to potassium intake, promoting cardiovascular and cellular health.\n\nWhy sodium-potassium balance matters\n\nThe sodium-potassium balance is regulated by the kidneys, and maintaining this equilibrium is essential for effective heart function, fluid regulation, and overall metabolic health. Dr Gupta highlights that too much sodium can raise blood pressure, but sufficient potassium intake helps manage this by improving vascular health and aiding in sodium excretion.\n\nA diet that is low in processed foods and high in natural sources of potassium can go a long way in maintaining this balance. As Dr Thakuria suggests, focusing on fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting salty, processed foods is key to avoiding hypertension and promoting heart health.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nRegular monitoring of sodium and potassium levels through diet and lifestyle choices can be a simple yet effective way to improve long-term health outcomes.",

    "authors": ["Lifestyle Desk"],
    "raw_text": "She continued, “I had taken my form back knowing that Miss Aishwarya Rai was entering the pageant and I’m like why bother? I mean, she’s beautiful and then she’s it for Miss India. Why bother contending with her and then coming back and saying, ‘I tried mama.’ But thank God for my mother. She always has explained to me, Karan, that there’s a thing in life called an upset… and you will never know if you can be an upset to someone or someone else can be that to you, unless you give it a shot. So, she said, ‘You come back to me having lost to the woman you think is beautiful, and that’s fine. Do go and be andhon mein kala raja, as they say.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nShe admitted that it was because of her mother that she went for it. She recalled, “I howled my lungs out because I had told my mother not to come for the pageant because I said, ‘Why do you want to come and embarrass yourself and me in front of so many people?’”\n\nWhen Karan asked if she thought she deserved to win, Sushmita replied, “Most definitely, without a thought.” She further explained, “I don’t compare myself to Aishwarya’s performance. I think she was fabulous on stage. I do believe in two things: One, that night, I was the best, and that’s why I deserved to win, not because I was better than someone else. It is only because I was at my best.”\n\nThis raises an important question: how does self-doubt impact performance in high-stakes competitions, and what strategies can help overcome it?\n\nSonal Khangarot, licensed rehabilitation counsellor and psychotherapist, The Answer Room, tells indianexpress.com, “Self-doubt can significantly hinder an individual’s performance in competitive environments. It often leads to increased anxiety, reduced concentration, and a decline in overall effectiveness. A study by Woodman and Hardy (2003) found a small but significant positive relationship between self-confidence and performance, indicating higher self-confidence correlates with better performance outcomes. Conversely, self doubt can erode this confidence, leading to suboptimal performance.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTo combat self doubt, Khangarot suggests individuals can employ several strategies:\n\nPositive Self Talk: Replacing negative thoughts with positive affirmations can enhance self-belief and reduce anxiety.\n\nVisualisation: Imagining successful outcomes can prepare the mind for actual performance, increasing confidence. Several sports personalities and actors across the globe use it.\n\n⁠Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Deep breathing and meditation can help maintain focus and manage irritational thoughts and worries.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nRole of external validation in shaping confidence\n\nExternal validation plays a crucial role in the development of self confidence, Khangarot notes, especially in fields like beauty pageants where appearance and perception are paramount. “Positive reinforcement from peers, mentors, and an audience can affirm an individual’s abilities and worth, thereby enhancing self-esteem,” she states",

    "title": "Jaggery: A sweet secret the world is finally catching onto",
    "authors": ["Rajyasree Sen"],
    "raw_text": "The many sources of jaggery\n\nJaggery is known as guda in Sanskrit and gur in Hindi. According to Acharya Charak, an influential figure in Ayurveda, the term guda originates from Gauda, an ancient name for Bengal, a major sugarcane-growing region. Ayurveda considers jaggery a “hot” food that becomes “colder” and less digestible as it is refined. Jaggery isn’t only derived from sugarcane. In South India, it’s made from palmyra palm juice, collected in pots smeared with lime to prevent fermentation, and then boiled until it thickens. In Bengal, wild date palm sap is set in coconut shell halves to solidify into patali gur.\n\nThe nolen gur I grew up seeing in Calcutta appears only in winter, as the date palm tree produces sap exclusively in cold temperatures, making jaggery available from November to February. The extracted sap is slowly cooked over a low flame until it becomes viscous. If stopped before crystallisation, it remains in liquid form as jhola gur, which can last six months in a sealed jar. Further reduction produces patali gur, a dark brown solid that melts in the mouth and can be preserved for over a year.\n\nJaggery through the ages\n\nJaggery has been produced since at least the 4th century BC. In Pundra Bardhan (now Bogra, Bengal), the Siuli community would climb date palm trees at night to extract sap, which was sold in markets. This trade made the region so synonymous with jaggery that Pundra Bardhan became known as Gour (gur). Jaggery also holds religious significance—Bengali sweet shops traditionally offer the first batch of nolen gur mishti or sandesh to Goddess Kali.\n\nIndia produces over 70 per cent of the world’s jaggery, but it cannot claim sole credit for its popularity. Much of this comes from sugarcane jaggery, a crop introduced to the Indian subcontinent around 6000 BC via the Malayan Peninsula and Burma. Jaggery is one of the main flavouring agents in many curries and salads from these countries. And jaggery made from sugarcane and called gud is highly popular in Pakistan. In some parts of Pakistan, the jaggery is created from the Palmyrah palm, coconut palm, or date palm, and the thickened liquid is sold in moulds.\n\nJaggery in global cuisine\n\nIf we drizzle jhola gur on luchis, across the border, in Pakistan’s Punjab region, they prepare jaggery rice with coconut and almonds. In the colder parts of Pakistan, jaggery chai is so common that it is almost impossible to find chai with normal sugar.\n\nIn South Asia, you can find panela in Colombia and much of the Caribbean. Jaggery is called kokuto in Japan and rapadura in Brazil, and many Thai, Malaysian, and Burmese dishes use crumbled jaggery as a sweetening agent.\n\nI would strongly recommend you to trot over to your locality’s Bengali sweet shop and taste some jaggery rosogolla or gurer sandesh or gurer payesh. The distinctive caramel taste is something refined sugar simply cannot replicate.",

A group of 18 researchers at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) at the University of Chicago has indeed maintained such a device since 1947. The bad news is that the Doomsday Clock’s hands have just inched closer to catastrophe. In fact, with 89 seconds to midnight, the BAS has asserted that “continuing on the current path is a form of madness”.\n\nThe Doomsday Clock was created by a group of scientists who had previously worked on the Manhattan Project — the American R&D programme led by J Robert Oppenheimer during World War II, which culminated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They recognised the growing dangers of nuclear weapons in a new era of geopolitical tensions and originally set the clock at seven minutes to midnight. However, since 2007, the BAS began factoring in the deadly risks posed by climate change. It is no surprise, then, that until 2025, the closest the clock had ever been set to midnight — just two minutes away — was in 1953, when the US and the Soviet Union tested thermonuclear weapons, and again in 2018 due to “a breakdown in the international order”. The furthest the Clock has been set was 17 minutes to midnight, in 1991, following the Soviet Union’s collapse and an arms reduction treaty with the US.",

The Dow ended the day down 0.31 per cent, while the S&P 500 fell by 0.47 per cent.\n\nThe Fed noted that economic activity was expanding at a “solid pace”, and unemployment had “stabilised at a low level”, while inflation remained “somewhat elevated”. Recent data points to the strength of the US labour market. In December 2024, 2,56,000 jobs were added, significantly outstripping expectations. The unemployment rate edged downwards to 4.1 per cent, underlining the strength of the growth momentum. However, data from the US Labour Department showed that inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, rose to 2.9 per cent in December, up marginally from 2.7 per cent in November, indicating that the last mile of disinflation is proving to be difficult. Sticky inflation coupled with a strong labour market suggests less scope for greater policy easing. In his comments, Fed chair Jerome Powell noted that the central bank would have to see “real progress on inflation or some weakness in the labour market before we consider making adjustments”.",

    "authors": ["Subimal Bhattacharjee"],
    "raw_text": "Story continues below this ad\n\nGenerative AI is not just a technological frontier; it is a geopolitical battleground. The ability to develop and control foundational models confers significant economic and strategic advantages. Countries that lead in AI innovation can shape global standards, influence international norms, and gain a competitive edge in industries ranging from defence to healthcare. The US-China rivalry in AI is a case in point. The US has long been the dominant force in AI research and development, thanks to its world-class universities, tech giants, and venture-capital ecosystem. However, China’s concerted efforts to become a global AI leader by 2030 have narrowed the gap. DeepSeek’s success is emblematic of China’s broader strategy to achieve self-reliance in critical technologies and reduce its dependence on Western imports.\n\nFor other nations, this rivalry presents both challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, the concentration of AI expertise and resources in a few countries risks creating a new form of technological colonialism, where smaller nations become dependent on foreign AI systems. On the other hand, the democratisation of AI tools and open-source initiatives offers a pathway for countries to build their own capabilities and assert their sovereignty in the digital age.\n\nIndia, with its thriving tech industry and vast pool of engineering talent, is uniquely positioned to become a major player in the generative AI space. However, despite its strengths, India lags behind in developing foundational models. Most Indian AI startups and enterprises rely on foreign LLMs, which limit their ability to innovate and cater to local needs. The effort to purchase 10,000 graphic processing units (GPU) is yet to gather steam to be able to support the modest AI projects being planned around optimal healthcare delivery, improved crop yields, and enhanced access to personalised education.\n\nInvesting in foundational models is not just a matter of national pride; it is an economic imperative. Generative AI has the potential to add trillions of dollars to the global economy, and India cannot afford to be a passive consumer in this transformative wave. Moreover, India’s diverse linguistic landscape presents a compelling use case for localised AI models. With over 22 officially recognised languages and hundreds of dialects, India requires AI systems that can understand and generate content in multiple languages. Foundational models tailored to Indian languages would not only address domestic needs but also create export opportunities in other multilingual regions.\n\nTo achieve this vision, India must adopt a multi-pronged strategy. First, the government should increase funding for AI research and development, particularly in academia and public-private partnerships. Initiatives like the National AI Strategy and the establishment of AI research centres are steps in the right direction, but more ambitious efforts are needed. Second, India must invest in infrastructure to support AI innovation. This includes high-performance computing resources, cloud infrastructure, and data-sharing frameworks that enable researchers and startups to train large-scale models. Collaboration with global tech leaders and participation in international AI consortia is crucial to accelerate progress. Third, India must foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in AI. This requires not only technical skills but also a mindset that embraces experimentation and risk-taking. Initiatives like AI hackathons, startup incubators, and industry-academia collaborations can nurture the next generation of AI leaders. Fourth, Indian tech giants should start the LLM pursuit as India has access to better GPUs and interconnects compared to China. The iCET sets India on the path of comprehensive tech cooperation with the US.\n\nDeepSeek’s rise is a testament to the transformative power of generative AI and the shifting dynamics in the global AI landscape although it still remains to be seen what is the fairness in all its responses, particularly when it comes to prompts about China and its political systems. It has stated that its R1 model is open source and has laid out its reasoning in a paper in Github. So, there is the scope to test and validate that model and see if such models can be repeated at reasonable costs, factoring in concerns about bias, privacy, and misuse.",

    "authors": ["Editorial"],
    "raw_text": "The suffering of the people who lost their dear ones in the tragedy on Maha Kumbh at Prayagraj on Wednesday is heartrending. The lives of at least 30 devotees were snuffed out and more than 60 were injured in a pre-dawn stampede on Mauni Amavasya, the biggest bathing day of the mela. There are fears that the toll could rise. Officials have blamed the incident on people breaking barricades in the rush for a dip in the holy waters on the auspicious occasion. A wave of pilgrims heading towards the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati, reportedly crashed into those on their way back after the ritual bath. In the chaos, a section of the crowd jumped queues, broke columns and trampled over devotees resting near the Sangam. The UP government delayed declaring the death toll until Wednesday evening. It has ordered an inquiry. That should throw more light on what went wrong. One thing, though, is clear: Crowd management at Kumbh, which UP governments have, with reason, been always proud of, needs a harder look. The UP government had, by all accounts, made elaborate plans for the smooth conduct of the Kumbh. Its publicity drives played a big role in the surge of visitors. Attendance almost always swells beyond the estimates drawn up by administrators. These events test even the most well-drawn-out plan. Large crowds are known to be susceptible to panic-inducing triggers. Administrators and law enforcers must, therefore, be constantly on the vigil for any sign of anxiety.\n\nMore than 10 crore people took the ritual bath Wednesday. Attendance of this magnitude tests the capacities of administrators. From declaring the Maha Kumbh area in Prayagraj as no-vehicle and no-VIP zone to preparing a plan to avoid any security issues, the UP government put in place elaborate arrangements for the Mauni Amavasya. It has drawn criticism for giving precedence to VIPs, photo ops and public relations. The Kumbh Mela has always been a place where politicians and celebrities rub shoulders with the mendicants and common devotees. Social media amplifies each pilgrim’s progress. Clearly, authorities must act decisively and lose no time in ensuring that the crowd keeps moving – emotions such as fear, anxiety, excitement and anger can spread when people linger in one spot in a high-density area.",

    "title": "After DeepSeek: For India, time for the AI leap",
    "authors": ["B Ravindran", "Krishnan Narayanan"],
    "raw_text": "Chinese engineers looking to develop foundation models/LLMs faced significant challenges in acquiring large quantities and the latest versions of Nvidia’s GPUs. Given these constraints, they cleverly combined several known AI engineering techniques, while making some unique contributions as well, to radically improve efficiencies and lower costs of AI-model training and inferencing.\n\nFor instance, DeepSeek claims that it uniquely leveraged “reinforcement learning” techniques to create an AI model with advanced reasoning behaviours like self-verification and complex chains of thought, autonomously. It uses a “mixture of experts” technique to assign different parts of a training task to specialised units or “experts” within the model, ensuring that only the most relevant sections are used at any given time. To make the system even more efficient, DeepSeek uses other optimisation techniques to quickly find and process information without using much memory, and also predict two words at a time instead of one. All these AI engineering methods make the system faster and more resource-efficient while still handling complex problems. The lower cost encourages more startups to use DeepSeek in their real-world applications.\n\nSeveral questions arise with respect to DeepSeek’s implications for India. Why didn’t we create this here? Is there an opportunity to create newer models in the future? Will our developers use models like this and benefit from them?\n\nLet us start with the implications for developing AI applications first. The most significant aspects of DeepSeek models are their cost-effectiveness and open access. These models achieve performance that matches existing models, like GPT-4, but at a fraction of the cost. The API access is roughly one-tenth to one-twentieth the price of global AI models. This price reduction is a game changer for the Indian AI industry. It means that high-quality language models become much more accessible and affordable for a wide range of applications and users.\n\nDeepSeek is open source, which is very important, as it allows users to download the models and run them on their own hardware if they have the capacity. We are already seeing others create local installations of DeepSeek models — even without GPUs. This means Indian startups don’t need to rely on servers located in China and can create their own version of the DeepSeek service, much like Perplexity has already done.\n\nSecond is the issue of AI research. India has a strong AI talent pool, but it’s mostly focused on building applications on top of existing AI systems. While India can use existing LLMs very well for this purpose, we need to focus on fundamental research in order to create our own cutting-edge AI foundation models. There is a strong need for increased AI research funding and a shift in our approach to AI development. To start with, we expect that multiple efforts will be undertaken in India (in universities and companies) where existing models of DeepSeek/Meta’s Llama will be installed locally, and fine-tuned with India-specific or domain-specific data. Remember, DeepSeek did not happen overnight — it involved the efforts of hundreds of researchers/engineers in under two years.\n\nThe lower costs of training and inference mean that researchers can perform many more experiments. Andrej Karpathy, one of the engineers involved with DeepSeek, has suggested establishing a global “RL-gym” to create a wide range of RL environments to understand how LLMs think and make decisions. This may spur research towards developing AGI. At the same time, let us not forget that there are several other areas of AI to research — predictive AI and physical AI, for example.\n\nThere are only a few efforts in India to create our own LLMs. We must use the DeepSeek moment to catalyse multiple and competing mission-mode projects to develop our own foundation models. Besides the government, private sector companies and philanthropists can also fund some of these AI grand challenges. The IndiaAI Mission’s GPU cluster will come in handy for these projects.\n\nMulti-disciplinary teams should be put in place. The projects require expertise in AI frameworks like PyTorch, advanced attention mechanisms, efficient model training techniques and reinforcement learning. Engineers need skills in optimising AI performance using low-precision computing and specialised processing methods. Teams should also have hardware expertise in GPU acceleration, distributed computing and high-speed networking.\n\nIndia has the talent. It has the resolve. The time for collective AI action is now.",

    "title": "For the Yamuna to flow — consensus is needed, not political slugfests",
    "authors": ["Shailaja Chandra"],
    "raw_text": "Story continues below this ad\n\nFirst, the facts. The water coming from Haryana is the only source of drinking water in Delhi and anxieties about its potability affect citizens, particularly when accountability is opaque. The supply of drinking water becomes a crisis in Delhi every few months. The capital receives its drinking water from several key inlets that all originate in Haryana, chief among them the Wazirabad Barrage, where raw water from the Yamuna is received in Delhi. The flow at Wazirabad depends on the releases from Haryana’s Hathni Kund Barrage.\n\nDuring the lean seasons, water levels often drop, leading to ammonia contamination and water shortages in Delhi. The city’s drinking water depends on these inlets. Treatment at Delhi’s Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Okhlam Haiderpur and Bawana treatment plants rests entirely on the availability of water from Haryana. When the water supply is depleted, what goes into the treatment plants becomes untreatable, leading to shutdowns, which have a cascading effect on water supply. There is frenzy over securing tankers and collecting water, and this is the only subject of conversation in affected neighbourhoods.\n\nThe solution lies in joint inspection of water released by Haryana — both in terms of quality and quantity. There is also the need for an independent monitoring system to be established, and retribution in case the water released is short of the agreed norm or contains pollutants that render it untreatable for drinking. In view of the extreme distrust between governments and the matter going to the apex court every year, it is time a more functional and transparent system is put in place.\n\nThe second issue is of pollutants, apart from ammonia. This is largely due to sewage flowing in the stormwater drains, the discharge of industrial effluent mainly from unlicensed household industries, and solid waste dumping. During the period 2018 to 2021, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) set up the Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) to monitor the abatement of pollution in the river. Five reports were given to the NGT, which pinpointed the roles and responsibilities of 16 stakeholders who contribute substantially to pollution. During the life of the committee, each of the stakeholders — which included the Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Development Authority, and the governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh — committed to a slew of measures. These have not been undertaken.\n\nThe Najafgarh, Supplementary and Shahdara drains are significant contributors to the pollution in the Yamuna, as they carry substantial amounts of untreated sewage and industrial waste from various regions, including parts of Haryana and UP. To mitigate this, both states had committed to establishing sewage treatment plants (STPs). In Gurugram, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority had found that approximately 80 million litres of untreated sewage was discharged daily into stormwater drains leading to the Najafgarh drain. However, as of the latest reports, Haryana too has not fully implemented its commitments.\n\nLong before 2018, Delhi had started work on an “interceptor project” to trap and treat sewage before it is discharged into the Yamuna. Despite notable improvements, which are on record, the project has not achieved its intended outcomes and the river continues to suffer from significant pollution due to incomplete sewer connections in unauthorised colonies, operational inefficiencies in some STPs, and the continuous inflow of untreated industrial waste.\n\nThe third issue is environmental flow. The National Mission for Clean Ganga under the Ministry of Jal Shakti had asked for a report from the National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) in Roorkee. The NIH study was aimed at assessing the flow of water necessary to maintain ecological balance and support essential riverine functions. The NIH concluded that the current water withdrawals upstream significantly reduce the river’s flow through Delhi, exacerbating pollution levels and harming aquatic life. It recommended regulating water releases from upstream barrages, especially during lean seasons, to maintain a minimum environmental flow.\n\nThe YMC, too, had pointed out that Delhi suffers from severely reduced flow, especially during the nine non-monsoon months, and this was leading to high contamination and ecological degradation. It recommended revisiting the 1994 water-sharing agreement between the basin states of Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and UP to ensure a more equitable distribution of water.\n\nThe studies by the YMC and NIH underscore the critical importance of maintaining adequate environmental flow in the Yamuna to ensure its ecological health and the well-being of communities that depend on it. But it is unlikely that Haryana and other states will pay heed to this unless it is mandated either by the central government after arriving at a consensus or a court of law. Given the size and complexity of the issues plaguing the Yamuna, it is time that people at the helm of affairs — politicians, bureaucrats or engineers — address major problems. The solutions are in black and white. What is missing is the will to reach a consensus and to deal with the problem in an equitable and just manner.\n\nUnless that happens, neither promises nor manifestos have any meaning. The sooner citizens realise what is happening, the better.",

    "raw_text": "Last year’s budget allocated Rs 1.12 lakh crore to education, a 13 per cent increase from the previous year. However, experts argue that additional investments are necessary to bridge skill gaps, expand digital learning, and improve access to quality education.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHere’s a look at how academics want this year’s budget to be:\n\nProfessor Ramgopal Rao, Vice Chancellor of BITS Pilani\n\nTo stem brain drain, which sees over 8 lakh students studying abroad at a cost of nearly $70 billion annually, professor Ramgopal Rao, vice-chancellor of Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS Pilani), stresses the need for making Indian institutions globally competitive. He calls for increased funding to establish overseas campuses, greater autonomy for universities, and outcome-based funding models tied to research output. “Strengthening faculty quality and research ecosystems through substantial grants and philanthropic incentives will help bridge the gap between elite and Tier-2 colleges, creating a dynamic higher education system that retains top talent,” he added.\n\nProfessor Ram Kumar Kakani, Director of IIM Raipur\n\nProfessor Ram Kumar Kakani, Director of IIM Raipur, reiterated that India currently spends 4.6 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on education and has urged the government to move towards the historical target of 6 per cent as recommended by the Kothari Commission (1964-66). He also emphasised the need for equitable financial support for Indian Institute of Managements (IIMs), which currently lack direct government backing compared to Indian Institute of Technology (IITs). “Increased funding for global collaborations, relaxed regulations for foreign partnerships, and greater investment in STAM research and micro-credential courses would enhance India’s innovation landscape and create globally competitive talent,” he said.\n\nPrateek Maheshwari, co-founder of ed-tech platform Physicswallah\n\nPrateek Maheshwari, co-founder of ed-tech platform Physicswallah, calls for a 100 per cent GST exemption on educational expenses for students from Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Low-Income Group (LIG) families. He highlighted that the current 18 per cent GST on higher education and online learning is a major burden, especially when countries like Switzerland offer free education and China taxes it at just 6 per cent. “High tax rates contradict India’s goal of 50 per cent GER in higher education by 2035, creating access barriers. To make education more affordable, rationalising student loan interest rates and providing interest-free loans for disadvantaged students is essential,” he added.\n\nProfessor Debashis Chatterjee, Director of IIM Kozhikode\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nProfessor Debashis Chatterjee, director of IIM Kozhikode, stressed the importance of increased funding for Startup India and the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM). He advocated for a stronger focus on Industry 4.0 skills such as AI, ML, and blockchain to align India’s workforce with global trends. Additionally, he highlighted the need for expanded scholarships and subsidised education loans to improve access to quality education. “Strengthening the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) and providing special financial packages for Tier 2 and Tier 3 institutions would help bridge the urban-rural divide,” he said.\n\nTr. Chaitanya Dev Singh, national president of Round Table India\n\nSchool infrastructure and digital education are also key priorities, according to Tr. Chaitanya Dev Singh, national president of Round Table India (an association focussing on building classrooms and providing essential facilities to underprivileged schools). He pointed out that the Rs 37,500 crore allocated for Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan and Rs 73,008 crore for the Department of School Education in 2024 have already contributed to improving education quality. However, he urged further investment to accelerate technology integration, bridge the digital divide, and align with NEP 2020 goals, positioning India as a global education leader.\n\nMeenu Kanwar, principal of Amity International School, Mayur Vihar\n\nMeenu Kanwar, principal of Amity International School, Mayur Vihar, emphasised that school infrastructure development should be prioritised through lease-based models, reduced GST on affiliation services, and sustainability incentives.\n\nDr Ruchi Arora of BIMTECH\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nDr Ruchi Arora of BIMTECH underscored the need for stronger public-private partnerships to address India’s vast educational potential, with 580 million youth but only 51.25 per cent employable graduates. She advocated for digital learning expansion, skill-based education, and financial support for international students to establish India as a global education hub.\n\nDr PR Sodani, president of IIHMR University\n\nHealth management education is another critical focus area, according to Dr P R Sodani, president of IIHMR University, Jaipur. Sodani has called for strategic investments in skill-based learning, digital capabilities, and global partnerships to strengthen the sector. He stressed the need for greater collaboration between industry, academia, and start-ups to accelerate digital innovation and improve health outcomes. A digital health incentive plan could support the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, enhance data security, implement electronic health records, and upskill technical resources, Sodani said. Targeted investments in holistic health services would position India as a leader in high-quality health management education, he remarked.\n\nPiyush Kumar, Regional Director, South Asia, Canada and Latin America, IDP Education\n\nPiyush Kumar, the regional director of South Asia, Canada and Latin America (LATAM), IDP Education, hopes that the government announces measures to reduce the financial burden that makes foreign education more affordable. Lowering remittance fees, making education loans cheaper and expanding scholarship programmes to support deserving and underprivileged students would help more meritorious students build promising careers.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nA well-calibrated budget increase for education and research will drive innovation, empower youth, and solidify India’s position as a global knowledge leader. As the nation looks ahead to the 2025-26 budget, progressive policy measures and increased investments will be key to transforming India’s education landscape into an inclusive, future-ready, and globally competitive learning ecosystem.",

    "raw_text": "Many students struggle with the decision of whether to take a year off before taking the NEET exam. Making the difficult choice to take a drop year can have a tremendous impact on a student’s emotional and academic life.\n\nThere are a few resources available on the internet where free sample papers can be found for NEET UG including the NEET official website, SATHEE website and more.\n\nNEET UG 2025: It is not simple to balance coaching, school and NEET UG preparation, but you may succeed in all three with smart time management. Set priorities for your work, adhere to a set timetable, make good use of coaching sessions, and adopt healthy routines.\n\nNEET UG 2025: Students who select biology, chemistry and physics as their main disciplines position themselves for a focused and well-rounded path to become future medical professionals.\n\nNEET UG preparation is a difficult process that frequently calls for hours of concentrated study time each day. Long study periods without breaks, however, might result in mental exhaustion, burnout, and a drop in output. Students can improve their focus, rejuvenate their minds, and recharge by taking well-planned study breaks.\n\nRead More | Tip on how to maximize study breaks in order to improve focus and memory\n\nThere is a 102 per cent increase in the number of medical colleges — from 387 before 2014 to 780 in 2024. Similarly, the number of MBBS seats has registered an increase of 130 per cent — from 51,348 before 2014 to 1,18,137 as of now, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare stated in Rajya Sabha in December.\n\nIn the NEET UG, the concept clarity in physics, chemistry and biology is more important than rote learning for success. Students taking NEET UG in 2025 should focus on clearing concepts rather than prioritising memorising.\n\nNTA does not repeat word-to-word; rather, it uses similar patterns frequently. They often follow common topics, concepts, or types of questions from earlier years. For instance, if some particular formula or concept was very relevant in an old paper, then again its question would most probably turn up.\n\nThe official website of NEET UG is neet.nta.nic.in and nta.ac.in. For the 2024 exam, the NEET UG application form, information bulletin, syllabus and exam pattern were available at neet.ntaonline.in, exams.nta.ac.in/NEET/ and nta.ac.in.\n\nFrom the latest trends, here is the distribution of the marks that can be sought after to get an MBBS seat:\n\nGovernment Medical Colleges (AIQ)\n\nGeneral Category: 650+OBC Category: 630–650SC/ST Category: 500–550\n\nGovernment Medical Colleges (State Quota)\n\nGeneral Category: 600–650OBC Category: 580–620SC/ST Category: 450–550Private and Deemed Universities\n\nFor MBBS seats, in private colleges, the marks are relatively on the lower side.\n\nGeneral Category: 400–550Reserved Categories: 300–400NRI/Management Quota Seats:\n\nFor these seats, marks may be 250 to 400. The marks depend on the colleges.\n\nOn a notice issued on January 14, NTA had asked the aspirants to update Aadhaar details and integrate their APAAR ID. APAAR ID (previously called the Academic Bank of Credits or ABC ID) is designed to digitally store a student’s academic credits and ensure a comprehensive record of their academic journey. However, last week, NTA has confirmed that APAAR ID is not mandatory for NEET application. Aspirants can continue to register for NEET UG using other available means details of which shall be available in the information bulletin soon.\n\nNEET UG 2025 paper will now have 180 compulsory questions — 45 questions each in physics and chemistry and 90 in biology. Candidates will have to attempt the paper in 180 minutes.\n\nThe optional questions in NEET UG 2025 Section B has been discontinued. Candidates taking the NEET UG in 2025 will not get any optional questions and extra time introduced during Covid and exam will now revert to the pre-covid format.\n\nThe optional section was introduced as a temporary measure to accommodate the challenges posed during Covid pandemic and has been in practice till 2024. NEET UG 2025 paper will now have 180 compulsory questions — 45 questions each in physics and chemistry and 90 in biology. Candidates will have to attempt the paper in 180 minutes.\n\nNo, NEET UG 2025 will be held in pen and paper mode. Logistics was a big reason why the government preferred to maintain the status quo. While an online exam would limit the number of hands the question paper passes through, the NTA cannot afford to repeat the embarrassing experience of the first Central University Entrance Test (CUET), which saw technical glitches (on account of ill-prepared test centres) forcing cancellation of examination at the last minute on multiple days.",

Disruptions exist everywhere, but you gotta respect @sama for the genAI revolution.”\n\nA third individual commented, “India won’t be able to compete unless we have good research and development labs and teams. Nor do I see much of investments in that area. Until that it aint gonna happen!”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSam Altman addressed the misunderstanding in 2023, explaining that his words were taken out of context. He clarified that the actual discussion was about whether a company could take on an AI giant with just 10 million dollars in coffers.\n\nWith DeepSeek’s rapid expansion beyond China, India is stepping up its game in the AI space. Acknowledging the global boom in artificial intelligence, the Indian government is now focused on creating its own large language model (LLM)—one designed specifically for India’s diverse languages, culture, and unique needs. IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently shared the country’s vision for a homegrown AI system that avoids the biases found in many foreign models, ensuring a more inclusive and locally relevant approach.",

    "raw_text": "But history soon repeats itself—this time, over a sandwich.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAfter taking a bite, Sally realises something is missing. The solution?

    "raw_text": "This is the Catchup on 3 Things by The Indian Express and I'm Flora Swain.\n\nToday is the 28th of January and here are the headlines.\n\nModi Targets Raw Material Exports\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India will no longer rely on exporting raw materials to be processed abroad and sold back as finished goods. Speaking at Odisha’s Utkarsh Odisha conclave, Modi emphasized that India’s economic growth must focus on innovation and quality manufacturing. He also highlighted recent Coldplay concerts in Mumbai and Ahmedabad as proof of the potential for live events to boost the economy, underscoring the shift towards a self-sufficient, value-added production ecosystem.\n\nKejriwal Demands Ban on Loan Waivers for Billionaires\n\nAhead of the Delhi Assembly elections, AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal urged PM Modi to introduce a nationwide law banning loan waivers for billionaires. He criticized the government for waiving loans of the wealthy while ordinary citizens bear high taxes. Kejriwal suggested that ending these waivers could lower income tax, GST rates, and remove taxes on essential goods. He called the practice a scandal and demanded an end to what he called \"unfair financial relief for the rich.\"\n\nSri Lankan Navy Fires on Indian Fishermen\n\nFive Indian fishermen were injured when the Sri Lankan Navy opened fire near Delft Island on Tuesday. Two of the fishermen sustained serious injuries and were hospitalized in Jaffna, while three others suffered minor injuries. India lodged a strong protest with the Sri Lankan Acting High Commissioner in New Delhi, and the Indian High Commission in Colombo also raised the issue with the Sri Lankan government. The remaining fishermen were detained by the Sri Lankan Navy.\n\nMaharashtra Civic Elections Delayed Again\n\nMaharashtra’s long-awaited civic elections will be delayed further as the Supreme Court scheduled the next hearing on petitions regarding OBC reservations for February 25. The delay has disappointed political parties and aspirants preparing for the polls. The Pune Municipal Corporation has been under an administrator since the previous body’s term ended in 2022. Parties are now facing additional uncertainty as the civic polls remain stalled due to ongoing legal challenges over reservations.\n\nTrump Hints at Modi's White House Visit\n\nUS President Donald Trump confirmed that PM Narendra Modi is likely to visit the White House in February following a phone conversation between the two leaders. Trump described the relationship between the US and India as “very good” and said they discussed various issues, including illegal immigration. While India has not officially confirmed the visit, Trump said Modi would “do what’s right” regarding immigration matters, signaling potential discussions during the upcoming visit.\n\nThis was the Catch Up on 3 Things by the Indian Express.",

    "title": "Why Wall Street did not punish Apple and how the tech giant can benefit the most from China’s DeepSeek",
    "authors": ["Anuj Bhatia"],
    "raw_text": "It just shows that Apple’s hidebound, old-school approach may have saved the company—something no one anticipated when everyone criticised the iPhone maker for not taking risks and being way behind the curve in investing in generative AI. Apple has a reputation for being cautious, and although it did launch the Apple Intelligence suite of AI features.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nBut fears that Chinese startup DeepSeek’s open-source approach can flip the narrative and change the trajectory of AI beyond the questions of training costs and capital investment levels, could actually help Apple. So far, AI has been perceived through the lens of how Silicon Valley wanted to set the narrative—i.e., scaling up AI is only possible by investing more. In reality, however, each of the major American tech companies were biting their own tails, promising that once AI was fully developed the profits would be distributed within the closed circle. After all, the biggest buyers of AI technology were themselves. DeepSeek has challenged this status quo, which is why everyone is rushing back to the drawing board and looking for alternative models.\n\nFor Apple, though, the benefit is that it has always been in the consumer space and has never focused on the enterprise space like Microsoft. Additionally, its short-term profits are not tied to generative AI. DeepSeek’s approach to AI will take AI to the masses, and Apple’s strategy has also been the same, as it is so strong with its hardware and has the backing of the iPhones and Macs.\n\nWhile it is unlikely, Apple could leverage DeepSeek’s open-source AI models, relying heavily on on-device capabilities while keeping the privacy layer intact. Apple has worked with OpenAI and Google for the current set of Apple Intelligence features. But DeepSeek’s new approach is more efficient, less capital-intensive, and easier to implement. This means Apple could quickly build new features.\n\nApple’s business model is very clear: it sells the iPhone and makes money from both hardware and services. By focusing on integrating AI models into its hardware rather than building its own, Apple opens the door to charge for Apple Intelligence features if it chooses and roll them out as part of a new service. It’s up to Apple—it can decide whether to charge consumers for Apple Intelligence features or treat AI as a secondary feature. The truth is that DeepSeek’s AI approach may positively impact how Apple sees and builds Apple Intelligence. It also shows that Apple doesn’t need to rush; it can do things at its own pace.",

    "title": "Identity theft: How to protect yourself from impersonation",
    "authors": ["Ankita Deshkar"],
    "raw_text": "According to the UK-based Sumsub Identity Fraud Report 2023, India, along with Bangladesh and Pakistan, is among the top ten countries in the Asia-Pacific region most affected by identity fraud committed using deepfake technology.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhat is identity theft?\n\nIdentity theft is when cybercriminals steal personal information—such as passwords, ID numbers, and financial details—from unassuming people and commit fraudulent activities posing as them. These stolen credentials can be misused for taking loans, making unauthorised online purchases, accessing sensitive medical and financial records, and committing crimes in the victim’s name.\n\n“The history of identity theft dates back centuries, but the digital age has transformed cybercrime. From telephone deception to sophisticated synthetic identities, criminals are now almost untraceable. With deepfake technology and AI-driven scams, identity theft is becoming harder to detect,” said Sagar Vishnoi, co-founder of Future Shift Labs and an AI & cybersecurity expert.\n\nCommon types of identity theft\n\nAccording to Vishnoi, identity theft scams take various forms:\n\nFinancial identity theft: Criminals steal bank details or credit card information to withdraw money, make purchases, or open accounts fraudulently.\n\nMedical identity theft: Fraudsters use stolen personal information, like health insurance numbers, to obtain medical services or file fake claims.\n\nCriminal identity theft: Scammers commit crimes using a victim’s identity, leading to wrongful arrests or legal troubles.\n\nSynthetic identity theft: Criminals create fake identities using a combination of real and fabricated information. This can be tricky because the victim’s information might not be fully compromised, but the fraud is still happening under a ‘fake’ version of their identity.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nChild identity theft: Since children don’t use their identities for banking, fraud often remains undetected for years, until the child becomes an adult and tries to use their information for the first time, like applying for a bank account or student loan.\n\nOnline identity theft: Cybercriminals steal information from social media, emails, or websites to commit fraud.\n\nBiometric, tax, and passport identity theft: Criminals steal unique physical traits (like fingerprints) used to verify identity. It can happen through hacks or malware. The problem is that once stolen, biometric data can’t be changed like passwords, making it a tough thing to recover from.\n\nTax identity theft is when someone uses personal info (PAN card details) to file a fake tax return and steal a refund. Passport identity theft happens when criminals steal or misuse passport details to pretend to be the victim, often for travel or illegal activity.\n\nPhishing and imposter scams: Scammers trick people into sharing personal data through fake emails, calls, or messages, often impersonating banks or tech companies.\n\nHow do cybercriminals operate?\n\n“Cybercriminals are using increasingly sophisticated tactics to steal personal data,” said Vishnoi. According to him, phishing remains one of the most common methods, where scammers send emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, urging victims to share sensitive details like Aadhaar numbers or banking credentials.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“Social media is also a major hotspot for identity theft. Cybercriminals frequently create fake profiles using stolen personal information and exploit these identities for financial fraud or blackmail,” he said.\n\nVishnoi also noted that in India, a common tactic involves fraudsters posing as bank employees, claiming an account needs Aadhar linking to avoid card blockage—tricking victims into revealing sensitive information. The dark web is increasingly used to steal personal data and fuel larger scams.\n\nHow can you spot identity theft scams?\n\nUnexpected requests for personal info: If you get a call, email, or text asking for sensitive details like your bank info out of the blue, be cautious.\n\nSuspicious links or attachments: If you see strange links or attachments in a message or an email, don’t click on them. They could be phishing attempts.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nUrgent or threatening messages: Scammers love to create panic, claiming your account will be locked or your card blocked unless you act fast. Double-check with the bank before responding.\n\nUnusual activity on your accounts: If you spot unfamiliar charges or activity on your bank statements or credit reports, don’t ignore them. Report it right away.\n\nToo-good-to-be-true offers: If someone offers you something that seems too good to be true (like a free vacation or big cash prize) but asks for personal details to claim it, it’s probably a scam.\n\nSigns your identity may have been compromised:\n\nUnauthorised transactions on bank accounts\n\nUnfamiliar charges on credit cards\n\nReceiving bills for services you didn’t use\n\nContacted by debt collectors for debts you don’t owe\n\nUnexplained changes in your credit score\n\nNotifications about accounts you didn’t open\n\nSteps to take immediately:\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nContact your bank/financial institutions: Report potential fraud and freeze or close affected accounts.\n\nPlace a fraud alert with major credit bureaus (TransUnion CIBIL, Experian, Equifax, CRIF High Mark) to prevent further fraud.\n\nFile a First Information Report (FIR) with your local police for documentation and investigation.\n\nProtecting yourself from identity theft: How to stay safe online\n\nTo safeguard your personal information, especially on social media, adjust privacy settings to restrict access and set profiles to private. Use strong, unique passwords for each account and consider a password manager for secure storage. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added protection. Be cautious with friend requests and links from unknown sources, as they may be phishing attempts. Regularly monitor your bank statements and credit reports for suspicious activity. Limiting the personal details you share can also help reduce the risk of identity theft.\n\nThe Safe Side: As the world evolves, the digital landscape does too, bringing new opportunities—and new risks. Scammers are becoming more sophisticated, exploiting vulnerabilities to their advantage. In our special feature series, we delve into the latest cybercrime trends and provide practical tips to help you stay informed, secure, and vigilant online.",

Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw emphasized the importance of securing India’s mineral future as the nation seeks to strengthen its economic infrastructure and ensure sustainability in key industries.\n\nThe Joint Committee of Parliament has adopted its report on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, despite criticism from Opposition MPs about the rushed process and lack of sufficient review time. The bill, which proposes changes to the management of Waqf properties, has sparked disagreement within the committee. Opposition leaders have raised concerns about the short notice to review the 655-page report, accusing the government of undermining parliamentary procedures in the final stages of the bill's consideration.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) achieved a major milestone by completing its 100th satellite launch, placing the NVS-02 navigational satellite in orbit.

    "title": "The Catch Up: 31 January",
    "raw_text": "The Indian government has launched the National Critical Minerals Mission, a 16,300 crore rupees initiative to reduce country’s dependency on foreign mineral imports on Wednesday. The mission focuses on domestic exploration, mining, and processing of essential minerals to support technological growth and industrial needs. Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw emphasized the importance of securing India’s mineral future as the nation seeks to strengthen its economic infrastructure and ensure sustainability in key industries.\n\nMeanwhile, the Joint Committee of Parliament has adopted its report on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, despite criticism from Opposition MPs about the rushed process and lack of sufficient review time. The bill, which proposes changes to the management of Waqf properties, has sparked disagreement within the committee. Opposition leaders have raised concerns about the short notice to review the 655-page report, accusing the government of undermining parliamentary procedures in the final stages of the bill's consideration.\n\nArvind Kejriwal on Thursday dared leaders from BJP and Congress to drink the water of Yamuna river after the Election Commission responded to the Aam Aadmi Party chief amid the ongoing row over Yamuna, asking the former Delhi chief minister not to mix the issue of increased ammonia in Yamuna with his allegation of river poisoning. The EC gave Kejriwal another chance to explain his charges against the Haryana government. The EC further asked Kejriwal to provide factual evidence with specific and pointed response to type, quantity, nature and manner of poisoning of Yamuna.\n\nOn the global front, an American Airlines passenger plane and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter collided and crashed near Reagan Washington National Airport on Thursday. The passenger jet, carrying 64 people, was on approach to the airport when the incident occurred. Initial reports indicate that at least 18 bodies have been recovered from the river, with search and rescue operations ongoing amid challenging cold weather conditions. Emergency responders, numbering over 300, are actively engaged in the recovery efforts, which have been complicated by the frigid temperatures. The airport has suspended all operations until at least 11 a.m. EST on Thursday. While the exact number of casualties remains unclear, officials have confirmed that fatalities are expected.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Donald Trump signed his first piece of legislation, the Laken Riley Act, during his second term, which allows for the pre-trial detention of undocumented immigrants accused of crimes such as theft, burglary, and assault. Additionally, a group of Republican Senators introduced the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2025 in the US Senate, aiming to restrict birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants and non-immigrants on temporary visas. Trump’s administration also rescinded a controversial memo that temporarily froze federal spending on loans and grants just two days after its issuance, leading to widespread confusion and legal challenges.\n\nThis was the Catch Up on 3 Things by the Indian Express",

IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw confirmed the development today. To support this, 10 companies, including Yotta, Jio Platforms, and Tata Communications, will supply 18,693 GPUs. Yotta alone will provide nearly half of these chips, totaling 9,216 units, to help build the AI model.\n\nArvind Kejriwal has challenged BJP and Congress leaders to drink Yamuna river water after the Election Commission intervened in his claims about river poisoning. The EC had asked Kejriwal to clarify his accusations of ammonia pollution and provide factual evidence of the alleged poisoning. The commission is also seeking more specific details about the nature, quantity, and source of contamination, with Kejriwal facing scrutiny for his allegations.\n\nA Canadian report dismissed claims of foreign involvement in the disinformation campaign surrounding the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Nijjar. Relations between India and Canada soured after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being behind Nijjar's murder in June 2023. India strongly rejected the accusations, calling them politically motivated, which led to the expulsion of diplomats from both countries, further damaging bilateral ties.\n\nA political controversy erupted in Goa after the BJP government ordered South Goa SP Sunita Sawant to relinquish her charge. The Congress party accused the transfer of being politically motivated due to Sawant’s inquiry about Bajrang Dal leaders. The government has temporarily assigned Tikam Singh Verma, SP of the anti-narcotics cell, to oversee South Goa. Sawant was appointed in February 2024, and an official transfer order has yet to be issued.\n\nA tragic collision occurred between an American Airlines plane and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington D.C. on Wednesday night. The plane, carrying 64 people, collided with the helicopter, which had three soldiers aboard. President Trump was briefed on the accident, and emergency operations were launched. All flights were suspended, and rescue teams, including firefighters, were engaged in operations on the Potomac River. 18 fatalities were confirmed, though details remain unclear.\n\nThis was the Catch Up on 3 Things by the Indian Express.",

Even when India hosted the 50-over World Cup in 2023, there was no opening ceremony. There was only an official photoshoot and a joint press conference with captains. For the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, none of it happened. So there is no such event this time as well,” sources in the know told The Indian Express.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIt is understood that a photoshoot is also ruled out this time because England and Australia are scheduled to reach Pakistan only on February 18 or 19. It is one of the reasons why the event is unlikely to see any practice matches, which is the norm for ICC events.\n\nAustralia, who are without a win in the tournament since 2009, are currently in Sri Lanka and the tour ends only on February 14, following which they will take a short break before landing in Pakistan. Similarly, England after their India tour ends on February 12, are in line for a short break.\n\nWith the tournament just a couple of weeks away, all eyes are already on Pakistan as to whether they will get renovation of their stadiums completed in time or not.\n\nIndia won’t be travelling to Pakistan and will be playing their group matches in Dubai.",

    "authors": ["Pratyush Raj"],
    "raw_text": "However, the day was all about Virat Kohli.\n\nThe fans came in huge numbers to watch him play his first Ranji Trophy match in more than 12 years. There was almost a stampede at Gate 16 of the stadium. Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, the adjoining road, was sealed from the morning as it fell on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s route to Raj Ghat, where he was to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary.\n\nTo control the crowd, Delhi Police resorted to a lathicharge and the Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) was forced to open Gate 18 and another stand to let the crowd enter the venue.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIf it was a frenzied atmosphere outside the stadium, on the 22 yards, the Railways batters were feeling the heat. There was high intensity in the first half of the day with the ever-energetic Kohli pumping the crowd to get behind the home team. And the crowd listened to his music. The Railways batters looked overwhelmed. When left-arm seamer Sidhhant Sharma pinned Anchit Yadav (7) in the second over, the half-filled stadia erupted.\n\nThe noise kept getting louder with every wicket as Siddhant, Navdeep Saini and Money Grewal rattled Railways’ top order.\n\nAmidst all this, Yadav kept his cool. He started with a nice flick to square-leg and then showed his class with a perfect straight drive. He found support in veteran Karn Sharma and the duo forged a century stand for the sixth wicket. Karn fell immediately after reaching his half-century with a six off Saini’s bouncer, but the bowler had the last laugh when Delhi’s short-ball ploy finally worked.\n\nYadav, who hails from Kanpur and started his first-class career for Uttar Pradesh before moving to Railways, admitted the response of the crowd overwhelmed his teammates, who were not used to playing in such an atmosphere.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“Generally, when we play Ranji Trophy, there is not much of a crowd. It was all because of Virat Kohli. It feels good when a big player comes and plays Ranji Trophy,” Yadav said.\n\nHe credited his IPL experience for not succumbing to the crowd pressure. “I was with Sunrisers Hyderabad and have seen the atmosphere in the IPL. It was quite similar.\n\n“When I was playing for UP, Suresh Raina played a match at Green Park in Kanpur. There were big crowds for that match as well and the Kanpur crowd was as loud as we have seen in Delhi,” he said.\n\nThe Railways ‘keeper missed out on a well-deserved century as he went for the glory shot and was caught in the deep off Sumit Mathur’s bowling. His knock was studded with 10 fours and a six.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIt was pretty unusual for Yadav, who was intent on keeping strike but the adrenaline rush to reach his third century of the season got the better of him.\n\n“I won’t say I was tired or rushed. Instead, I was confident that I could clear the boundary but I couldn’t,” he said.\n\nYadav, who was a regular for India A till last year, has fallen down the pecking order with the likes of Dhruv Jurel and Kumar Kushagra going past him. In five outings for India A, the 28-year-old has a couple of valuable knocks. He scored 76 against South Africa A at Bloemfontein and an unbeaten 71 against Bangladesh at Cox’s Bazar.\n\n“I don’t know why I was dropped from the India A side. It is up to the selectors. My job is to keep scoring runs. I have done well in T20s and List A as well,” he said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhen asked whether leaving Uttar Pradesh had cost him a chance to play for India, he smiled and said: “I have never felt that way. But everyone tells me that.”\n\nSaini bends back\n\nFor Delhi, pacers Saini (3/62), Siddhant (2/35) and Grewal (2/49) made the most of the new ball and helpful conditions in the first session. Left-arm spinner Sumit Mathur (3/20) took the most important wicket of Yadav and wrapped up the tail.\n\nIt was Saini who bowled with a lot of heart in the afternoon session when it looked like the pitch had turned into a road. He broke the crucial partnership between Karn Sharma and Yadav in the 53rd over.\n\n“The captain and I spoke about the short-ball strategy and Virat bhai also had a word with Badoni. There wasn’t much happening from the pitch and we had tried to be patient. But after that, we resorted to bouncers. We knew we could concede a few runs but a wicket-taking opportunity would also arise,” Saini said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHe is one of the few Delhi cricketers who have played with Kohli for India and at Royal Challengers Bengaluru. He explained why the team had extra motivation for this match, calling it the Kohli effect.\n\n“With him around, the other players’ energy goes up automatically. Over the last two days, our practice sessions were just different. Because his energy was so high, our energy was also high.”\n\n“Kohli’s effort – whether he is batting, fielding or in the gym – is always 110%. Seeing him in training, you are compelled to follow that. It spills over to the ground as well.\n\n“The intensity of the practice sessions on both days was very high. He was very involved on the field and was talking to all the bowlers and our captain. It was the same during practice.”\n\nStory continues below this ad",

Rahul Sharma pinned Dhull for 32 and the crowd erupted in joy.\n\nKohli was greeted with a huge roar after Dhull’s dismissal. The crowd at the Arun Jaitley Stadium was waiting for this moment for the past three days. The administrators were busy having one meeting after another to get everything right and the broadcasters had built up the match for this moment.\n\nAll eyes were on Kohli and he opened his account on the fifth ball with a gentle tap at the short cover.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nKohli did not look comfortable even for one moment, however. Sangwan may have gotten the wicket but Kunal Yadav troubled Kohli the most with the movement and bounce.\n\nIn the third ball of the 27th over of Delhi’s innings, Kohli’s outside edge was beaten twice by Yadav. It was the sixth stump line, which has been Kohli’s weakness. The Railways’ seamer exploited it again. The next ball, the ball was pitched around the fifth stump line and Kohli was beaten again. Yadav kept luring Kohli into playing a drive.\n\nIn the following over, Sangwan attacked Kohli’s stumps. The former Indian captain, who was batting inside the crease looked frustrated with the lack of pace from Sangwan. After watching a couple of balls, he walked down and played a powerful straight drive down the ground for a boundary. It was more of an angry shot from Kohli rather than a shot of authority. From the stands, though, it elicited more chants of ‘Kohli, Kohli!’\n\nIt was the next ball which Sangwan probably will never forget. It was on full length, just outside the off-stump. Kohli, who was batting outside the crease, looked to dominate Sangwan and went for a drive. His attempted shot opened up a gap between bat and pad and the ball went through it.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSangwan celebrated like he should. It was a memorable wicket for the boy from Najafgarh. The celebration also deserted the crowd at Kotla, who like Kohli started their slow walk outside the stadium.",

    "authors": ["Vinayakk Mohanarangan"],
    "raw_text": "The league — responsible for turning around the fortunes of the Indian hockey team — was restarted in December after a seven-year hiatus. And while its relaunch was welcomed in the hockey world, the decision to hold it in just one city had a mixed response.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nRourkela, though hockey-crazy, offers limited recreation options. For the players, it meant that their lives for the last five weeks were largely restricted to the magnificent Birsa Munda Stadium, the adjoining training pitch and gym, and the on-site hotel.\n\nAnd so, they found ways to unwind and take their minds off hockey.\n\nIn a social media post, former World Cup and Olympic champion from Belgium, Victor Wegnez, listed 10 different things he had done during his time in Rourkela. Among these was how his teammates at the Soorma Hockey Club had adopted stray puppies near the team hotel.\n\n“There’s a litter of puppies on the way from the hotel to the stadium, and the team has adopted this lot — taking turns to feed the litter. Sardar Singh (former India captain and Soorma mentor) and Wegnez, in particular, have gone above and beyond to look after them,” Kunaal Majgaonkar, who heads Soorma’s media team, said. “Sardar has got them little beds, clothes and food. There isn’t much to do around Rourkela and these puppies have become the best possible distraction for the team,” he said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWegnez, in one of his posts, thanked Sardar for adopting one of the puppies. “My little boy will grow in a lovely family thanks to Sardar,” he wrote in the post, which also included a video of Australia’s Jeremy Hayward trying out panipuri — and seemingly finding it not too spicy.\n\nThe players at Soorma also watched the Border Gavaskar Trophy together. “The boys were following the India-Australia Tests, and there were a few Europeans who had no idea about the game. They were constantly asking the Indian players about the rules, and they found it very intriguing. So, on their off-day, they all got together and played cricket,” Majgaonkar said.\n\nA video of a cricket match on Soorma’s Instagram shows captain Harmanpreet Singh teasing a teammate about his bowling, and the team’s head coach Jeroen Baart from the Netherlands trying to play a hook shot, among other such moments.\n\nCricket is also a big part of the off-day activities for Hyderabad Toofans, one of the teams that will compete in Friday’s semifinals, team director Siddharth Pandey said. “Every 10 days, we looked at doing something fun,” Pandey said. “Our first was a Christmas party where we asked the players to play some games. On December 31st night, we had a New Year’s party where we had games again. On January 6, we booked a cricket ground and took the whole team there to play a match,” he said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThey took it a step further a week later. After the Toofans played the Kalinga Lancers, the team was given three days off. “So, the foreign players went to play golf in Bengaluru. Some of the Indians went to Puri, to the Jagannath temple, while some went to Ranchi; I went bowling,” Pandey said.\n\nToofans’ defender Arthur de Sloover even tried his hand at making rotis. “The Belgians have immersed themselves. Not just Arthur in our team, but even Victor and Vincent Vanasch from Soorma HC. They have got along so well with everyone here,” Pandey said.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Dragons, which has also reached the semifinals, made the short trip to Ranchi — the venue for women’s HIL, where the men’s franchises played a match each — and took time off to visit the hockey academy in Simdega. The district is home to some of India’s top women players, including Sangita Kumari, Beauty Dungdung and captain Salima Tete.\n\nA B Subbaiah, former India goalkeeper and Kalinga Lancers team manager, said Hockey India could consider adding more venues from next season so that players can unwind in larger cities.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“We played some cricket and football outside the hotel as team-building activities. The city is small, so options were limited,” Subbaiah told The Indian Express. “There are two malls where we occasionally went out with Indian players, but bigger cities offer more activities like bowling or golf. Holding the league in one place for such a long time felt a bit tiresome.”\n\nSubbaiah said while the players tried to make the best out of the situation, playing cards by the pool at the team hotel, video games and so on, there was feedback that the league could be condensed a bit because there were too many breaks between matches.\n\nWhile playing a five-week league in Rourkela may not have been ideal, as Wegnez put it, some of the overseas players lived “the Indian experience 100 per cent”.",

    "authors": ["Lalith Kalidas"],
    "raw_text": "Pandya achieved a remarkable milestone during the previous T20I in Rajkot that one may not immediately associate with the 31-year-old. With four overs and two wickets in the game, Pandya finished one delivery short of 300 overs in the format after surpassing Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s 298.5 T20I overs, the previous best among Indians. Only 14 bowlers from Full-Member nations have bowled more deliveries in T20Is.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nPlayer Mat Overs Wkts BBI Econ SR Arshdeep Singh 62 214.4 98 4/9 8.27 13.1 Yuzvendra Chahal 80 294 96 6/25 8.19 18.3 Hardik Pandya 112 299.5 94 4/16 8.17 19.1 Bhuvneshwar Kumar 87 298.3 90 5/4 6.96 19.9 Jasprit Bumrah 70 251.3 89 3/7 6.27 16.9\n\nIt may not be a standout factor at the outset. However, it is indeed significant given Pandya’s frequent run-ins with injuries, a dodgy back, and the sheer expectations from him with the bat in the middle-order.\n\nOn a broader context, Pandya has bowled as many deliveries as the legendary Lasith Malinga in T20Is and produced nearly as many wickets as the Sri Lankan slingman had in his time (107).\n\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nOne of only three Indian players to have played at least 100 T20Is, Pandya’s 94 scalps rank only behind the sensational Arshdeep Singh and Yuzvendra Chahal for the Men in Blue.\n\nHardik Pandya Span Inns Econ Wickets Bowl Ave SR Dot% Boundary% Powerplay 2016-2019 10 10.5 0 – – 26.3 23.61 2021-2025 38 8.31 10 44.9 32.4 48.4 20.06 Middle Overs 2016-2019 38 8.22 26 29.11 21.2 36.2 15.57 2021-2025 51 7.95 33 26.03 19.6 37.9 15.27 Death Overs 2016-2019 14 7.24 12 7.75 6.4 38.9 14.28 2021-2025 19 7.95 13 12.84 9.6 33.3 12.69\n\nA circle of progress between two tantalising 20th overs at the T20 World Cup, in 2016 and 2024, best sums up Pandya’s rise as a dependable bowler. A one-run win over Bangladesh in Bengaluru in his 14th T20I was more of MS Dhoni’s inimitable presence behind the stumps, with the gloves and the brains. When India pulled off a Barbados heist over South Africa last year, Pandya not only eked out a win in the final over with the ball but also snapped the country’s ICC title drought.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSplitting the nine years in half, witnesses Pandya’s rise as a dependable seamer who has also recently taken over as India’s second paceman in the XI with an added reliance on spin at home.\n\nOver 85 per cent (80) of his career T20I wickets have resulted in wins, while only about 65 per cent (1148) of his 1750 runs have fashioned victories. While Pandya’s bowling has been pinned largely to the middle-overs, he has grown to ace the role in the last four years.\n\nMiddleovers since 2021 (pacers) Innings Wickets SR Eco Hardik Pandya (IND) 51 33 19.6 7.95 Haris Rauf (PAK) 56 27 19.1 8.13 Craig Young (IRE) 29 27 12.1 7.64 Luke Jongwe (ZIM) 43 25 17.3 7.83 Romario Shepherd (WI) 43 25 18.4 8.96 Mustafizur Rahman (BAN) 58 24 22.5 6.66\n\nBetween 2016 and 2019 (no game in 2020 due to Covid), Pandya picked up 26 wickets between overs 7-16, striking every 21.2 deliveries while conceding 8.22 runs per over. The stocks have improved to 33 wickets since 2021, with a 19.6 SR and 7.95 economy.\n\nHis Maturing prowess also saw him tasked more often with the new ball, manning Powerplay overs alongside Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh at the death, since the last few seasons.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIn 10 matches where he bowled in the Powerplay in the first four years of his career, Pandya could not collect a single wicket while leaking 10.5 rpo. He has since taken the responsibility in the first-six in 38 games, producing 10 wickets while holding a respectable 8.31 in the slam-bang age. Pandya has also reaped more wickets at the death (overs 17-20) in the second half of his running career, with a significant reduction in boundary-conceding deliveries (Bnd % of just 12.69).\n\nPandya’s repertoire with hit-the-deck deliveries and off-cutters ranks him as the most effective seamer in the middle-overs in all T20Is since 2021. His 33 wickets are well ahead of the likes of Haris Rauf (27), Mustafizur Rahman (24) and Anrich Nortje (20) to name a few.\n\nWith his refined bowling profile, Pandya has deftly refurbished his T20I utilities, the products of which will remain integral to India’s T20 world title defence at home in 13 months.",

Virat Kohli. We can take care of our class attendance later but watching Kohli for free, you can’t skip it.”\n\nOnce you stepped out of Gate No 5, near the petrol pump, half a dozen boys from Burari calling themselves the “Northern Boys” were buying Virat’s jersey outside the stadium. Ganesh, who calls himself the captain of the pack, said, “Ranji kaun dekhta hai (who watches Ranji). We are here for Kohli.”\n\nThe spectators started to line up outside Gate No 16 and 17 of the Arun Jaitley Stadium from 7 am. The Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) had thrown the game open for free entry to the public for two gates for the Gautam Gambhir stand — but at 9 am, the state association was forced to open Gate No 18 after fans broke the barricades.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nOnce the Gautam Gambhir stand was full, the association had to open the Bishan Singh Bedi alcove, which got filled in 10 minutes.\n\nThe approximate crowd for the opening day is around 15,000, and was adding by the minute, even as Delhi chose to bowl first.\n\nOutside Gate 16, the crowd was involved in pushing and heckling the security guards and Delhi Police. A couple with a five-year-old kid fell down, while entering the game and got injured. A police bike was damaged. One of the police constables needed a bandage on the leg.\n\nThe crowd erupted once the superstar started doing warm-ups and the stadium was buzzing with chants of ‘Kohli, Kohli’.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThere were a few boos as well after Delhi captain Ayush Badoni opted to field.

After the incident, a dozen police commandos entered the stadium and were guarding the stand.",

He was commissioned into the Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter wing in June 2006, and became Group Captain in March 2024. Shukla has 2,000 hours of flight experience across various aircraft, including the Su-30 MKI, MiG-21, MiG-29, Jaguar, Hawk, Dornier, and An-32.\n\nAfter receiving a call from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2019, Shukla underwent rigorous training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Moscow, Russia. In February 2024, the pilot was picked as the prime astronaut for ISRO’s maiden human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, scheduled for 2026.\n\nWhat is the Axion Mission 4?\n\nThe mission, which is slated for “no earlier than Spring of 2025”, involves taking four astronauts — Shukla, Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland, Tibor Kapu from Hungary, Peggy Whitson from the US — to the ISS. The crew will travel in SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The astronauts will stay at the station for 14 days.\n\nDuring the press conference, Shukla said, “While we are in the station for two weeks, we will be performing several scientific missions and conducting several outreach events. I know that right now an entire team is working to ensure that every minute we spend on the station is scheduled for activities to optimise our time there.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTo prepare for the mission, the astronauts underwent training at the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and Japan Manned Space Systems Corporation (JAMSS). The initial training was carried out at ESA’s European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany. There the astronauts learned about the communication systems, and emergency response procedures and conducted research activities inside the Columbus module of the ISS.\n\nColumbus is a European module of ISS that has a versatile laboratory for interdisciplinary research in microgravity. India’s space agency along with the Department of Biotechnology have been working on developing space biology experiments that may be carried out on-board Axiom-4.\n\nAfterwards, the crew underwent training at JAXA’s Tsukuba Space Center in Japan, where they were trained on the operations of the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo. The training included in-depth knowledge about the module’s capability.",

    "raw_text": "What explains the delay and who is included under the quota? We explain.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nFirst, what is the SEBC quota?\n\nUnder the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2024, the SEBC quota was introduced to provide 10% reservation in public jobs and higher education for the Maratha community. The Marathas form almost a third of the state’s population, with the demand for reservation being a longstanding political issue.\n\nIn 2023, under the leadership of Maratha activist Manoj Jarange Patil, protests for Marathas to be recognised as a backward community gathered momentum. The state government agreed to their demand in January 2024 and the SEBC Act was enacted the following month.\n\nIt came into effect in the 2024-25 academic year, making this the first batch of students admitted under the category. Candidates taking admission on seats reserved under this quota were to submit their CVCs, ideally at the time of admission. The session has commenced and students have been admitted.\n\nNotably, the SEBC Act has been challenged in the Bombay High Court. On April 16, 2024, the Court clarified that till further orders, any applications for admissions to educational institutions or jobs at government authorities taking benefit of the impugned Act would be subject to further orders in those proceedings.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhat is the procedure for applying for CVC under the SEBC Act?\n\nA Caste Certificate is a document that confirms that a person belongs to the said community, while a Caste Validity Certificate is proof of holding an authentic caste certificate. This helps ensure that the individual is not pretending to belong to any backward community to avail a job, admission or other benefits. Thus, a CVC must be submitted when an individual from any reserved category is applying for a government job or admission to professional courses such as engineering and medicine.\n\nIn Maharashtra, CVCs can be obtained online or offline. The applicant must submit relevant documents showing proof of identity, address, caste validity documents, affidavits, etc.\n\nThe SEBC Act stated that provisions of certain existing Acts and rules governing Maharashtra’s Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and some other groups shall “mutatis mutandis” (with necessary changes) apply for issuance of Caste Certificate and Validity Certificate for Marathas.\n\nWhy was the CVC submission deadline extended?\n\nProcedural issues have been flagged in obtaining the CVC for SEBC because this is a newly implemented reservation category. While some individuals have faced problems collating all documents, the administrative systems are also adjusting to dealing with CVC applications coming under a new segment. Many also complained that the process took too long to complete even after submitting the required documents.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThis is the second extension, as the original deadline was eased due to complaints. However, as the January deadline approached, it was further extended for another three months since a significant number of candidates had not been able to submit their CVCs.\n\nAccording to the Government Resolution issued earlier this month, candidates admitted under the SEBC quota have until April 2025 to submit the CVCs. Failing to do so, their admission will be cancelled.",

    "title": "Sundarbans are resilient in face of natural, manmade stress: A new study highlights how",
    "authors": ["Yashee"],
    "raw_text": "First, what are mangroves, and why are they important?\n\nMangroves are the only kind of trees that can thrive in salty water near the sea. The Sunderbans, for example, are located in the delta formed by the Ganga, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna rivers off the coast of Bengal, which means they have access to fresh water while also being washed by the tidal salty water of the Bay of Bengal.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAccording to a Global Mangrove Alliance report on the Sundarbans, “Threatened and endangered wildlife — like the Bengal tiger, Irrawaddy river dolphin, finless porpoise, and estuarine crocodile — live here. It is also a nursery for 90% of the aquatic species on the East coast of India and serves as a bio-shield for the fierce waves and winds of coastal storms.”\n\nMangroves are an important agent of another critical process — carbon sequestration, which basically means the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nRemoving carbon from the atmosphere is crucial in the fight against global warming. While all plants use up carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis, mangroves “extract up to five times more carbon than forests on land, incorporating it in their leaves, branches, roots and the sediments beneath them,” says an article by the United Nations Environment Programme.\n\nMangroves also have high carbon density, which is the amount of carbon a plant can store.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe Indian Sundarbans were classified as endangered in a 2020 assessment under the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, making a detailed study about their threats and fight-back mechanisms significant.\n\nWhat is the study?\n\nThe study, ‘Resilience of Sundarban mangroves in South Asia to Weather Extremes and Anthropogenic Water Pollution’, was conducted by researchers from IIT Bombay, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata, and National Remote Sensing Centre (ISRO), Hyderabad.\n\nA plant interacts with its atmosphere in various ways, and these interactions are an indication of its health. For example, a plant takes nutrients from soil and water, carbon dioxide from the air, and releases water vapour and oxygen through its leaves.\n\nThus, the study looked at the nutrient profile available to the mangroves in the soil from 2013 to 2015 and studied their response to it. It also looked at how mangroves reacted to natural events like a cyclone. This was done by studying the mangroves’ interactions with a variety of factors, including water, wind, water vapour, sunlight, etc.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nOne of the markers of a plant’s health is ‘vegetation productivity’, basically the rate at which it can convert solar energy into biomass through photosynthesis. To study this, researchers looked at the light being re-emitted (after absorption for photosynthesis) by the chlorophyll in the mangroves. They also looked at the data from a flux tower, which measures the rate at which gases like carbon dioxide and water vapour move between the earth (including plants) and the atmosphere.\n\nWhat did the study find?\n\n“Our results show that mangroves recover from physiological stresses caused by weather extremes quickly, within one to two weeks, and maintain stable productivity despite steeply declining nutrient composition due to human-induced water pollution. We demonstrate that mangroves maintain this stable productivity by increasing link strength and memory with the hydro-meteorological variables of the region,” the study says.\n\nTo establish “steeply declining nutrient composition”, the study considered the Redfield Ratio, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen to phosphorus, which has an optimum value of 106:16:1. “We found that the N/Ph ratio has constantly increased from being close to the Redfield ratio of around 16:1 in to an average value of around 75:1 in 2015. The increase is roughly five-fold, with a few months showing around 10-fold increases from 2013 to 2015. During the same period, the amount of Nitrates have increased, and Phosphates have decreased,” the study says.\n\nAnd what is “link strength and memory”?\n\nA large and complex vegetation system like mangroves has several links — intertwined roots, shared nutrients and soil composition, shared stress factors, etc. Memory in plants refers to “remembering” how they had reacted to a past stressful event, like a cyclone, and storing that response for the future.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSubimal Ghosh, Professor at IIT Bombay’s Centre for Climate Studies and one of the co-authors of the study, told The Indian Express, “We have found that depending on the stress they are facing, mangroves alter how they interact with the environment, in order to tide over the stressful event. For example, if water chemistry changes, mangroves adjust their response to hydrometeorological processes around them.”\n\nWhy are the findings significant?\n\nTo put it very simply, for now, the Sundarbans have shown resilience, but there is a limit to their ability to self-repair. The study sheds light on the challenges the Sundarbans are facing and is one step forward in looking for ways to protect and preserve them.\n\nAs the researchers write, “The mangrove resistance to natural and anthropogenic stressors observed reflects the resistance provided by highly connected networks. However, the limits of this resistance and the nature of associated critical transitions remain unknown. Our study advances the understanding of the dynamics of mangroves and calls for examining and quantifying the limits of mangrove resistance to anthropogenic stressors. The generated information will be essential for undertaking scientifically driven nature-based solutions interventions for restoring mangroves in South Asia.”",

    "title": "Offence not committed in ‘public view’: Why Bombay HC quashed SC/ST Act case",
    "authors": ["Arnav Chandrasekhar"],
    "raw_text": "The case in question\n\nIn Afshamaskar Laikhkan Pathan vs State of Maharashtra, the complainant claims she had entered into a relationship with someone who promised to marry her. But this man got engaged to someone else. When she went to meet him, she claims that she was assaulted by the man’s relatives who hurled casteist abuses at her.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nFollowing the incident, the complainant registered an FIR which included offences under Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the SC/ST Act. Section 3(1) lists offences that may be committed by persons who are not a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.\n\nSection 3(1)(r) punishes someone who “intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view”. Section 3(1)(s) punishes someone who “abuses any member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe by caste name in any place within public view”.\n\nCrucially, both provisions require the offence to be committed “in public view” in order to be prosecuted.\n\nWhat the Bombay HC decided\n\nWhile quashing proceedings against four accused under these provisions, a Bench of Justices Vibha Kankanwadi and Rohit Joshi stated that “mere insult or intimidation with a view to humiliate or hurling abuses in the name of caste will not constitute an offence under the said provisions”. They explained that “the incident need not be in a public place. It has to be in public view.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe Bench referred to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Hitesh Verma vs State of Uttarakhand in 2020, in which it held that “in order to constitute offence under Section 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the Atrocities Act, the alleged insult, intimidation causing humiliation and/or act of hurling abuses must be in public view for which presence of some third person/s is essential at the time of the incident. It is further held that the existence of any independent witness who has seen the incident is essential to make out the offence under the said provisions.”\n\nIn this context, the Bombay High Court pointed out that the chargesheet and the FIR in the current case did not contain a statement from any witness who had seen the alleged incident, and that the offences under Sections 3(1)(s) and 3(1)(r) were not made out. These charges and the proceedings related to them were quashed, though other charges under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the SC/ST Act were allowed to remain.\n\nThe ‘public view’ argument in SC/ST Act\n\nThe Karnataka High Court dealt with a similar case in Shivalingappa B Kerakalamatti vs State Of Karnataka in September 2023. The case, heard by a Bench of Justice M Nagaprasanna, involved a complainant who was allegedly assaulted on his way to work with a cycle chain while being abused with references to his caste. However, the Karnataka HC quashed the case which included charges under Sections 3(1)(s) and 3(1)(r).\n\nFor these offences, it held that “what is necessary is hurling of abuses in a public place or in a place of public view… Whether it was in a public place or in a place of public view is not forthcoming in the statements or in the summary of the charge sheet”.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIt further clarified that “Therefore, offence under the Act is not established merely on the fact that the informant is a member of Scheduled Caste”, and that there must be an intention to insult “a member of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe for the reason that the victim belongs to such caste”.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also weighed in on the “public view” requirement in recent years. In December 2024 the court set aside charges of intentional insult and intimidation under the SC/ST Act after finding that the alleged offence took place in the backyard of someone’s house, which it held “is not a place within the public view”.",

    "title": "Why the Union Budget needs to provide more for energy efficiency measures",
    "authors": ["Pramod Kumar Singh"],
    "raw_text": "The stakes are even higher post-pandemic. Resource constraints due to geopolitical tensions have underscored the importance of self-reliance. Energy efficiency is no longer just about conserving resources — it is central to national security and modernising India’s energy and urban infrastructure, reducing import dependence for energy and critical minerals, and positioning the nation as a competitive force on the global stage while contributing to climate goals.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhat kind of savings have resulted from India’s energy efficiency initiatives?\n\nData from the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) underscore the tremendous impact energy efficiency initiatives have had until now. Consider the following:\n\nOver 2018-2023, cumulative energy savings from national schemes have amounted to 189 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE), with electricity savings alone accounting for 90 million tonnes (1 MTOE is enough to power over 3 million Indian households for a year).\n\nIn the financial year 2023, energy savings from national schemes resulted in 50.8 MTOE savings with an equal share of thermal and electrical savings.\n\nIn the absence of energy efficiency, India’s energy consumption in 2022-23 would have been 6.6% higher than actuals, equivalent to the energy demand of Tamil Nadu.\n\nTo put the 2022-23 energy savings in perspective, the avoided thermal energy is equivalent to coal usage in 20 power plants (7% of India’s yearly coal consumption), and avoided electricity is equivalent to generation from 80 coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe electricity savings in 2022-23 is equivalent to installing 200 GW solar generation capacity whereas the country has added 97 GW solar till December 2024.\n\nThe economic impact of these savings is equally significant, with a reported INR 1.84 lakh crore in cost reductions during 2022-23, comparable to about 1.1% of India’s GDP.\n\nWhy do these efforts need even more attention?\n\nThe budgetary allocations for energy efficiency programs remain disproportionately low compared to the allocation for renewable energy.\n\nFor instance, in the 2023-24 Union Budget, Rs 19,100 crore was allocated to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, while the Bureau of Energy Efficiency received only Rs 230 crore.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSuch a difference overlooks the undeniable fact that energy efficiency measures often yield a far higher return on investment compared to renewable energy generation alone.\n\nConsider this simple example of energy-efficient ceiling fans. Ceiling fans are commonplace yet consume substantial electricity, contributing 17.5 GW to peak electricity demand. A government subsidy of Rs 1,000 per fan for 25 million energy-efficient models would cost Rs 2,500 crore. This investment would avoid 2.2 billion units (BU) of electricity generation per year, delivering double the energy savings compared to rooftop solar installations supported through equivalent subsidy size.\n\nIn addition to energy savings, energy-efficient fans significantly reduce CO2 emissions, contributing to India’s climate mitigation efforts. As policymakers seek effective energy transition strategies, combining the distribution of energy-efficient appliances with renewable energy initiatives can drive compounded energy savings and emission reductions.\n\nWhat is the link between energy efficiency and climate security?\n\nWe also need to recognise the indispensable role energy efficiency plays in modernising India’s energy and urban systems.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhile renewable energy investments are necessary to expand clean energy generation, they alone cannot achieve climate security or energy independence. The annual grid emissions factor has yet to see a meaningful decline, underscoring the urgent need for complementary energy efficiency measures.\n\nMoreover, investing in energy efficiency is not merely about reducing electricity consumption – it is about unlocking systemic savings across generation, transmission, and distribution.\n\nLosses in these areas represent significant economic and environmental costs, equivalent to the output of 55 coal power plants in 2021-22. Reducing these inefficiencies through targeted investments in energy efficiency would free up financial resources that can be redirected toward healthcare, education, and renewable energy projects.\n\nAs India seeks to solidify its position as a global leader and become developed, energy efficiency must become a national priority.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe Union Budget 2025 presents an opportunity for the government to recognise energy efficiency as the first fuel in its energy transition. This recognition must be accompanied by robust investment, policy support, and direct schemes designed to tap into the vast potential of energy efficiency measures.\n\nBy doing so, India can achieve a clean, resilient, and competitive energy future. Prioritising energy efficiency will not only strengthen the nation’s energy security and climate resilience but also ensure that its economic ambitions are realised sustainably and inclusively.\n\nPramod Kumar Singh is Senior Director, Research and Programmes, with Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE), a nonprofit energy-efficiency advocacy.",

    "title": "When a tiger killed Shanti: What makes women vulnerable to tiger attacks in Corbett",
    "authors": ["Aiswarya Raj"],
    "raw_text": "Two days after the incident, the tiger was captured by the Forest Department and sent to the Corbett Rescue Centre.\n\nSince 2017, Ramnagar division has seen 12 deaths in attacks by tigers, of which seven were of women. In 2024, five deaths were reported near the Corbett buffer area — four of these victims were women and three of them from Dhela, a village in the buffer zone of the Corbett National Park. So far this year, there have been two deaths in tiger attacks in two days.\n\nRamnagar Divisional Forest Officer Diganth Nayak says women often fall prey to tigers because they venture into forests to collect fodder for their cattle and firewood. “When women sit on their haunches to pick firewood and cut grass, tigers mistake them for prey,” he says.\n\nLife in a buffer zone\n\nThe Corbett National Park, spread over 1,288.31 square kilometres and three districts — Pauri, Nainital, and Almora — is home to 260 tigers, making this the park with the highest density of tigers in the country, according to the Status of Tiger report 2022. According to data provided by Saket Badola, director, national park, there are nearly 46 villages with a combined population of 2,939 near the Corbett buffer zone.\n\nWhile a few youth are employed in homestays and resorts, most of the villages surrounding the park rely on dairy and subsistence farming. But with the produce of rice and wheat barely enough for their families and with frequent instances of animals raiding their crops, the villagers turn to the forests for firewood and minor forest produce. Since most of the men have migrated to the cities for work, it leaves the women to shoulder the foraging responsibilities.\n\nOn a January morning, the forest department called a meeting at Dhela, a village on the road to one of the eight Corbett zones, to resolve this human-animal conflict and to find an answer to a prickly problem: how to stop women from venturing into the forests.\n\nAt the meeting, Corbett Deputy Director Rahul Mishra’s intervention — that legal action would be taken against villagers venturing into the forest — is met with anger.\n\n“Our women go to the forest for livelihood and it can’t be stopped. If you threaten to send us to jail, we will gladly go,” a man seethes.\n\nDFO Nayak shoots back, “You say you have been going to the forest for 20 years. Back then, there were 80 tigers. Now, there are over 260. We have to change our traditions. Nothing is more important than life.”\n\nDFO Nayak finally tables a resolution: “Women can go out to fetch firewood, but in groups of 15, twice a week from each village, and our forest officials will accompany them. This will decrease the chances of an encounter.” The officials also promise to bring fodder to the villages at nominal rates of Rs 2.50 per kg.\n\nWhy do women enter the forest?\n\nWhen the meeting ends, the women are the first to leave. Prema Mehra, 43, says the forest officials will stop accompanying them after two days. “They are more scared than us,” she says, and her group of 10 women laugh loudly.\n\nMimicking the DFO at the meeting, she says, “‘Is going to the forest for firewood more important than her life?’ Of course we need firewood and where will we get that but from the forests? See, my husband earns Rs 400 a day as a driver at the safari park, but he does not get a ride daily. We have 1.2 acres on which we grow wheat but that’s barely enough for us. Anyway, whatever little we grow has reduced drastically as animals keep raiding our crops. We cannot afford heaters or blowers. Firewood keeps us warm, heats our water, and helps us cook food. The government has given us gas cylinders, but who will pay us for refilling it every 20 days.”\n\nForest officials, however, say the women often illegally sell the firewood to homestays and resorts for Rs 300-400 during the winter season, when agriculture is on the wane.\n\nThough, under the Forest Rights Act, villagers are allowed to collect and use minor forest produce, this is restricted to self-consumption. Only the Uttarakhand Forest Department Corporation is allowed to engage in the sale of timber, firewood, bamboo and minor minerals for public and industries.\n\n“We have been asking the resorts not to buy from the villagers and have told them to produce the receipts of purchase from the Forest Corporation, yet, the practice continues,” he says.\n\nDr K Ramesh, scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India and Adjunct Professor at the University of British Columbia, says the problem requires more than just policing and compensation when a casualty happens. “The government should figure out a regional land-use strategy with zoning — mark out human-use areas, core wildlife habitat, buffer zones, and corridors,” he says.\n\nA kilometre away from the meeting ground, 76-year-old Devaki Devi is cutting grass on her small piece of land — fodder for her cow that’s cooped up in a dilapidated shed. “Today, I will manage with this, but soon, we will have to go again to the forest,” she says. A widow, Devaki’s six sons work in towns and cities in other states.\n\nThe burden of venturing out into the forests for foraging has been disproportionately shouldered by women over centuries.\n\nIn conservationist Jim Corbett’s fabled Man-Eaters of Kumaon, he mentions several instances of how women were vulnerable to tiger attacks as it was “their duty to fetch grass”. During one of his days out on the lookout for a ‘man-eater tiger’, Corbett writes of a woman he saw in the forest. “Was there no man? Yes, there was a man, but he was in the fields ploughing, and in any case, it was the duty of women to fetch water,” says the book published in 1944.\n\nShanti’s mother-in-law Anuli says, “We have to go to the forest for our livelihood. We don’t have a job. I had three goats which were eaten by the tiger once. The only source of income was the horse, but after Shanti’s death, we gave it away,” Anuli says.\n\nA neighbour, Muni Devi, says, “We have not stepped out of our homes in four days. We will not leave for two more days, uske baad phir se chaalu hoga (after that, we will go back to the forest).”\n\nIn 2007, the Forest Department came up with a plan to stop women from venturing into the forest — teaching them to stitch tote bags that they can sell at the Corbett souvenir shop. This was in addition to a souvenir shop that was opened in 2022 and a bakery a year later. However, villagers say the tote bag scheme has been stuck for the last three years.\n\nA hike in compensation for deaths caused by animal attacks — in Uttarakhand, it is currency Rs 6 lakh — has been a continuous demand by villagers. They cite the case of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where governments award Rs 25 lakh in similar situations.\n\nDr Ramesh of the Wildlife Institute of India, however, says compensation schemes are known to be counterproductive. “In Maharashtra, there have been cases of old people being thrown inside forests for families to get compensation money. There need to be long-term solutions. The reasons that drive women to risk their lives need to be studied,” he says.\n\nGirls in the villages\n\nWhile it’s hard to keep their mothers out, the younger girls in these villages hope they would never have to venture inside the forests.\n\nThough her father dropped out of school after Class 10 and mother after Class 5, Lalita Mehra, 22, has an MSc in Botany. She is now in Dehradun, preparing for an exam that will take her closer to her goal of being a forester. “There were no colleges near our village that offered a PCB combination (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), so I went to Dehradun. When I called my family two days ago, they told me that a man was killed by a tiger three km away from our village. I have been pleading with my mother not to go to the forests,” she says.\n\nHer sister Babita says that after Class 12, she plans to leave the village to prepare for a defence personnel test. An aunt, she says, was killed in a tiger attack 18 years ago. “We girls will put an end to this practice of going to the forest,” she insists.\n\nAt Okhaldhunga, Shanti Devi’s 23-year-old daughter-in-law Kiran says she has never ventured inside the forest. A Bachelor of Pharmacy student, Kiran shakes her head when asked if she goes to the forest. “I will never go. I live in Almora for my studies and visit the village every two weeks. Now with my mother-in-law’s death, there is no one at home to look after my father-in-law, so everything is uncertain. But I am certain that I do not want to do this work. I will look for a job in the local anganwadi after graduation,” she says.\n\nBut the mothers are not listening. Around 4 pm on Saturday, armed with a sickle, Anita Devi, 31, prepares to leave for the forest, a routine she hasn’t missed in 15 years. “We are going to work, but there is fun in going together. Nothing will happen to us,” she says, calling out to her friends in Kumaoni.",

    "authors": ["C. Raja Mohan"],
    "raw_text": "Story continues below this ad\n\nFor instance, Western conservatives share common ground with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who promotes Russian nationalism and celebrates traditional Russian culture and values. Similarly, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s worldview is rooted in nationalism and a claim to an exceptional Sinic civilisation. Ironically, Russia and China once the champions of enlightenment universalism are aligned more closely with Western conservatism on nationalism, traditional values, and sovereignty. The implications of these connections remain to be seen, but they cut across many presumed fault lines of the international system today.\n\nFor now, though, the focus is on the ideological battles within the West. They culminated in Trump’s victory in the US elections last year. Europe is now facing its own challenges, including the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s advancements in the auto industry.\n\nTrump is exerting direct pressure on European economic and security policies and even demanding an important part of its territory. His ally, Elon Musk, is using his platform X to challenge the traditional liberal and centrist consensus in European politics by supporting parties labelled as far-right. Recently, Musk has engaged quite vigorously with British and German politics. He launched a tirade against unchecked immigration and British tolerance of crimes in the name of respecting cultural diversity. In Germany, he has endorsed the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is currently polling second after the conservative Christian Democratic Union.\n\nThese external and internal pressures are poised to reshape the European political landscape this year. Whether this will lead to a “great” Europe remains uncertain, but change is imminent.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asserts that Europe is “already great”, citing its unique social market economy, robust trade sector, and higher living standards compared to global competitors. However, she acknowledges the need for change, stating that Europe has relied on global trade, cheap Russian energy, and US security for too long. To sustain growth over the next 25 years, Europe must adapt, prompting her to commission a report on European competitiveness from Mario Draghi. Von der Leyen is expected to announce this week a road map to implement some of Draghi report’s recommendations.\n\nThe relationship between Europe and major powers like Russia, China, and the US is no longer a matter of concern for high-state policy; it is being influenced by public sentiment on the street.\n\nVarious European conservative parties are gathering in Brussels this week to find strategies to emulate Trump’s electoral and policy success. Although these parties lack a unified platform like the Republican Party, they hope to influence upcoming elections across Europe. While they may not form governments independently, their growing strength has shifted the centrist parties further to the right, weakening the traditional consensus against far-right parties.\n\nAcross Europe, right-wing movements are gaining traction due to voter worries about immigration, economic stagnation, cultural identity, and dissatisfaction with the current political order. The collapse of Germany’s governing coalition and the upcoming election in February 2025 highlight this urgency. The AfD has capitalised on the German discontent with traditional parties, becoming a serious contender in federal elections. Similar trends are observable in Italy, Poland, and the Netherlands, where right-wing populism is challenging the political mainstream.\n\nEuropean elites used to view their political culture as distinct, if not superior, to that of the US. However, American political influence has increasingly permeated European societies. Trump’s MAGA movement has fuelled the resurgence of the far-right in Europe, fostering unprecedented connections between populist forces across the Atlantic.\n\nTrump’s success has inspired nationalist movements in the West, offering a model for challenging established political elites. His strong stance against illegal immigration, “woke” ideology, and globalisation resonates with many European leaders. In a region that has bet its future on supra-national European Union, there is a growing desire to reclaim national identity and political autonomy.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the rise of radical right movements in Europe:\n\nEconomic anxiety: Years of stagnation, worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war, have led to inflation, housing shortages, and rising inequality. The right has exploited these issues, promoting protectionist policies and blaming immigrants for economic problems.\n\nConcerns about immigration: The influx of migrants has raised fears regarding cultural identity and security. Far-right leaders have intensified these concerns, framing immigrants as threats to national stability.\n\nCultural displacement: Globalisation and multiculturalism have led to feelings of cultural erosion among some populations. The radical right positions itself as a defender of traditional values against progressive policies.\n\nDisenchantment with the establishment: Many voters view mainstream political parties as elitist and unresponsive. Far-right parties present themselves as alternatives, promising to restore power to the people.\n\nNormalisation of extremist rhetoric: Social media and alternative media have made radical right ideas more mainstream.\n\nDisillusionment with the EU: Many right-wing groups are Eurosceptic, challenging EU policies on migration, climate change, and economic integration. This scepticism threatens collective action on shared challenges.\n\nSimilar to the US, traditional structures of Western social, political, and economic organisation are being challenged from the right in Europe. This political upheaval increases the pressure for a new compact between elites and the populace in the West. The outcome of this internal battle in the West will have profound implications for India and the world. With India’s rising stakes in the West, Delhi must pay closer attention to the internal political changes within the US and Europe and their impact on the global economy and geopolitics.\n\nAdditionally, Indian political parties should shed their isolationism, renew their historical connections to Western political parties and engage with emerging forces in Europe and North America.",

    "title": "Behind Arvind Kejriwal’s outreach to the middle class: Does AAP chief sense a shift?",
    "authors": ["Neerja Chowdhury"],
    "raw_text": "Kejriwal is essentially a creature of the middle-class driven “India Against Corruption” movement of 2010-11 led by Anna Hazare that created the environment that sent the Manmohan Singh government packing in 2014. He made the successful transition from a movement to a political party, secured its national party status. and positioned it as the party of the poor.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIf the socio-economic survey undertaken by the Delhi government in 2018 is anything to go by, at best, 8% of the families in the National Capital spent between Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 per month and can be categorised as the middle class in Delhi. So, theoretically speaking, Kejriwal does not have to worry unduly about such a small number though private agencies believe that Delhi’s middle class is as big as 45% of the population of the megalopolis.\n\nA calculated move?\n\nKejriwal’s middle-class card appears to be calculated to achieve three things. Always quick to sense the direction of the wind, the AAP chief, who is fighting an existential battle this time, may realise that this not-so-large, though highly articulate and media-savvy section of society may have become disenchanted with his party and may seek a change on February 5. They are likely to look at the BJP as an alternative — it has been out of power in Delhi for more than a quarter century — than a struggling Congress that, at best, is likely to cut into the AAP’s votes.\n\nThe AAP chief may also worry that voter fatigue and an anti-incumbency of 12 years may also take its toll on some of the “underclasses” who have stayed by his side. For, a poor person who happily sends her child to a reformed government school also worries about the potholed roads she has to navigate or about the hacking cough she suffers from, breathing polluted air day after day, even as she goes to a mohalla clinic for free medical help. At the end of the day, the usually loud middle class does influence others around it.\n\nKejriwal is trying to keep his party as broad-based as possible. Significantly, his seven-point manifesto for the middle class is not a list of promises. They are demands he has put out, as if on behalf of the middle class, to the Narendra Modi government on issues that agitate them today and have led to their growing economic hardship.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nEven if not a spokesperson for them, he is trying to demonstrate that he stands by their side as their well-wisher. His pitch is calculated to remind the middle class what the Modi government has not done for them. It comes as a warning, saying “beware” before you consider voting for the BJP.\n\nWhen Kejriwal recently spoke about the “tax terrorism’ the middle class has to put up with, or the GST they pay on goods for daily use, or called for 10% of the Union government’s budget to be used on education, and a fee cap in private schools, he was touching a raw nerve as the middle class knows huge concessions have been given to the rich and “revdis” to the poor. As the AAP chief put it evocatively in Hindi, the middle class “pees rahe hain (getting squeezed)”.\n\nComing before the presentation of the Union Budget on February 1, Kejriwal may also want to put Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the spot. As it is, there has been a growing demand from certain sections that taxes — direct as well as GST slapped on essential items — be reduced to give relief to the middle class.\n\nMiddle class versus Mandal politics\n\nThe BJP’s narrative against “freebies” also plays on the middle-class angst that revdis for the poor are doled out at their expense.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nNormally, political parties concentrate on the concerns of the poor and the backward who are larger in number, and Kejriwal is no exception. His promise of free electricity (up to 200 units) and water (up to 20,000 litres per household), government school reforms, access to free medicines at mohalla clinics, free bus tickets for women, and a promise of Rs 2,100 to women each month are all geared to reach out to the poorer sections, who remain his best bet.\n\nFor successive Prime Ministers and Chief Ministers, it has not been possible to win elections without the support of the poor. Indira Gandhi relied on the “garibi hatao (end poverty)“ slogan to win the 1971 election, V P Singh implemented the Mandal report to give reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs; and Narendra Modi used the word poor in his first speech as Prime Minister in 2014 and created a pro-poor safety net with his welfare measures.\n\nIt was Singh’s Mandal politics that led to a pushback from the middle class. The middle-class youth saw the doors closing on them and there were widespread protests. Whether it was Gandhians, Marxists, religious hardliners, or secularists, the middle class, largely synonymous with the upper castes, united in opposition to Mandal, which to them spelt shrinking opportunities.\n\nThey turned to the BJP for protection and support and the party withdrew support to the V P Singh government. The Mandir movement, or Hindutva, as a manifestation of Hindu nationalism, grew in the years that followed, with this aggrieved middle class becoming a mainstay of this upsurge. It was later when Modi, from an OBC group, took over, positioning himself as the “chaiwala” PM, that he roped in the poorer and backward sections to widen the BJP’s base.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nKejriwal perhaps now senses the beginnings of a middle-class pushback nationally and is hoping to tap into this force not just for the imminent Delhi election but beyond it for his long-term goals.",

I have simply followed orders,” Sawant said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“The moment the SP began collecting information about Bajrang Dal leaders in Goa, the government panicked and immediately transferred her,” said state Congress president Amit Patkar. “This clearly shows that the BJP is not interested in governance but in shielding its ideological allies and suppressing officers who perform their duty with integrity.”\n\nPatkar alleged the “hasty transfer” was yet another “glaring example of how the BJP-RSS ideology is interfering with the administration to protect its divisive agenda”.\n\nBajrang Dal’s Goa convenor Viraj Desai said he did not have any information about the SP’s transfer or whether the police were seeking any information about his outfit’s members. “Bajrang Dal’s name is being needlessly dragged into this. We are not concerned or involved in departmental affairs of the police,” he said.\n\nSawant’s transfer came two days after she received a “special recognition award” from Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai for “accurate planning and development of security forces, static surveillance teams and flying squads and playing a key role in ensuring peace during Lok Sabha 2024 elections in the state”. She was also selected for the President’s Medal for Distinguished Service last year.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAfter graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Dhempe College in 1989, Sawant taught at a school for a brief period before joining the police in 1990 as a sub-inspector. As an inspector, she was among the police officers who investigated the sexual assault case against former Tehelka editor-in-chief Tarun Tejpal. In 2014, she was promoted to Deputy Superintendent of Police.\n\nPatkar alleged the police were being manipulated to serve the BJP’s political interests instead of upholding the law. “This is nothing but an act of intimidation against an honest officer who was merely doing her job. The BJP government has once again exposed itself as an enabler of lawlessness, ensuring that no action is taken against fringe elements that threaten Goa’s communal harmony,” he said.\n\n“What is the government trying to hide? Why is it afraid of a fair investigation into Bajrang Dal leaders? This transfer is proof that the law enforcement agencies in Goa are being used as mere puppets of the BJP to safeguard its false narrative,” he added. The BJP and the government have not yet responded to the allegations.\n\nThe Bajrang Dal, the youth wing of the VHP, played a prominent role in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement for building a Ram temple in Ayodhya. The outfit was banned in the aftermath of the demolition but the ban was revoked a year later. The Bajrang Dal has been accused numerous times over the years of harassing religious minorities over issues of “illegal conversion” and “love jihad”.",

    "title": "DeepSeek’s Sputnik moment: 5 ways in which US-China AI race plays out for India",
    "authors": ["C. Raja Mohan"],
    "raw_text": "One is the strategic salience of the moment. Historical comparisons are odious, but in terms of the sheer shock it produced, DeepSeek reminds us of the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik, the Earth’s first artificial satellite in October 1957. The stunning demonstration of Soviet Russia’s capabilities in frontier technology set off panic within the smug American establishment that was so confident of its dominance in science and technology. It also spurred Washington into a massive space programme ofits own, including the landing of the first human on the Moon.\n\nMonday’s bloodbath on Wall Street of AI stocks dramatises the surprise that shattered Silicon Valley’s Second is the intensification of the geopolitical rivalry between the US and China. If Sputnik ratcheted up the Cold War that had begun a decade earlier between America and the Soviet Union, DeepSeek heralds an escalation of the geopolitical rivalry between the US and China that has been unfolding for nearly a decade. Much like the Sputnik in the 1950s, DeepSeek brings a new technological frontier into the great power competition.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nBut the Sputnik moment did not tell us how the tech race would play out in subsequent decades. Moscow offered vigorous competition to Washington during the Cold War, but could not sustain its technological parity after the collapse of the Soviet Union. China is a different kind of power, with a large GDP and massive investments in frontier technologies. Yet there is no telling how its rivalry with America will unfold in the coming years. For now, though, it is reasonable to assume that the US and China are way ahead of other major powers and poised to make the AI race a bipolar one.\n\nThird, DeepSeek is a reminder that money buys many things, but it is not everything; certainly not love or the capacity for innovation. If the US is seen as pouring billions of dollars into building more computing power and better AI models, DeepSeek has shown it is possible to do more with less.\n\nThat should give hope for India and other middle powers like France. The gap between the US and China is much less than that between the two of them and the rest. While the middle powers can’t keep pace with the US and China, they could do enough to stay in the AI game.\n\nBoth India and France (Europe) talk about “Sovereign AI”. They will need strategies that will emphasise both cooperation with the US and independent development of AI. Although the AI world might never be truly multipolar, there would be considerable room for other players capable of research, development, and innovation.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nFourth, that room would be much larger if the US chooses the partnership model with allies to compete with China, instead of going it alone. The Biden Administration was open to partnership with India, but concerns about leakage of technology from India to Russia had put a dampener on the kind of access the US is willing to offer India on AI chips. For Delhi, the time is now to decide on how much weight it is willing to give Russia in advancing its interests with the US on the AI game.\n\nFinally, Sputnik is an important reminder that great powers will also embark on cooperation in advanced technologies. Although Sputnik’s launch in 1957 set off an arms race, outer space eventually provided a venue to cooperate and demonstrate their shared commitment to humanity’s technological advancement and global peace. The detente years (the 1970s) saw Moscow and Washington begin cooperation in outer space that endures to the day.\n\nThere are many in the US and China who think the two sides should cooperate on AI for the benefit of the world, much in the manner America and Russia did in outer space. It is indeed possible: AI cooperation could be on the table when Washington and Beijing begin a substantive engagement. The Biden years have seen the US and China start a dialogue on AI to prevent its misuse and potential destabilisaton of nuclear deterrence in the AI age.\n\nAs the military applications of AI begin to proliferate, it is not difficult to imagine US-China cooperation in the creation of a set of rules to control the spread of AI, much in the manner that the US and Russia developed a nuclear control regime in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIndia found itself on the wrong side of these nuclear lines, thanks to Delhi’s ideological confusion on atomic issues, policy incoherence, and geopolitical sentimentalism. It took nearly four decades to undo that nuclear blunder. Hopefully, Delhi is smarter today and can define its strategic interests in the AI domain clearly and ensure that India will be part of shaping the global governance of AI rather than a mere subject of it.",

    "title": "Merenla Imsong, Paatal Lok 2’s Rose Lizo, opens up about depth of the character, her mother’s reaction: ‘She had high BP after watching the show’",
    "authors": ["Shruti Kaushal"],
    "raw_text": "In an interview with SCREEN, Imsong opened up about how she brought the complex character to life, why her mother’s blood pressure rose after watching the show, and her struggles as a ‘Northeastern’ actor in Mumbai.\n\nPreparing to be Rose: A journey of understanding addiction\n\nTo prepare for Rose, Imsong—who did not watch Season 1—immersed herself in the world of addiction. She watched documentaries, interviewed people who had struggled with addiction, and even reached out to those who had been through rehab. But what truly shaped her understanding of Rose was a YouTube interview with a woman talking about her addiction and how she didn’t want her child to go through the same ordeal.\n\n“That’s when I realised it’s not about the physical transformation or the outer appearance. It’s about understanding their story, their pain. I realised I wasn’t supposed to feel pity for her. She’s not weak. She’s strong, she’s fighting every day. And that’s what I wanted to bring to the character,” she said.\n\nPlaying Rose wasn’t without its challenges. When asked about a scene that has stayed with her, Imsong shared that she was often terrified of overplaying certain emotions, particularly when it came to portraying physical or emotional states. “The scene where I meet Reuben while drunk was a huge concern. I didn’t want to overdo it. Being drunk on screen is tough. There’s a fine line between being authentic and being over-the-top,” she said.\n\nWorking with Jaideep Ahlawat, Tillotama Shome\n\n“I was nervous, of course,” confessed Imsong when asked about working with terrific actors like Jaideep Ahlawat, Tillotama Shome, and Ishwak Singh.\n\n“When I first met Jaideep, I was intimidated. The man has a larger-than-life presence. But he was so kind, so welcoming. It made me feel at ease. Ishwak was super chill, and Tilottama, I had known her a bit before, and we got along like old friends,” she said.\n\nRose’s character in Pataal Lok 2 is undeniably intense, offering a portrayal that could be deeply unsettling for many. Her struggle with heroin addiction and the battle against her inner demons left Imsong’s mother in trauma. “My mother got very high blood pressure after watching the show,” Imsong said, adding that her mother also told me that worrying about Hathiram made her shoulders stiff.\n\n“She was extremely upset about a certain character’s death, which the whole Internet is upset about,” Imsong told SCREEN. She also shared how her mother was terrified of Daniel (played by Prashant Tamang). “I had to convince her he’s actually a very sweet, soft-spoken guy,” she said.\n\nRepresentation and Northeast India\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of Paatal Lok 2 is its portrayal of Northeastern characters and the social issues they face. From identity struggle to discrimination to the challenge of being “othered,” Imsong said she hoped that such shows can be a stepping stone for more diverse representations of the Northeast in mainstream media.\n\n“It’s frustrating sometimes,” she said, “I get cast in roles that specifically require a Northeastern character. And there’s always this sense that we have to carry the burden of our race with us. We don’t always have to explain our identity. We’re just people.”\n\nBut, Imsong is hopeful. “The industry is slowly evolving. More stories are coming out, and I hope that with time, there will be a shift, where Northeastern characters are just characters, not defined by their region or race,” she said.\n\nCasting beyond social media following\n\nIn times when social media following plays an intrinsic role in bagging a role in a movie or OTT project, Imsong—who has earlier worked with Neena Gupta and Chunky Panday in Shuruaat Ka Twist—believes that it was her audition that led her to Rose Lizo.\n\n“I do not think social media had anything to do with me being cast because the creators of the show have been very particular about that. I remember Sudip Sharma, the creator of the show, talking about how casting directors these days share actors’ profiles with their social media follower count. And he said, ‘This makes absolutely no sense to me because I’m not going to hire someone based on the followers.’ So, I really like to believe that whatever I did on Instagram had nothing to do with me being cast,” Imsong said.\n\n“I was very fortunate the story is set in Nagaland, and they needed Naga actors. They needed people who could speak the language. I also kind of had the build which fit the character,” she said.",

Standing outside the morgue, Yadav, in his 30s and a native of Uttar Pradesh’s Pratapgarh, looked more and more anxious as the day progressed.\n\n“My sisters, including Renu, went to the Sangam Tuesday but the rest of them are safe. I went to another hospital (Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital) twice and asked the police to make announcements but they asked me to wait in the queue,” he said.\n\n“They are not saying how many dead bodies they have received. Don’t they have the data?” asked an agitated Manish Pandey, who is also searching for his sister, Vibha Malik Tripathi.\n\nData was in stark abundance at the sprawling grounds of the Maha Kumbh: torn sandals, clothing, backpacks, water bottles, personal belongings of those caught in the stampede. Police personnel tried to maintain some order, forming human chains and shouting instructions over loudspeakers.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThere were varying accounts of what had transpired. Some eyewitnesses said there was a sudden swell of the crowd on the road leading to the “Sangam Nose,” the triangular landmass considered the spot of the Sangam or where the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati merge.\n\nSome eyewitnesses claimed three of the four gates leading to this ghat were closed, leading devotees to crowd near the only one that was open. A video doing the rounds of many phones at the site showed part of a barricade being pushed open by the crowd as hapless security personnel watch a section of the crowd flow out, a trickle turning into a gush.\n\n“There was a scuffle, a (wooden) barrier broke, and many people died and several were injured,” said 60-year-old Beri Devi, whose husband is among those missing. “I went to the Mela hospital first, and they sent me to the mortuary.”\n\nOthers talked of chaos near Pillar No. 147, close to the site of the stampede. Jayprakash Soni, who was waiting at the mortuary for the body of his 65-year-old mother, said there was a sudden surge in the crowd.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“Around 1-1:30 am, the crowd started running here and there and there was no policeman in sight. People started falling and others kept walking on them,” Soni said. His father and children escaped the crush, he said, but not his mother. “The crowd came and she got trampled.”\n\nDevki Rajput, who walked from the mela site to the Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital to look for her missing aunt, said: “Twenty of us were together when we went for our bath at around 12:30 am. Then the crowd started to swell. Within minutes, I lost my aunt… The situation was such that we didn’t think any one of us would survive.”\n\nBasdev Sharma came from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh with his family. He said they had proceeded for their bath with their belongings, their money carefully tucked away.\n\n“There was suddenly a massive crowd,” Basdev said, his voice trembling. “One of my family members was crushed. We had taken our dip and were returning when we saw her lying unconscious… People just walked all over her. No one even stopped.” She suffered multiple injuries to her chest and legs.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nRam Prasad Yadav, also from Sultanpur, said he found himself gasping for breath as the crowds around him swelled. “I was making my way towards the river when suddenly, I felt myself falling… Before I could get up, the crowd was walking over me.”\n\nRam Prasad was among the lucky ones, he has had minor injuries. However, his 65-year-old mother was left severely injured. “We had to call an ambulance to take her to the hospital,” he said. “But now, we have no money. No phone. I don’t even know how we will return home.”\n\nOm Prakash Yadav said his sister Reena had taken a dip last night. “But then the crowd came, and people just fell under. I didn’t even know she was gone until morning. They told me she was Body Number 27.”\n\nBallia-based Baljeet Singh, who lost his wife Mira, remembered the crowd becoming a monstrous force, pressing against them. “There was no way we could save ourselves,” he said, his voice shaking. “I felt my wife slip away from my grasp. Another relative of mine… I’m hearing they didn’t make it either.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nJagwanti wept beside a body bag, standing next to an ambulance carrying her sister-in-law Rita and mother Rampati. Her father Dhanramraj survived with a broken leg.\n\nThey had come in a group of 20 from Jaunpur, Jagwanti said. “We begged the police to help us,” she said, breaking down. “We screamed, we cried, but nobody listened. I thought we were all going to die.”\n\nShe added that the police could have done little. “They had to run for their own lives… The crowd kicked my bhabhi (sister-in-law) to death. She has a small child waiting for her back home.”\n\nPhool Chand Vishwakarma lost his wife. “I got trapped for 30 minutes,” he said. “By the time I made it out, I saw my wife lying. She was gone.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAt the ghat, Laxmi from Chhatarpur, Bihar, grieved alone for her husband, Hakum, refusing to speak to anyone.\n\nAt nightfall, a group of four people, all from Karnataka, were huddled together back at the morgue in deep mourning. Outside, medics were piling four bodies into two waiting ambulances that will now be taken to Delhi and flown back to Bengaluru.\n\nAmong the deceased was the husband of Kanchan Koparde. “We were at the Kumbh and were about to go take a dip when, around 1-1.30 am, a crush of people came straight towards us. My husband, a friend, and two more acquaintances were caught in the stampede and there was no space to run,” she said, fighting back tears, before she boarded a waiting ambulance.",

    "authors": ["IE Online"],
    "raw_text": "However, as India aspires to emerge as an alternative to China and a global manufacturing hub, sector-focused growth strategy will provide a roadmap to the industry.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWe might witness a transition from generic production-linked incentives to tailored sector-specific programmes that position India prominently on the global value chain map, all the while being steered by the fundamental principles of sustainability.\n\nIn addition to incentivising investments, a comprehensive revamp of custom rates and trade procedures has long been on the cards of the Finance Minister. The government has announced a campaign for the rationalisation of customs duty levies that will help reduce classification disputes, remove duty inversions, and provide ease of trade. A simplified customs duty structure taking into account classification inconsistencies, multiple exemptions, impact of free-trade agreements (FTAs) will have a constructive influence on India’s manufacturing capabilities and overall competitiveness.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the success of past amnesty schemes in direct taxes and indirect taxes, an amnesty scheme under Customs Law will additionally lead to releasing the locked-up capital and will ease the burden on businesses and the judiciary. Less tax disputes, an indicator of a matured and investor-friendly jurisdiction will also provide required impetus to the local players and will reinforce investor confidence.\n\nThe initiatives to enhance the ease of doing business are central to the government’s policy strategy and hence it is expected that the Finance Minister may still include them in her budget proposals.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nCrafting a strategic plan to automate trade procedures, with a particular emphasis on the digitalisation of customs compliance, would be advantageous. The remarkable success of the GST system, which has effectively bridged the gap between tax authorities and taxpayers, resulting in increased tax buoyancy, serves as an exemplary model. Customs procedures, while mostly automated, still entail manual processes like submission of Bill of Entries on ICEGATE portal. Replicating the GST model and enabling access to ICEGATE to be able to transmit huge volume of data digitally through APIs or intermediaries could be a viable approach to streamline this process. Implementation of online module for payment of differential custom duty/ interest/other amounts and online amendment of Bill of Entry and its alignment with GSTN would certainly help importers getting the credit for ad hoc payments currently made through TR6 challans.\n\nAnother measure towards ease of doing business is allowing periodic payment of customs duty as against each assignment under MOOWR Regulations and enable the functionality on Customs EDI portal for tagging multiple in-bond BoE with single ex-bond BoE.\n\nThe proposed introduction of Section 65A to the Customs Act, 1962 which mandates IGST payments for goods imported into MOOWR units would also reduce the scheme’s viability and impact working capital of taxpayers. The same can be withdrawn to maintain the attractiveness of the scheme.\n\nAllowance of depreciation on clearance of capital goods to Domestic Tariff Area is another ask which will align this scheme with different export-oriented schemes.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSimilarly, the current SEZ Act also suffers from treating goods cleared in DTA as imported goods and levying full customs duties while other export-oriented schemes only require the importer to pay taxes on the import duty foregone on the imported products.\n\nBringing all the schemes on parity will continue to give impetus to the SEZ sector. The government has consistently given economic impetus to the industry in the budget exercise in the past, and there is a strong belief that this administration will present a well-reasoned and enabling budget in Parliament, outlining the imperative policy directives to give boost to the industry.\n\nBipin Sapra is tax partner, EY India.

    "authors": ["IE Online"],
    "raw_text": "Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity, causing unpredictable water availability, more frequent droughts, and intense floods, particularly in agricultural regions. Trends indicate that dry seasons are becoming drier, while wet seasons are getting wetter. Reduced precipitation is affecting groundwater recharge, and increasing precipitation intensity leads to more floods, further polluting water sources.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIndia is also prone to water-related disasters, with over 12 per cent of its land area being flood-prone and 28 per cent vulnerable to drought during different seasons. Floods account for 47 per cent of all disasters that have occurred in India in the last 100 years, and droughts occur every summer.\n\nCurrent landscape and initiatives\n\nIndia has embarked on several missions, including the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT 1.0 & 2.0) and the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), targeting safe drinking water for urban and rural households.\n\nNo. Mission Launch Year Aim Progress 1 Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2015 Ensure universal Water supply in 500 cities, focus on water infrastructure and smart management systems. Urban-focused programme. Over 80% of water supply projects completed, benefiting about 4 crore urban residents. 2 Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) 2019 Provide functional household tap connections (FHTCs) to every rural household by 2024. In 2019, 3 crore (17%) had tap water.\n\nBy Dec 2024, 15 crore (80%) have tap water. Some states achieved 100% coverage, some lag.\n\nSource: Ministry of Jal Shakti\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nProspects for sustainable water management in India\n\nCurrently, all schemes for providing clean drinking water are standalone. This causes excessive reliance on ground and surface water to meet the increasing demand. It also poses a challenge of depletion of groundwater table and causes drought-like situations in rural and urban areas.We are already seeing these situations in some metro cities like Chennai and Bengaluru.\n\nIndia uses about 230 cubic kilometres of groundwater annually, which is more than 25 per cent of the global usage, making it the world’s largest user of groundwater. In India, about 90 per cent of groundwater extracted is used for irrigating over 60 per cent of the irrigated land with 20 million tubewells installed.\n\nAs India strives to become a $30 trillion economy with its vision of Viksit Bharat @ 2047, the upcoming budget presents an opportunity to address the challenge in sustainability of water supply to rural and urban population.\n\nNow, it is the time to look for sustainable water resources to meet the future demand of water and preventing the exploitation of limited natural resources.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nGovernment budget allocation for water sector\n\nIn the upcoming budget, the government is expected to make substantial provisions to support growth, modernisation, and sustainability of India’s water sector. The key initiatives that can be adopted for sustainable water management are as follows:\n\nEnhanced reforms for WTP: A significant contributor to water pollution is wastewater, with poor waste management in urban areas — only 29 per cent of municipal wastewater is treated. Domestic effluents make up a large portion of water contamination, with more than 71 per cent remaining untreated and disposed of in the environment. The lack of adequate water infrastructure has led to serious issues such as waterlogging and contamination.\n\nThe budget should prioritise the establishment of a comprehensive programme for the development of drainage, sanitation facilities, and wastewater treatment plants (WTP) at the rural level. For urban areas, large-scale sewage treatment plants (STP) and WTP facilities should be developed to treat wastewater, enabling the use of non-potable water or greywater for irrigation, agriculture, and industrial processes.\n\nUrban rainwater harvesting systems: India currently stores only 30 days of rainfall, compared to 900 days in developed countries.\n\nThe budget should mandate the installation of rainwater harvesting systems in new buildings and retrofit existing structures. Implementing green roofs to capture and retain rainwater can help replenish groundwater and reduce stormwater runoff. Recent initiatives, such as installing about 900 rainwater harvesting pits in the National Capital Region as part of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS), should be further expanded to other areas to promote sustainable water availability.\n\nSmart water grids: Non-revenue water (NRW), which refers to water lost during distribution, is a significant issue in India, with an average NRW level of about 40 per cent. Several factors contribute to high NRW levels, the majority being pipeline leakages and inadequate maintenance of existing infrastructure. The government should prioritise schemes and programmes that invest in smart water grids incorporating sensors and real-time monitoring to detect leakages, manage pressure, and optimise water distribution. This will allow early detection of leakages and improve overall water supply.\n\nNational River Linking Project: This ambitious project aims to transfer water from surplus river basins to deficit ones, addressing regional imbalances in water availability — i.e., abundant monsoon water in one location versus water scarcity in another. Due to these imbalances, many parts of the country experience droughts, while others face floods annually. The budget should focus on promoting river linkage projects of national importance, such as the Ken-Betwa river link, to transfer water from surplus to deficit areas and ensure long-term sustainability.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nPromoting drip irrigation: Drip irrigation is a system that has the potential to conserve water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either from above the soil surface or below it. Drip irrigation systems distribute water through a network of valves, pipes, and emitters.\n\nThe budget should encourage the widespread adoption of drip irrigation systems that deliver water directly to plant roots, minimising evaporation losses.\n\nZero liquid discharge for industries: The government should mandate the adoption of zero liquid discharge (ZLD) systems for water-intensive industries, ensuring that wastewater is treated and recycled for reuse. Encouraging the development of eco-industrial parks, where industries share and reuse water resources, can significantly reduce freshwater demand and pollution.\n\nDesalination: The government should invest in large-scale desalination plants powered by a combination of renewable energy sources and waste-to-energy technology. Desalination plants not only generate clean water but also transform waste into a valuable resource, creating a sustainable and self-sufficient water production system.\n\nA comprehensive action plan with clear goals, deadlines, and accountability is essential. Enhancing water quality monitoring, expanding clean water programme coverage, and encouraging community involvement are vital steps. Public awareness campaigns can also significantly influence water conservation practices.\n\nThe goal of universal access to clean drinking water in India is not just a policy objective but an ethical obligation. The upcoming budget can set a definitive course toward ensuring sustainable clean water for all. With collaboration from the government, civil society, and the private sector, India can look forward to a future where clean water is the norm and waterborne diseases are eradicated. The vision of “Water for All” is within reach.\n\nShailesh Agarwal is partner – risk consulting at EY India.

The cost of accessing higher end GPUs would be Rs 150 per hour, and using lower end GPUs would cost Rs 115.85 per hour. To further ease access to these services, the government will give a 40 per cent subsidy to end users on the total price.\n\n“Globally, GPU access costs $2.5-$3 per hour. We are making it available, after the subsidy for around $1 per hour,” Vaishnaw said.\n\nUnder the IndiaAI Mission, the government has also selected 18 application-level AI solutions for the first round of funding. Vaishnaw said that these applications focus on the areas of agriculture, learning disabilities and climate change.",

    "authors": ["Soumyarendra Barik"],
    "raw_text": "The Survey proposed the concept of “stewarding institutions,” which would be “agile, crosscutting across sectors and up to date on the latest developments, so that they are equipped to identify both opportunities and threats. Stewarding institutions will have to be responsible for designing an approach that delicately balances public welfare without stifling innovation”.\n\nIt clarified that stewarding “does not imply placing restrictions on innovation or dictating a narrow set of applications for technology,” but means that policymakers should “demonstrate a certain degree of cognisance when it comes to emerging technologies, so that when the need arises, they stand well-placed to mitigate any adverse effects that emerge as by-products of technological applications”.\n\nRegulatory frameworks will need to be revisited and amended to ensure that the use of AI aligns with societal values, balancing innovation with accountability and transparency, the Survey said. “However, regulations will go only thus far.”\n\nIn chapter 13, titled ‘Labour in the AI era: Crisis or catalyst?’ the Survey said that the corporate sector has to display a high degree of social responsibility.\n\n“If companies do not optimise the introduction of AI over a longer horizon and do not handle it with sensitivity, the demand for policy intervention and the demand on fiscal resources to compensate will be irresistible,” it said.\n\n“A robust future roadmap must prioritise industry-academia partnerships, continuous skill development, and flexible learning models to create a globally competitive workforce. Several key areas require focused attention and strategic intervention to achieve this vision of a robust skilling ecosystem,” it added.\n\nArguing that each revolution has displaced large segments of the workforce and led to economic disparity, the Survey said that “protracted labour displacement is something that a labour-surplus country like India cannot afford”.\n\n“Our primary challenge is the challenge of numbers. As highlighted in the Economic Survey 2023-24, India would have to create an average of 78.5 lakh jobs annually in the non-farm sector by 2030 to cater to the rising workforce. Further, India is a majorly services driven economy, with a significant share of the I.T. workforce employed in low value added services. Such jobs are the most susceptible to automation, as firms in a bid to cut costs may substitute labour for technology,” the Survey said.\n\n“India is also a consumption based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country’s economic growth trajectory off course,” it added.\n\nLooking ahead, the Survey said, the country’s predominantly services-driven economy, coupled with its young and dynamic population, offers a fertile ground for leveraging the benefits of emerging technologies, only if proactively and carefully managed.",
