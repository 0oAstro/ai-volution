    "raw_text": "Intel is effectively killing Falcon Shores, its next-generation GPU for high-performance computing and AI workloads.\n\nThe move comes as Intel tries to correct course after a number of disappointing product launches and historic losses, while competitors like AMD and Nvidia gain ground.\n\nIntel co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus said during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday that Intel will \u201cleverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip, without bringing it to market.\u201d\n\n\u201cAI data center \u2026 is an attractive market for us,\u201d Holthaus said during the call. \u201c[B]ut I am not happy with where we are today. We\u2019re not yet participating in the cloud-based AI data center market in a meaningful way \u2026 One of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our roadmap and concentrate our resources.\u201d\n\nThe focus instead will be on Jaguar Shores, which Holthaus called Intel\u2019s opportunity to \u201cdevelop a system-level solution at rack scale \u2026 to address the AI data center more broadly.\u201d\n\nHolthaus tempered expectations for Falcon Shores last month, when she implied that it was an \u201citerative\u201d step over the company\u2019s previous dedicated AI data center chip, Gaudi 3.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we\u2019ve learned from Gaudi is, it\u2019s not enough to just deliver the silicon,\u201d Holthaus said during Thursday\u2019s earnings call. \u201cFalcon Shores will help us in that process of working on the system, networking, memory \u2014 all those component[s]. But what customers really want is that full-scale rack solution, and so we\u2019re able to get to that with Jaguar Shores.\u201d\n\nGaudi 3 is widely seen as a miss for Intel. In November, the company said it would be unable to meet its goal of $500 million in Gaudi 3 sales due to software-related issues. Today, few major service providers beyond IBM have committed to using the chip.\n\nIntel faces an uphill battle in the AI data center chip space. Rival AMD expects to make around $7 billion in AI chip revenue in 2025, while Nvidia, the incumbent to beat, could hit $195 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, according to some analysts.\n\n\u201cAs I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably the need to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute,\u201d Holthaus said. \u201cAs such, a one-size-fits-all approach will not work, and I can see clear opportunities to leverage our core assets in new ways to drive the most compelling total cost of ownership across the continuum.\u201d",

This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year. There\u2019s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.\n\nThe voluntary severance program arrives just under a year after Google merged the Android, Pixel hardware, and Chrome teams into a single \u201cPlatform and Devices\u201d division, overseen by Osterloh.\n\nThe executive noted in April that the re-org was a bid to integrate the company\u2019s AI offerings more deeply into its products. In the intervening months, Google\u2019s generative AI platform, Gemini, has grown into an outsized presence among its hardware and software offerings.\n\nGemini took center stage earlier this month as Samsung unveiled its flagship Galaxy S25 smartphone. The service has also been central to Google\u2019s own hardware devices, effectively replacing the Home Assistant on Pixel products. Google Home, meanwhile, continues to play a role in the company\u2019s Nest line of smart home hardware.\n\nThe exit program applies to a wide range of Google offerings, including Android, Chrome/ChromeOS, Fitbit, Google One, Nest, Photos, and Pixel. Other large Google divisions, including AI and search, are not directly impacted.",

    "raw_text": "Cushion, a fintech startup that described itself as the \u201cPlaid for buy now, pay later (BNPL),\u201d has shut down.\n\nOn Thursday, founder and CEO Paul Kesserwani posted on LinkedIn about the decision to wind down the company at the end of 2024.\n\nIn the post, Kesserwani said that \u201cdespite bringing multiple new fintech products to market,\u201d Cushion \u201cdidn\u2019t reach the scale needed to sustain the business.\u201d\n\nFounded in late 2016, San Francisco-based Cushion had raised a total of $21.6 million from investors such as Afore Capital, Flourish Ventures, Vestigo Ventures, Better Tomorrow Ventures, and 500 Global.\n\nIts last publicly announced raise was in May, 2022 when it closed a $12 million Series A. Its post-money valuation in 2022 was $82.4 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nKesserwani did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\n\nCushion offered a consumer app that sucked in the transaction history from its users\u2019 bank accounts, determined what fees had been assessed and then conducted negotiations on their behalf to get a refund. It was designed, Kesserwani told TechCrunch in 2019, to be incentive-aligned with consumers by only taking a commission on any returned cash.\n\nKesserwani got the idea for Cushion after leaving his job at Twitter. While taking some time off to think about what he wanted to do next, he was helping his parents manage their bank accounts while they were traveling for work in Lebanon. Due to bank security policies, his parents weren\u2019t able to log into their accounts from Lebanon, and eventually, they faced a mountain of banking fees as their accounts went unattended. As Kesserwani investigated, he turned to his own accounts, and realized he had also been paying fees to the tune of $400 that he had no memory of agreeing to.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s LinkedIn post, Kesserwani said that Cushion had automated bank fee negotiation and reached $3 million ARR in 10 months and processed over $300 million in BNPL loans. He added that the company had onboarded over 1 million consumers over time, with more than 200,000 paying customers.\n\nWrote Kesserwani: \u201cI gave Cushion everything I had for 8+ years. While the outcome wasn\u2019t what we hoped for, we built something that moved the industry forward \u2014 and I\u2019m proud of that. As for me, I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nData suggests that 2025 is expected to be another brutal year for startup shutdowns. In late December, another fintech \u2014 Bench \u2014 shut down abruptly only to be acquired days later.\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech here.",

    "raw_text": "Martin Fengler knows a lot about the weather. Fengler got his PhD in mathematics, focused on numerical weather prediction, before working for Meteomedia AG, a network of weather stations in Switzerland and Germany. But while he knew a lot about weather forecasting from the prediction side, he realized the gaps that remained on the consumption side when he started working toward his pilot\u2019s license in 2011.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot about weather forecasting from a user perspective,\u201d Fengler told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s, of course, much different than looking to the weather forecast as a mathematician and minimizing error measures. But sitting at an airstrip and you can\u2019t fly because of fog or a bad forecast, that was quite eye opening.\u201d\n\nFengler decided to launch a weather company of his own, and started Meteomatics in 2012. The St. Gallen, Switzerland-based company pulls weather data from more than 110 sources in addition to gathering data from its own autonomous weather drones. This combination of data sources allows Meteomatics to update its weather forecasts every hour and make precise predictions for areas as small as one square kilometer.\n\nMeteomatics puts all that information into one place and built an API on top of it so its customers can use the data how they see fit, including running their own AI algorithms on top of it. Fengler, CEO, added that the fact that Meteomatics translates weather data into one uniform structure seems simple but is a feat of its own.\n\n\u201cIt was dealing with complicated large files, data formats that are very specific to these industries, there is little standard around that,\u201d Fengler said. \u201cBringing APIs to this industry was like bringing the light to the blind.\u201d\n\nFengler said this focus on building a weather company aimed at enterprises, or the commercial sector in general, sets it apart from most weather companies because many are focused on one area and one audience.\n\n\u201cMost weather companies have a focus on the media industry and I didn\u2019t like that,\u201d Fengler said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much about TV and radio, but there\u2019s a huge demand from industry, and I was always intrigued by the topics those customers are dealing with.\u201d\n\nMeteomatics now works with more than 600 customers, including large enterprises like Tesla, CVS Health, and Swiss Re, among others. Fengler added that while some enterprise use cases for Meteomatics are more obvious, like a renewable energy company using weather data to predict outcomes from their wind or solar farms, others are less so, and Fengler said he learns of a new enterprise use cases for weather data almost every week.\n\nEnterprises will likely increasingly look for this kind of data too as the impacts of climate change continue to get more intense. Climate disasters cost $150 billion a year, in the U.S. alone, with businesses shouldering a percentage of those costs.\n\nMeteomatics just raised a $22 million Series C round led by Armira Growth with participation from Alantra\u2019s energy transition fund, Klima, and FortyOne Group, among others. Fengler said that the company has intentionally reinvested the money it\u2019s made back into the business over its 12-year history which has allowed the startup to avoid raising a ton of capital.\n\nFengler added that they usually raise a new round when they are looking to put money toward a specific project or initiative. This Series C round is no different, as the company plans to use the capital to work on its U.S. expansion by hiring a sales and marketing team focused on the region.\n\nSome of the money from the round will also be put toward building out the company\u2019s tech. Fengler\u2019s grand vision is to bring precision weather, defined as down to a one-square kilometer range, to the whole globe. This level of specificity is currently available across Europe and should be available in the U.S. by the end of Q1.\n\n\u201cThat remains the North Star for Meteomatics,\u201d Fengler said. \u201cIt makes me get up in the morning. I strongly believe that we will be able to deliver a global one-kilometer model one day.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "For nearly nine years, Elon Musk has promised Tesla vehicles had the hardware needed to support a self-driving car. This week, he made his latest admission that many are not.\n\nMusk said on a conference call Wednesday evening that Tesla cars equipped with so-called Hardware 3 will need an upgrade before they can support unsupervised self-driving software the automaker is still developing. These Hardware 3 vehicles, sold between 2019 and 2023, are equipped with the older version of the computer that powers the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised)\u201d driver assistance software.\n\n\u201cI think the honest answer is that we\u2019re going to have to upgrade people\u2019s Hardware 3 computer for those that have bought Full Self-Driving,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be painful and difficult, but we\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\nThis is not surprising to anyone who has followed the company\u2019s progress closely.\n\nBroadly, Musk has repeatedly overpromised on Tesla\u2019s timeline for selling a vehicle that can drive autonomously without human intervention. But the company has now repeatedly capitulated on its 2016 claim that every car it was building had the hardware required to one day fully drive itself with the flip of a switch \u2014 an unfulfilled promise that has been central to Tesla\u2019s valuation for years. (Tesla has since deleted that blog post from its website.)\n\nTesla made that claim in October 2016, several months after it parted ways with Mobileye, which provided the original computer for its Autopilot driver assistance software. Tesla dubbed its initial in-house hardware \u2014 the hardware that it was referencing in the 2016 announcement \u2014 \u201cHardware 2.0.\u201d One year later it started integrating a \u201cHardware 2.5\u201d computer.\n\nNeither of those computers were up to the task, though, evidenced by the fact that when Tesla started shipping cars with a \u201cHardware 3\u201d computer in 2019, owners with older hardware had to upgrade to this new computer in order to buy the supervised Full Self-Driving software. Tesla initially charged for this upgrade, but one owner took the company to small claims court and got a judge to rule that Tesla\u2019s 2016 promise was \u201cfalse advertising,\u201d and that the upgrades should be free.\n\nTesla has since moved on to building cars with \u201cHardware 4\u201d computers, which had some owners wondering what that meant for Hardware 3-equipped cars. Musk and other Tesla executives had said they believed they could develop software that would enable Hardware 3 cars to drive themselves unsupervised, and one even repeated that claim on Wednesday. But Musk followed up by saying he\u2019d given up.\n\nHis admission on Wednesday only further emphasizes that Tesla and Musk were wrong when they made that infamous proclamation in 2016.\n\nMusk was unequivocal and defiant at the time, too, going so far as saying that the media was \u201ckilling people\u201d by writing \u201cnegative\u201d articles about crashes involving Tesla\u2019s driver assistance system, Autopilot. \u201cYou effectively dissuade people from using an autonomous vehicle,\u201d he said on a conference call in 2016, a time when fully autonomous vehicles did not exist.\n\nThat is not the case today, as Waymo operates a commercial robotaxi service in multiple cities.",

    "raw_text": "Indonesia\u2019s antitrust agency KPPU fined Google 202.5 billion Rupiahs, equivalent to $12.6 million, on Wednesday for antitrust violation related to its payment system services for the Google Play Store.\n\nThe KPPU ordered the search giant to cease the mandatory use of Google Play Billing in the Google Play Store. It also asked Google to let all developers participate in the User Choice Billing (UCB) program and give them a minimum 5% service fee discount for a year after the decision is finalized, according to its statement.\n\nThe antitrust watchdog launched an investigation into Google in 2022 for its market dominance \u2014 in particular, the company required Indonesian app developers to use Google Play Billing (GPB). The agency found that the Google Play Billing system had charged fees up to 30%, higher than other payment systems.\n\nThe Google Play Store handles payments between developers and users through the GPB System for in-app purchases. Google requires all purchases of digital products and services in the Google Play Store to go through the Google Play Billing system. At the same time, it prohibits other payment alternatives to Google Play Billing. The agency said that limiting the payment options led to fewer app users, reduced transactions and lower revenue.\n\nThe agency noted that the Google Play Store is the only app store pre-installed on all Android devices, with a market share over 50%. As for the search engine market, Google held a market share of 95.16% in the Indonesian search market, and other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo!, DuckDuckGo, and Yandex held the rest as of January 2024, according to Statista.\n\nGoogle plans to appeal the ruling.\n\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the KPPU\u2019s decision and will appeal. Our current practices foster a healthy, competitive Indonesian app ecosystem, offering a secure platform, global reach, and choice, including user choice billing \u2014 which enables alternatives to Google Play\u2019s billing system,\u201d a Google spokesperson, Danielle Cohen, said in an email statement.\n\n\u201cBeyond our platform, we actively support Indonesian developers through a comprehensive suite of initiatives, including Indie Games Accelerator, Play Academy, and Play x Unity, reflecting our deep investment in their success. We remain committed to complying with Indonesian law and will continue collaborating with the KPPU and stakeholders throughout the appeals process,\u201d she added.",

    "raw_text": "American teens have lost their faith in Big Tech, according to a new report from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit offering reviews and ratings for media and technology, which more recently includes AI products.\n\nIn the study released Wednesday, the organization surveyed over 1,000 teens on whether major technology companies like Google, Apple, Meta, TikTok, and Microsoft cared about their well-being and safety, made ethical decisions, protected their private data, and more. In all cases, a majority of teens reported low levels of trust in these tech companies. Nearly half of teens said they had little or no trust that the companies would make responsible decisions about how they use AI.\n\nDistrust in Big Tech has been building in the U.S. for years, from the 2013 revelation of the government\u2019s mass data collection, to the data scandal involving consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, to the 2021 Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen\u2019s leaks indicating Meta was aware of its harms on society, to the multiple Congressional hearings where lawmakers grilled Big Tech CEOs over app safety, antitrust issues, and harmful algorithms.\n\nThis year, tech CEOs lined up to pledge allegiance to the Trump administration in the form of $1 million donations to the president\u2019s inaugural fund, hoping to buy favor and avoid scrutiny and regulation of their businesses \u2014 no matter the cost to their users. (Even for those aligned with Trump, the tech leaders\u2019 actions are seen as disingenuous, given how they\u2019ve flip-flopped after previously criticizing Trump in his earlier term.)\n\nWhile teens may or may not track these tech news headlines as closely as their adult counterparts, this overall shift in sentiment is affecting them, too.\n\nCommon Sense says that 64% of surveyed U.S. teens don\u2019t trust Big Tech companies to care about their mental health and well-being and 62% don\u2019t think the companies will protect their safety if it hurts profits.\n\nOver half of surveyed U.S. teens (53%) also don\u2019t think major tech companies make ethical and responsible design decisions (think: the growing use of dark patterns in user interface design meant to trick, confuse, and deceive.\n\nA further 52% don\u2019t think that Big Tech will keep their personal information safe and 51% don\u2019t think the companies are fair and inclusive when considering the needs of different users.\n\nNot surprisingly, the mistrust in tech is influencing teens\u2019 opinions around AI, too, as 47% of those surveyed don\u2019t believe these companies will make responsible decisions over their use of AI.\n\nThe new study builds on Common Sense\u2019s prior research about the adoption of generative AI among teens and also focuses on how GenAI is impacting the larger media landscape.\n\nFor instance, it found that 41% of surveyed teens reported being misled by fake images online, 35% were misled by fake online content in general, and over a quarter (28%) wondered if they were talking to a bot or a human. A third of teens also said that GenAI would make it even harder to trust the accuracy of online information. That figure rises to 40% if the teens had previously been duped by fake or misleading content.\n\nOverall, the report points to a lack of uncertainty over online content, though that\u2019s hardly a new problem for the web.\n\nStill, it seems that AI isn\u2019t helping the matter despite AI chatbots\u2019 authoritative answers. Some 39% of surveyed teens noticed problems with AI\u2019s output when using it for schoolwork help. Plus, a majority of surveyed U.S. teens (74%) said privacy safeguards and transparency are needed to manage AI, 74% said AI companies should discourage people from sharing personal information on their platform, and 73% of teens said AI images and other content should be labeled and watermarked.\n\nWhen weighing in on the business models of AI, 61% of teens felt that content creators should be compensated when their data is used by AI systems.\n\nAs a result of teens\u2019 lack of trust and the fast pace of AI development, 35% of teens think GenAI will make it harder to trust online information \u2014 though that number could change in time.",

While the company was short on details as to what specific changes lay in store, it\u2019s clear that Meta is in desperate need of younger Facebook users to sustain itself for the next generation.\n\nAsked about his plans for the \u201cOG Facebook,\u201d Zuckerberg replied that it was one of Meta\u2019s focus areas for the year ahead and something the company planned to both invest in and spend time on.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of opportunities to make [Facebook] way more culturally influential than it is today,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe exec also warned investors that these changes to Facebook may require some tradeoffs in terms of \u201cmaximizing business results in the near term\u201d \u2014 a signal that revenues could be affected. He said the product changes would begin to roll out within half a year or so.\n\n\u201cI think some of this will kind of get back to how Facebook was originally used back in the day,\u201d Zuckerberg said, while tight-lipped on any other details.\n\nDeclining interest in Facebook among young people is becoming a problem for the tech giant, especially as its core adult users continue to age.\n\nAccording to a study by eMarketer released last August, U.S. Gen Z users ages 18 to 24 spend far more time on TikTok, followed by Instagram and Snapchat \u2014 twice as much time, in fact, compared with the total U.S. adult population. Meanwhile, a 2024 survey by Pew Research found that U.S. teens\u2019 (13-17) use of Facebook had dropped sharply over the years from 71% in 2014-2015 to just 33%.\n\nOften, what appeals to Gen Z isn\u2019t even the social networking aspects of Facebook; it\u2019s the more utilitarian features like Facebook Marketplace.\n\nMeta has long been aware of these challenges, having launched a Gen Z-focused redesign of its aging social network in October 2024, promising greater emphasis on local community information, videos, and Facebook Groups, among other things.\n\nThe company now aims to build on those changes with a further refresh of the Facebook product in 2025, though its ability to compete with Gen Z\u2019s preferred app, TikTok, remains uncertain.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Gen Z users have sent a strong signal that they\u2019re ready to move on from Meta, if TikTok were to remain banned in the U.S. Instead of returning to Meta\u2019s platform, young people downloaded RedNote, another Chinese app similar to TikTok, ahead of and during the briefly enforced U.S. TikTok ban.\n\nIt may be difficult, if not impossible, for Facebook to ever again attract younger users by returning to its \u201cOG\u201d roots. The company had already tried to reignite its original feeling of exclusivity by launching a side of Facebook called Campus in 2020 that only catered to college and university students. That effort was shuttered a year and a half later after failing to take off.\n\nMeta has also dabbled in using other services, like online dating, to lure in new users, with little success.\n\nMeanwhile, new social networks are being built on the open social web, powered by protocols like ActivityPub, used by Mastodon, and AT Protocol, used by Bluesky, allowing people to take back control over their data and social connections from the centralized, billionaire-controlled platforms owned by Big Tech. As these networks grow, they\u2019ll become competition for efforts like an \u201cOG Facebook.\u201d\n\nMeta has been working to shield investors from Facebook\u2019s decline for years.\n\nIn Q4 2019, Meta (then called Facebook) introduced new stats for investors called family daily active people and family monthly active people. Later, in Q1 2024, Meta took steps to distance itself from per-app metrics by eliminating daily active and monthly active users in its quarterly reports in favor of its family of apps\u2019 metrics.",

    "raw_text": "Safety is often overlooked in the rush to bring humanoid robots to the workplace. As high-profile corporations ranging from retailers like Amazon to carmakers such as Mercedes and BMW have announced humanoid pilots for factories and warehouses, conversations around worker safety are regularly buried beneath industry hype.\n\nOne Bay Area robotics firm is hoping to correct that shortfall.\n\nFigure AI announced Tuesday it is building a Center for the Advancement of Humanoid Safety, an in-house division wholly focused on the topic. Rob Gruendel, the former Amazon Robotics safety engineer who is heading up the project, revealed the plans via a LinkedIn post.\n\nEarlier factory and warehouse systems addressed the safety problem by caging in big, heavy robots. Subsequent solutions have turned to technology, including advanced computer vision, software developed by Veo Robotics, and a safety vest designed by Amazon to help keep robots from crashing into people.\n\nAmazon\u2019s wearable is designed solely for internal usage and likely won\u2019t appear outside of its own fulfillment centers. Even with that technology, the company still uses protective cages for many of its robots. Veo Robotics, meanwhile, was absorbed into Symbotic in 2024. More recently, Symbotic has taken the reins of Walmart\u2019s robotics division.\n\nWhile valued for its adaptability, multi-purpose functionality, and ability to integrate into existing brownfield warehouses, the humanoid form factor introduces a new set of safety concerns. After all, one of the category\u2019s key selling points is its ability to work alongside humans. Their big, metal bodies \u2014 ranging freely inside factories and warehouses \u2014 have the potential to cause injuries by colliding with their softer, fleshier colleagues.\n\nWorkplace safety organizations like Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have a lot of catching up to do in terms of automation safety regulation. Today there are no \u201cspecific OSHA standards for the robotics industry,\u201d according to the federal agency. This broader concern needs to be addressed, but regulation specifically targeting humanoids is especially timely.\n\nFigure AI is homing in on that gap.\n\n\u201cOne of our recent successes was to finalize a formal plan with our OSHA recognized independent testing laboratory to certify our robot\u2019s battery, functional safety control system, and electrical system to industrial standards,\u201d Gruendel noted in the announcement post.\n\nFetch founder, Melonee Wise, has made the topic of humanoid safety a key focus since joining Agility Robotics as chief technology officer in 2023.\n\n\u201cWith any humanoid robot operating in this space, safety is not clear,\u201d Wise told me during a humanoids panel at last year\u2019s Automate conference. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an easy stop for [Tesla\u2019s] Optimus. There isn\u2019t a stop on many [humanoid robots], and that is against the safety standard. It\u2019s very clear that many of the companies are not interested in it.\u201d\n\nThe creation of the Center for the Advancement of Humanoid Safety is an important step on that journey for Figure.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the general population is often at the mercy of the technology experts to judge whether an AI-controlled robot can be safe,\u201d Gruendel wrote. \u201cWe want to speak directly with our customers. We will test and communicate the robot\u2019s stability while stationary, stability while moving, detection of humans, detection of four-legged pets, safe AI behaviors, and navigation to prevent injury. We will listen to suggestions from our customers on ways to test the safety of Figure 02 and beyond.\u201d\n\nFigure plans to publish quarterly updates offering more transparency around the process. The reports will include testing procedures and fixes for potential hazards.\n\n\u201cWe will summarize our successes and failures,\u201d according to Gruendel.\n\nThose successes and failures could eventually close the gap on safety and prepare the industry for the next big leap: bringing robots into the home.\n\nHumanoid safety standards are set to become increasingly essential as more firms push to bring these robots into the home.",

TechCrunch has reached out to the firm for comment.\n\nSince its founding 10 years ago, 8VC has invested in over 600 companies, including Asana, Flexport, hims and hers, and Elon Musk\u2019s The Boring Company, according to PitchBook data. However, given Lonsdale\u2019s defense roots, the firm\u2019s investments in the sector have drawn the most attention.\n\nIn 2022, 8VC was a seed investor in Saronic, a manufacturer of robotic boat drones that can also gather surveillance and reconnaissance. Since then, the company has closed two rounds and is currently in talks to raise $500 million at a $3 billion valuation, Forbes reported.\n\n8VC\u2019s other defense tech investments include Overland AI, a startup that\u2019s developing autonomous vehicles for defense and national security applications. When Overland raised a $32 million Series A earlier this month, Lonsdale told Axios that the company is in a position to become the \u201cnext great defense prime.\u201d\n\nAnother big area of focus for the firm is health tech and life sciences, representing over a quarter of 8VC deals, including the now publicly traded biotechs Senti Bio and Vir.\n\nLonsdale moved 8VC from Silicon Valley to Austin in 2020 because he felt the city was more tolerant of \u201cideological diversity.\u201c\n\nAlthough Lonsdale is not technically a member of the PayPal mafia, he was an intern at the company for two summers.

The BKA called them \u201cthe world\u2019s two largest trading platforms for cybercrime on the internet,\u201d according to a machine translation of the BKA\u2019s press release.\n\nConfirmation of the operation comes a day after cybersecurity experts noticed that Cracked, Nulled, as well as two other sites called Sellix and StarkRDP, appeared to have been seized by redirecting the domains\u2019 nameservers to servers run by the FBI. The four sites later displayed a banner announcing the law enforcement action, dubbed \u201cOperation Talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese sites worked as one-stop shops and were used not only for discussions on cybercrime but also as marketplaces for illegal goods and cybercrime-as-a-service, such as stolen data, malware or hacking tools,\u201d Europol wrote in its press release.\n\nAn announcement published on Wednesday on Cracked\u2019s official Telegram channel said the site had been seized \u201cwith specific reasons being undisclosed.\u201d\n\nEuropol said the operation took place between Tuesday and Thursday and resulted in two arrests, seven properties searched, and the seizure of 17 servers, 50 electronic devices, and \u20ac300,000 ($313,000) in cash and cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the BKA, the law enforcement coalition seized a dozen accounts and domains across 10 countries. Also, 12 people were identified as being involved in operating the cybercrime platforms.

    "raw_text": "Many nonprofits are stuck with outdated, expensive, and limited tech that hinders their ability to fund their mission or cause. While most consider adopting tech to be a priority, they\u2019re faced with a number of blockers, including siloed data and issues with integration.\n\nPeter Byrnes, the co-founder of Fundraise Up, a Brooklyn-based fundraising platform for nonprofits, says that the result is often a poor donor experience.\n\n\u201cThe nonprofit\u2019s messaging is about affecting change, making a difference, and being a hero,\u201d Byrnes told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cBut when a would-be donor arrives to the donation form, the experience is a complete 180. They don\u2019t feel empowered \u2014 they feel frustrated.\u201d\n\nByrnes founded Fundraise Up in 2017 with Anton Isaykin and Yuriy Smirnov. Previously, the trio co-founded Campus on Fire, a software development firm focused on creating peer-to-peer marketplaces.\n\nUsing Fundraise Up, nonprofits can add a \u201cDonate Now\u201d button to their website, or create a dedicated campaign page. The platform offers features to help manage fundraising drives, keep track of donation stats, and accept different forms of payment.\n\nThere are plenty of donation tools for nonprofits out there, including Give Lively, Zeffy, and Funraise. So why would a nonprofit want Fundraise Up?\n\nWell, according to Byrnes, Fundraise Up deeply incorporates AI into its offerings, enabling it to do more than the average tool. For example, the platform can tailor donation suggestions to individual donors, \u201cintelligently\u201d recommend that donors upgrade to recurring donations, and offer options when a donor is about to cancel.\n\n\u201cOur platform is designed to remove donor friction and alleviate the burden shouldered by nonprofits,\u201d Byrnes said. \u201cWhile competitors are now waking up to the transformational power of AI, our models and dataset give us a great advantage over those who incorporate AI at a later stage.\u201d\n\nByrnes also claims that Fundraise Up\u2019s pricing model is attractive \u2014 and highly competitive. Unlike some platforms, Fundraise Up doesn\u2019t charge customers upfront. Nonprofits pay a 4% fee per transaction (plus payment processor fees), and receive technical support for free.\n\n\u201cThe problem with lock-in contracts \u2014 the go-to model for legacy providers \u2014 is that nonprofits are paying upfront for a service before seeing any result,\u201d Byrnes said. \u201cIf they have a challenging year, they still have to pay the fees. For us, we don\u2019t see a penny until we deliver.\u201d\n\nFundraise Up\u2019s strategy certainly seems to be working well for it. More than 3,000 nonprofit organizations are using the platform today, according to Byrnes, including the Canadian Red Cross, the American Heart Association, and The Salvation Army UK.\n\nTo fund its expansion, Fundraise Up raised $70 million this month in a minority growth investment led by Summit Partners with participation from existing investor Telescope Partners. Bringing the startup\u2019s total raised to over $80 million, the new cash will be put toward product development and bringing Fundraise Up to new markets and verticals.\n\n\u201cAs of recent macro trends, the giving market continues to be a rapidly growing, yet resilient, opportunity,\u201d Byrnes said. \u201cWith our raise, Fundraise Up aims to amplify that momentum, and solidify its position as a market leader \u2014 and as a fundraising platform that delivers on innovation and positive impact to nonprofit missions.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "Four years after launching the (then) most lucrative crowdfunding campaign in Kickstarter\u2019s history, smartwatch maker Pebble abruptly closed in 2016, filing for insolvency before being sold off to rival Fitbit. The fitness-tracking giant went on to build much of its Ionic smartwatch with help from former Pebblers, along with Pebble\u2019s pioneering software stack.\n\nIt could be argued that Pebble was simply too early to the space. The Apple Watch launched in mid-2015 and proceeded to suck much of the oxygen out of the room. It would be massively oversimplifying the situation to suggest that it was merely another case of Sherlocking, however. Apple, after all, raised public interest, ultimately setting the stage for countless other smartwatches after.\n\nIn fact, founder and CEO Eric Migicovsky believes instead that the company\u2019s rapid growth and feature expansion caused Pebble \u2014 which sold 2 million smartwatches \u2014 to lose sight of his initial vision. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first time a hardware startup was felled by such fate.\n\nYet Migicovsky is ready for round two. \u201cWe\u2019re restarting Pebble,\u201d he told TechCrunch with a massive grin on a Zoom call Monday. How, exactly? While Pebble branding faded after the company was bought, its acquirer, Fitbit, was itself sold off to Google in 2021.\n\nNow Google, which still owns the technology and all of Pebble\u2019s IP, plans to open source the smartwatch brand\u2019s software stack.\n\n\u201cThis is part of an effort from Google to help and support the volunteers who have come together to maintain functionality for Pebble watches after the original company ceased operations in 2016,\u201d Google wrote in a blog post on Monday.\n\nBy open sourcing access to PebbleOS, Google is opening the door to new third-party hardware, and Migicovsky\u2019s smartwatch startup is first on that list.\n\nIt\u2019s still in the idea stage, he says. The company needs a new name \u2014 something the Beeper co-founder and former Y Combinator partner hasn\u2019t quite gotten around to. But he tells TechCrunch that he has thrown himself into the project full time and will be able to accelerate things as access to PebbleOS opens up. He is currently its only employee, but there are plans to bring on another around March.\n\nThe startup\u2019s goals are fittingly humble. Migicovsky says he simply wants to make the watch he wants, given that the Pebble he wears to this day is now a decade old. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything else,\u201d he says. \u201cI have very high standards.\u201d\n\nThose are, according to a new blog post on Migicovsky\u2019s personal site:\n\nAlways-on e-paper screen (it\u2019s reflective rather than emissive. Sunlight readable. Glanceable. Not distracting to others like a bright wrist)\n\nLong battery life (one less thing to charge. It\u2019s annoying to need extra cables when traveling)\n\nSimple and beautiful user experience around a core set of features I use regularly (telling time, notifications, music control, alarms, weather, calendar, sleep/step tracking)\n\nButtons! (to play/pause/skip music on my phone without looking at the screen)\n\nHackable (apparently you can\u2019t even write your own watch faces for Apple Watch? That is wild. There were >16k watch faces on the Pebble app store!)\n\nIn spite of his time at YC, Migicovsky has no plan to raise VC funds. Nor does he plan to return to the Kickstarter model that gave rise to Pebble . He is currently self-funding the project and says he plans to build it modestly, based on consumer interest.\n\nAs for whether an audience remains for Pebble in a post-Apple Watch world, he jokes, \u201cThere are at least dozens of us.\u201d He notes that the brand still commands its own active Subreddit, eight years after closing its doors. A small resale market has popped up around older devices, though as anyone who has bought a piece of consumer electronics in the past two decades can tell you, hardware doesn\u2019t last forever.\n\nMigicovsky expects the company to serve the specific needs of those who want precisely what he laid out in his blog post. It\u2019s difficult to say how many people yearn for the discontinued product in a world where Apple has dramatically shifted user expectations, but he\u2019s betting on not being alone in his desires.\n\n\u201cThis is a passion project. I have a vested interest in making the watch,\u201d Migicovsky says of building a startup to create a product he wants to wear. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make this happen.\u201d\n\nDespite being in its infancy, Migicovsky has visited Shenzhen in a bid to scope out the current state of manufacturing. \u201cTurns out making hardware is much easier than it was 10 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were no smartwatches factories. We had to tell the factories what to do.\u201d\n\nHe also says that he feels confident about the small startup\u2019s ability to build a new Pebble for the current era. \u201cThe hard part is the software.\u201d\n\nBy opening up PebbleOS, Google made that bit considerably easier.",

While Nintendo didn\u2019t reveal anything in the way of specs for the forthcoming Switch 2 platform, the gaming giant showed off what appears to be the first game confirmed for the hybrid platform: a new take on the racing classic, Mario Kart.\n\nAfter all, it wouldn\u2019t be a proper Nintendo launch without a familiar face. Much like the hardware, however, details on the game are next to nothing. The trailer showcased some very basic gameplay that will prove familiar to anyone who has played an installment of the franchise at some point in the last 30+ years.\n\nIf set to launch late this year, it would arrive five years after Mario Kart Live was released for the console\u2019s predecessor. That, in turn, would mark the 16th main entry to the series, which launched for the Super Nintendo in 1992.\n\nThe original Switch, meanwhile, launched in 2017, with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild serving as the flagship title. The open-world Zelda game, much like the Switch itself, received rave reviews from critics. A sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was released in 2023 to nearly universal praise.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the Switch 2 has more than a little in common with its predecessor, which has sold roughly 150 units since launch. We also know that the new hybrid will be backward-compatible with the Switch\u2019s gaming library.\n\nThose looking for additional information on the new platform will have to wait until April 2, when the company broadcasts the first Nintendo Direct focused on the new console.",

    "raw_text": "It can be challenging for developers of fintech apps to integrate repayment, balance transfer, and bill pay functionality. Devs often have to deal with a patchwork of brittle screen-scraping APIs to extract data from users\u2019 financial institutions \u2014 or worse, tools to process mounds of physical checks and paperwork.\n\nThree friends and entrepreneurs \u2014 Jose Bethancourt, Marco del Carmen, and Mit Shah \u2014 told TechCrunch that the blockers can be dealbreaking, particularly for smaller fintech teams. To attempt to overcome them \u2014 and help others do the same \u2014 the trio launched Method, a platform that powers debt and debt repayment features in fintech applications.\n\n\u201cJose and Marco experienced firsthand the challenges of financial account connectivity while building their first company, GradJoy, a Y Combinator-backed startup,\u201d Shah told TechCrunch. \u201cGradJoy aimed to simplify student loan management, but Jose and Marco quickly realized the limitations of existing account connectivity systems.\u201d\n\nMethod works by leveraging consumer credit access protections enacted into law as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. By tapping into identity verification data from credit bureaus and telecom companies and combining it with data from core banking systems, Method can aggregate a person\u2019s debts and execute balance transfers, bill pay, and payoffs and on their behalf.\n\nFintech developers can build the tech into their apps using Method\u2019s API. All a user of those apps has to do is provide their phone number.\n\nMethod, which emerged from stealth in 2021, now supports over 30 million account connections for 4 million users, and has facilitated over $500 million in liability repayments to date.\n\nMethod handles a lot of sensitive data, which might give some users pause. But Shah claims that Method collects only \u201cminimum user information\u201d and doesn\u2019t sell data to third parties. The company is also planning to launch a portal where users will be able to log in to manage data they\u2019ve shared with Method customers.\n\nMethod competes with big vendors like Plaid, MX, Spinwheel, and Dwolla. But many of these rely on systems that require users to enter their financial account credentials, Shah said, which he argued can be a point of friction.\n\n\u201cMethod is supporting millions of Americans on their financial journeys while helping lenders and fintechs like SoFi, Aven, Happy Money, and Figure increase conversion with better user experience and engagement,\u201d Shah continued. \u201cConsumers do not have to re-authenticate multiple times for different accounts, and once Method retrieves a consumer\u2019s liabilities, they can pay those liabilities using Method\u2019s payment rail.\u201d\n\nMethod recently added support for credit cards; it underpins Bilt\u2019s credit card linking tool, which lets Bilt customers connect their cards to receive points on eligible purchases. In the near future, Method plans to deepen its banking relationships and roll out credit card network integrations for retail and travel customers.\n\n\u201cMany shoppers aren\u2019t comfortable storing their card details or are unwilling to take the time,\u201d Shah said. \u201cMethod presents guests and repeat shoppers with their current credit card wallet \u2014 including each and every active credit card they hold \u2014 just with the entry of their name and phone number. With Method\u2019s solution, the merchant has greater influence over the checkout experience and can better understand customers across channels and cards with the full wallet visibility.\u201d\n\nTo fund this product growth, 35-employee, Austin-based Method raised a $41.5 million Series B round led by Emergence Capital with participation from Avra Capital, Samsung Next, Andreessen Horowitz, Y Combinator, and Ardent. The new cash brings the company\u2019s total raised to ~$60 million.",

The fresh cash will help the company extend its runway through 2026 and scale its fleet from the 100 robots on the streets of Los Angeles today to the 2,000 Serve hopes to deploy by the end of 2025 in multiple U.S. cities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not taking more money to just burn through it in the next year,\u201d Serve CFO Brian Read told TechCrunch. \u201cThis is the long-term coffer to help us as we get beyond these 2,000 robots.\u201d\n\nThe new capital, which came from unnamed institutional investors, comes in the wake of $86 million in gross proceeds that Serve had raised in December 2024 through a combination of a filed at-the-market facility and an exercise of warrants. The startup has raised a total of over $247 million in the past 12 months.\n\nServe, which went public in April 2024 via a reverse merger, expects the $80 million offering to close on Tuesday. Serve wouldn\u2019t say what it intends to use the cash for specifically, only noting that it would go toward working capital to build the business and deploy robots.\n\nRead did note that Serve intends to use its cash reserves for self-funding equipment investments that will help it eliminate the need for equipment financing and associated servicing costs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get our cost of capital as low as possible, and the best way [previously] for us to do that was to finance our robots, which comes with interest costs and deposits and cash locked up and security interests on the hardware,\u201d Read said. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved past that now, so we get better cash flow. We have ownership of these robots now, so we\u2019re really giving ourselves some more flexibility in our financial direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis funding not only solidifies that approach from today, but also we are now positioning ourselves from what 2026 and 2027 is going to start to look like,\u201d he added.\n\nToday, Serve has about 100 robots doing deliveries in Los Angeles for around 300 restaurants via Uber Eats and 7-Eleven. In October, the company began a trial in partnership with Wing in Dallas, combining sidewalk robots with drones for deliveries.\n\nServe plans to put an additional 250 robots on the streets of Los Angeles in the first quarter of 2025, and have up to 2,000 bots in multiple U.S. cities by the end of next year through a contract with Uber Eats. Read noted that his company expects to be cash-flow positive from an operational standpoint once that fleet of 2,000 is at full utilization.\n\nThis story has been updated to include additional context and information from Serve Robotics CFO Brian Read.",

    "raw_text": "With CES 2025 finally in the rearview, it\u2019s time to move on to the next round of big hardware announcements. Rumors have emerged over the last few weeks, pointing to an imminent announcement for the next generation of Nintendo\u2019s wildly successful hybrid Switch console.\n\nIn particular, word from industry stalwart Eurogamer (among others) pegs a January 16 announcement \u2014 that is to say, Thursday. If indeed the big reveal is coming this week, it points to a more incremental announcement. The company will likely dole out information one Nintendo Direct at a time rather than one, big keynote with specs, availability, and launch titles.\n\nWe do know for certain that the company had its sights set on a Q1 announcement for the Switch 2 \u2014 specifically, before the end of March 2025. One other key bit confirmed by Nintendo is the device\u2019s backward compatibility with its predecessor. That\u2019s good news for the 150 million or so who purchased the first Switch.\n\nThe biggest question at the moment is how large of an upgrade we\u2019re ultimately talking about here. Nintendo\u2019s console names have largely pointed to big departures for every subsequent generation. With few exceptions \u2014 like the ill-fated Wii U \u2014 things have been far less straightforward than, say, Sony\u2019s PlayStation.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to expect that the Switch 2 will be an evolution of the existing product, rather than a meaningful departure. After all, Nintendo spent some time in the wilderness prior to the Switch\u2019s March 2017 launch. The convertible form factor and some truly excellent titles were precisely what the company needed to reestablish itself in a dramatically different gaming landscape after the Wii U\u2019s stumbles.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt the new console will best the original specs, but it\u2019s also important to temper expectations, given Nintendo\u2019s history. The days of going toe-to-toe with competitors on elements like GPU are decades in the company\u2019s past.\n\nOther rumors are just that: magnetic Joy-Cons and a jump in screen size to eight inches up from six on the classic Switch and seven on the Switch OLED, which arrived toward the end of 2021. Between that console upgrade and the portable-only, budget-minded model that Nintendo introduced with the Switch Lite in 2019, there have been upgrades along the way.\n\n[Nintendo Switch 2 not pictured]",

    "raw_text": "LG Electronics is betting on robotics as its next big growth driver. The South Korean electronics company said on Friday that it has agreed to acquire an additional 30% stake in Bear Robotics, a California-based startup it previously backed that is building AI-powered server robots for restaurants. The deal gives LG a majority ownership of 51% in the startup, which will now become a subsidiary of the larger company. LG declined to comment on the value of its latest stake; a local outlet in Korea says it\u2019s around $180 million. If accurate, that would give Bear an overall valuation of $600 million.\n\nA company spokesperson added that the exact figure would be disclosed once the deal closes.\n\nBear is known for its expertise in AI technology that is capable of controlling multiple robots, specifically the management of fleets remotely, LG said in its statement. The tech giant intends to integrate Bear with its commercial robot unit, which has developed \u201cLG CLOi Robots,\u201d to reinforce its home robot and industrial robot divisions.\n\nThe tech behemoth says it is working on developing a comprehensive software platform for commercial, industrial, and home robots using Bear\u2019s technology. With the robotics industry moving more toward AI-focused solutions, this investment and deal is expected to improve LG\u2019s robotics software capabilities, LG said.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after the electronics company poured $60 million into Bear Robotics in March 2024. That deal already made LG into Bear\u2019s largest shareholder. Bear\u2019s previous funding in 2022 valued it at over $490 million, per PitchBook data.\n\nCEO and founder John Ha and the Bear management team will remain and continue to help create synergies with LG\u2019s robotics unit.\n\nHa, a former Google software engineer turned restaurateur, founded Bear in 2017 after witnessing the challenges of running a restaurant, which motivated him to develop serving robots. The SoftBank-backed startup operates indoor delivery robots in the U.S., South Korea, and Japan. Its robots are designed to help deliver food to restaurant customers.\n\n\u201cThis additional investment underscores our dedication to positioning robots as a pivotal growth engine for the company, reflecting our belief in their inevitable role in the future,\u201d Lee Sam-soo, chief strategy officer at LG Electronics, said in its statement. \u201cWe will persist in driving innovation across all sectors of robotics, encompassing commercial, industrial and home applications.\u201d\n\nRobots and robotics were a big theme this year at CES 2025, and LG made itself a part of that story, with LG CEO William Cho emphasizing the potential for robots to broaden their applications beyond their current roles in sectors like hospitality and delivery logistics.\n\nLG\u2019s interest in the tech goes back well before this year and the recent vogue of AI in everything, with both Korea and Japan being early commercial adopters of some of the earliest iterations in the field. The Korean electronics company has been researching and developing robot software and hardware for more than a decade. In 2017, LG deployed guide robots at South Korea\u2019s largest airport, Incheon International Airport.\n\nLG\u2019s home and industrial robots\n\nLG also has a substantial home robotics business by way of its LG Home Appliance Solution Division. Its home robots are designed to work with home appliances and other domestic scenarios. One example is the self-driving AI home hub, a project named Q9, which is scheduled for release later this year. It has autonomous driving technology and can sense voices, sounds, and images. The Q9 has Microsoft\u2019s voice recognition and synthesis technology, so users can have easy and natural conversations with it.\n\nIts industrial robot, the \u201cAutonomous Vertical Articulated Robot,\u201d uses sensors to navigate, move, and carry out tasks with its robotic arm.\n\nSamsung, LG\u2019s rival in the electronics sector, said earlier this month that it will roll out its home robot in the first half of this year.",

    "raw_text": "Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility \u2014 your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Sign up here for free \u2014 just click TechCrunch Mobility!\n\nIn case you missed it, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would launch a paid ride-hailing service with a fleet of driverless vehicles in Austin in June. For those keeping track, that\u2019s five months away. Musk dropped this announcement during Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call.\n\nMusk provided almost no details about this upcoming service, including what its geo-fence (environmental, geographic, and operational constraints) will be at launch. But perhaps that\u2019s the point: drum up excitement and distract from its rather flat automotive business.\n\nI recommend scrolling through our live blog of the Tesla earnings report and call, as there are lots of nuggets in there that may have been lost in the ether, from bitcoin and lithium refinery progress to Dojo\u2019s absence and how Tesla is training FSD in China. Oh, and finally, Elon admitted that yes, all of those hardware 3 vehicles will need an upgrade to fully unlock future capabilities in its Full Self-Drive software (which is an advanced driver-assistance system).\n\nA little bird\n\nA couple of little birds have shared some behind-the-scenes color over at Cruise, which we included in a recent article about GM and the estimated $1 billion savings the automaker expects from shutting down the robotaxi development program.\n\nTucked inside that article were some tidbits shared by sources at Cruise who told us management began extending retention offers to employees \u2014 almost all of whom were engineers \u2014 in mid-January.\n\n\u201cWhile our plans remain subject to Cruise board approval, I wanted to share that we completed our first wave of notifications to those employees whose roles we expect to need as part of the go-forward Cruise,\u201d CEO Marc Whitten said in the email, which TechCrunch has viewed. He also called for continued patience as senior leadership worked out what the next steps would be and waited for the Cruise board to make a call.\n\nWhitten added that those who haven\u2019t yet received a notification aren\u2019t necessarily at risk of losing their jobs.\n\nSources at Cruise told TechCrunch the board should be meeting in early February, at which time they\u2019ll hopefully come up with a plan for the thousands of now-idle and worried workers.\n\nGot a tip for us?

Or check out these instructions to learn how to contact us via encrypted messaging apps or SecureDrop.\n\nDeals!\n\nIf you\u2019re not already paying attention to Moove, the African mobility fintech company backed by Uber, you should be. The company has had explosive growth in five years. In 2020, Moove had 76 cars in Lagos, Nigeria; today it has 36,000 cars operating in 19 cities across six continents.\n\nYou might recall that Moove announced a partnership with Waymo last year to provide driverless vehicle fleet operations in Phoenix and Miami.\n\nNow the company, which offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers across six continents, is expanding via acquisitions. Moove said it has acquired Kovi, a Brazil-based urban mobility provider.\n\nThe value of the deal is not being disclosed, but Moove confirmed it was an all-share transaction, and Kovi is now wholly owned by Moove. Moove co-founder and co-CEO Ladi Delano told TechCrunch that the deal bumps the mobility fintech\u2019s annual revenue to $275 million.\n\nOther deals that got my attention \u2026\n\nAngell, a French smart electric bike startup, is nearing bankruptcy.\n\nBonsai Robotics, an autonomous agriculture startup based in California, raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Bison Ventures. Cibus Capital, Acre Venture Partners, Congruent Ventures, Fall Line Capital, E14 Fund, SNR, and Serra Ventures also participated.\n\nTravelPerk, a Barcelona-based business travel management platform, has raised $200 million at a hefty $2.7 billion valuation \u2014 almost double the $1.4 billion valuation at its previous fundraise last year. The Series E round was led by European venture capital firm Atomico, with participation from EQT Growth, Noteus Partners, Kinnevik, General Catalyst, among other existing investors. Alongside the raise, TravelPerk also announced it has acquired Swiss startup Yokoy for an undisclosed amount.\n\nUVeye, the Israeli startup that developed a vision-based \u201cMRI for cars,\u201d raised $191 million in an extension to its 2023 Series D round led by Toyota\u2019s Woven Capital growth fund. The round includes a mix of $41 million in equity financing \u2014 with participation from UMC Capital and MyBerg \u2014 and a $150 million debt facility structured by Trinity Capital.\n\nVoi, the Swedish shared micromobility giant, eked out its first profitable year in 2024, according to preliminary unaudited results.\n\nNotable reads and other tidbits\n\nAutonomous vehicles\n\nGM said it expects to save up to $1 billion annually by ending its Cruise robotaxi development program.\n\nKodiak Robotics handed off two autonomous trucks to customer Atlas Energy Solutions \u2014 for driverless operations in an off-road environment in the remote Permian Basin \u2014 marking the startup\u2019s first commercial launch.\n\nWaymo had a busy week. First up, a hidden Waymo feature in its app allowed a security researcher to display whatever characters she wanted on the robotaxi\u2019s top display. The same security researcher also found a new tipping feature while \u201creverse engineering\u201d Waymo\u2019s Android app.\n\nOn the expansion front, Waymo said it will begin testing driverless vehicles on Los Angeles freeways; for now, only employees will be allowed to ride in them. And it also plans to bring its robotaxis \u2014 in manual mode \u2014 to 10 U.S. cities this year. Meanwhile, Waymo has increased its lobbying activity in San Francisco, and one major target appears to be unlocking access to the airport.\n\nElectric vehicles, charging, & batteries\n\nLucid Gravity SUV owners will gain access to Tesla Superchargers on Friday. Here is a roundup of Tesla Supercharger-NACs news, including which automakers now have access to the network.\n\nTesla is bringing its redesigned Model Y SUV to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in March, with a starting price just shy of $60,000.\n\nYou might recall our reporting last month on a handful of lawsuits filed against Rivian by employees who claim they were harassed by executives. Here are some updates on a few of those cases: One, filed by former clay sculptor Nathan Facciolla in October 2024 against Rivian and chief designer Jeff Hammoud, is now being moved to arbitration. A second, filed in February 2024 by former color, material, and finish team director Elizabeth Curran against Rivian and Hammoud, is now tracking toward a potential September 2025 trial date \u2014 though Rivian is trying to get the judge to rule on the case prior to that happening.\n\nIn-car tech\n\nApple admits next-gen CarPlay is late, but says it is still in development.\n\nSpace and future of flight\n\nAmazon is expanding its drone delivery service to the U.K., starting with a north England town of Darlington.\n\nBoom Supersonic went supersonic. The startup\u2019s XB-1 demonstrator plane cleared Mach 1 and stayed supersonic for about four minutes in the skies above California\u2019s Mojave Desert.\n\nThis week\u2019s wheels\n\nNothing this week, but look for a write-up in the next newsletter.\n\nWhat is \u201cThis week\u2019s wheels\u201d? It\u2019s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we\u2019re testing, whether it\u2019s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.",

This includes improvements to the screen reader, along with hearing aid functionality.\n\nThe hearing aid updates arrive after Google expanded the offering as part of its Android 15 rollout. Last year was a big year for the hearing aid industry, as the FDA approved over-the-counter access to the technology in May. This, in turn, has created a new industry of smart hearing aids tied to mobile devices.\n\nIn September, Apple was granted FDA approval for AirPods Pro to double as hearing aids. It\u2019s a move that will no doubt be echoed by several earbud manufacturers in the coming year, facilitated by both first-party software and Android updates.\n\nWednesday\u2019s updates bring LE Bluetooth compatibility, which, in turn, delivers features like hands-free calling and lower latency connections. Along with the S25, the feature is rolling out for the S24 and Google\u2019s own Pixel 9, courtesy of the Android 16 beta updates.\n\nAt the same time, Android\u2019s TalkBack screen reader is getting an update of its own. People who use braille will be able to access HID (human interface design). Introducing the HID standard in 2018, the USB-IF foundation noted that it will \u201cmake it easier to use a braille display across operating systems and different types of hardware. It will also simplify development, removing the need for braille devices to have custom software and drivers created for a particular operating system or screen reader.\u201d\n\nThe feature is arriving on the Galaxy S25 in the coming weeks, followed by all smartphones and tablets running Android 15 in the coming months. TalkBack is also getting improved image descriptions through Google Gemini.",

    "raw_text": "When merchants or companies launch online, they typically start by partnering with one or two payment processors. But as they grow and expand into new regions, they often need to onboard additional payment partners to meet different customer (and sometimes regulatory) needs, a process that comes with some hurdles.\n\nThat\u2019s given rise to companies to help manage the process. Egypt\u2019s MoneyHash \u2014 which helps merchants across the Middle East and Africa manage complex payment stacks more easily \u2014 has raised $5.2 million as it scales to target larger enterprises. The pre-Series A comes around a year after its last funding, when it announced a $4.5 million seed round in February 2024. In total, MoneyHash has raised over $12 million since Nader Abdelrazik and Mustafa Eid launched the Egyptian fintech in early 2021.\n\nThe area that MoneyHash works in is classically described as \u201cpayment orchestration,\u201d and in the fragmented world of payments \u2014 where a business might work with dozens of different providers to take, make, and bank payments \u2014 its star has risen with the growth of online transactions. Integrating multiple payment stacks can be operationally inefficient and technically complex, often taking in-house tech teams weeks to complete. These challenges are even more apparent across Africa and the Middle East due to the various payment methods and currencies. This is where payment orchestration platforms come in by aggregating and simplifying these payment processes across regions via APIs.\n\nAbdelrazik and Eid founded MoneyHash after years of working in fintech and enterprise software and witnessing firsthand some of the problems. Put simply, payments are (perhaps obviously) the crux of how a business operates, grows, and makes a profit. But too often there were instead costly and risky bottlenecks, especially for smaller merchants: Payment failure rates in the region are three times the global average and cart abandonment is more than 20% higher than in developed markets. They saw orchestration as the solution: By their thinking, merchants without payment orchestration platforms are at the mercy of high operational costs and revenue leakage, and will find it hard to scale across regions.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to solve this is immense,\u201d said CEO Abdelrazik. \u201cIn emerging markets, digital payments represent only a fraction of total transaction volume, suggesting massive growth potential in the coming decade. We\u2019ve built MoneyHash specifically to help merchants overcome these complex challenges and turn payments from a liability into a strategic advantage.\u201d\n\nMoneyHash integrates with a merchant\u2019s payment providers to give its customers a simplified way of working across that stack. It offers features like a unified API for pay-in and pay-out operations, customizable checkout, advanced transaction routing with fraud prevention, failure rate optimization, and detailed reporting tools. The company also supports recurring payments, virtual wallets, subscription management, and payment links, delivering an \u201call-in-one solution\u201d for merchants, it said.\n\nJust as you have a16z-backed Payrails, Spreedly, Zooz, and Primer in the U.S., U.K., and Europe, MoneyHash serves customers across the Middle East and Africa. Abdelrazik said that\u2019s what sets MoneyHash apart: its focus on emerging markets and its vast integration network, which includes over 300 pre-integrated APIs (with local and international processors and gateways like Adyen, Amazon Pay, Checkout, Fawry, Mono, Stripe, Tabby, and ValU) covering 100+ markets. QED-backed Precium (formerly Revio), a South African upstart, provides similar services in the region.\n\nMoneyHash initially focused on small merchants but began targeting larger enterprises in early 2024 with the launch of its enterprise suite, a move that has allowed the company to achieve notable scale.\n\n\u201cWithout us, you can still do a lot of performance enhancements that will take years of work and studying. But when you add our software, all performance metrics across the payment get to the highest level possible. We\u2019re talking about the authorization, conversion, and fraud rates. And we\u2019re pretty comprehensive,\u201d remarked CEO Abdelrazik.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not focusing on only one performance metric to try to fix all the problems across the entire payment chain life cycle, which is what enterprises need. Enterprise doesn\u2019t want to solve one problem. They\u2019ll search for other problems. They want a comprehensive solution across the payment cycle, and that\u2019s what we do.\u201d\n\nEnterprises across industries like consumer fintech, hospitality, e-commerce, and gaming now make up 35% of MoneyHash\u2019s clientele, a threefold increase in 2024. Key customers include BNPL unicorn Tamara, cloud kitchen leader Kitopi, and e-commerce platform Brands For Less.\n\nAccording to the head of payments at Tamara, MoneyHash stands out in the region by \u201cbuilding an important point of difference,\u201d likely referring to its claims to help clients achieve a 10-20% increase in revenue generation while cutting go-to-market and development costs by 90%.\n\nMeanwhile, Abdelrazik credits his startup\u2019s enterprise pipeline and long-term contracts helped in raising the pre-Series A funding. He said these customers fueled a 4x increase in processing volume and a 3x revenue increase over the past year, though specific figures remain undisclosed.\n\nGlobal fintech investor Flourish Ventures led the round. Other investors include Saudi\u2019s Vision Ventures, Arab Bank\u2019s Xelerate, and Emurgo Kepple Ventures. The round also welcomed participation from Jason Gardner, founder and former CEO of Marqeta (his first check in the region), and existing investors GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner and COTU Ventures.",

Recently, the tech company has struggled to rein in its carbon emissions as AI has driven a surge in data center construction and use.\n\nMicrosoft reported last year that its emissions rose 29% since 2020 as a result of the boom in AI and cloud computing, imperiling its 2030 goal to sequester more carbon than it produces. In 2023, the company reported generating 17.1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions before offsets.\n\nCarbon credits come in a range of flavors. Chestnut Carbon focuses on reforestation, in which the company facilitates tree planting and then monitors the new forests to ensure they grow as planned and aren\u2019t cut down.

Credits from projects that plant non-native, fast-growing trees are generally seen as lower quality and sell for less since they don\u2019t tend to support as much biodiversity, and the trees don\u2019t tend to live as long. Projects that support diverse, native plantings typically sell at a premium since the ecosystems that result tend to be more resilient over time.\n\nEven premium carbon credits from afforestation, reforestation, and avoided deforestation are a relative deal compared with some alternatives. Chestnut Carbon sold credits last year for $34 per ton, whereas direct air capture, which uses fans and chemical sorbents to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere, costs around $600 to $1,000 per ton today. Despite the cost differential, Microsoft has also bought carbon credits from direct air capture startups.",

This is the firm\u2019s largest fundraise to date, exceeding $690 million across two funds Madrona closed in 2022.\n\nWhile an 11% capital pool upsize may not seem significant, any increase at a time when many venture outfits are forced to reduce their fund hauls is a sign that limited partners are excited about the firm\u2019s prospects and recent track record.\n\nMadrona\u2019s managing director, Matt McIlwain, told TechCrunch that it helped that last year \u2014 in a market where exits were few and far between \u2014 the firm sold a few portfolio companies and distributed capital to its investors. The firm\u2019s recent exits include Lexion, which sold to Docusign for $165 million, and Octo AI, which Nvidia acquired for a reported $250 million.\n\n\u201cThe LP community is generally concerned about distributions,\u201d McIlwain said. \u201cI think we stood out as a firm that had done really well on that front, not just this past year, but over many years.\u201d\n\nMadrona started as a group of \u201csuper angels\u201d who wrote a check to an online bookseller, Amazon, in 1995. The firm has since evolved into a multi-stage investor that has backed companies like Redfin, Smartsheet, Snowflake, and, more recently, AI startups Typeface and Runway.\n\nAlthough Madrona undoubtedly benefited from being the largest VC firm in the same geographic location as Amazon and Microsoft, it decided to venture beyond Seattle by opening an office in Silicon Valley in 2022.\n\nMcIlwain said that the fresh capital will be used to invest in AI applications in domains ranging from travel to life sciences, as well as in infrastructure companies that \u201ccan remove friction\u201d between foundational models and users. The firm will back about 30 pre-seed, seed, and Series A startups from its approximately $490 million early-stage fund, and the remaining capital will go toward 12 companies raising their Series B or Series C.\n\nAs Madrona enters its fourth decade, it is extremely optimistic about what\u2019s ahead in 2025. McIlwain described the current conditions as a \u201crisk-on mindset\u201d that will help foster entrepreneurship and create value.",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), they\u2019re the leading cause of injury for adults aged 65 and up. On average, about 10% of these falls are serious, requiring medical attention. Yet many fall victims don\u2019t get the treatment they need.\n\nGeorge Netscher, a software developer by training, watched his grandmother and aunt, both of whom had Alzheimer\u2019s, struggle to avoid falls. Worried that his mother might also develop the disease, Netscher founded a tech company, SafelyYou, in search of a better care solution.\n\n\u201cThe tech originated in 2015 as part of my doctoral research,\u201d Netscher told TechCrunch. \u201cSafelyYou\u2019s mission is to ensure the highest-quality care for seniors in any care setting.\u201d\n\nSafelyYou, which sells its platform to senior living communities, employs a combination of cameras and AI-powered sensors to detect when a person might be falling. Once those sensors spot a fall, they trigger text message and phone alerts to on-call staff so they can attend to the fallen person.\n\nSafelyYou also retains a remote clinical team to document each fall. The team makes recommendations to SafelyYou\u2019s customers so that they can take steps to reduce risk.\n\n\u201cOur expert clinicians have analyzed more than 300,000 on-the-ground events,\u201d Netscher said, \u201cand regularly review fall videos, conduct root cause analyses, and provide suggestions that help to reduce future falls in senior living communities.\u201d\n\nThere are other fall-detection products on the market aimed at older populations. But Netscher claims that SafelyYou is less susceptible to false alarms.\n\n\u201cSome other fall technologies won\u2019t detect a fall unless someone has been on the ground for at least 12 seconds, which could miss an individual\u2019s fall entirely if they fell and recovered,\u201d Netscher said. \u201cOur technology is completely ambient and does not require wearables or other inputs from residents or caregivers.\u201d\n\nSafelyYou nearly shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic, when assisted-living facilities around the country were effectively quarantined. The startup managed to make it through, however, and is now serving nearly 1,000 senior living communities.\n\nTo support SafelyYou\u2019s expansion, the company recently closed a $43 million Series C round led by Touring Capital with participation from Foundation Capital, Omega Healthcare Investors, Founders Fund, Cross Creek Advisors, Samsung Next, and Qualcomm Ventures.\n\nNetscher says that the new capital, which brings SafelyYou\u2019s total raised to over $100 million, will be put toward growing the company\u2019s roughly 100-person, San Francisco-based team.",

And, you know, that\u2019s what you see in that model,\u201d said Cook, responding to an analyst\u2019s question about how DeepSeek\u2019s AI models would impact Apple\u2019s margins.\n\nCook went on to note that Apple leverages a hybrid model for its AI, in which it runs some simple tasks locally \u2014 using its own AI models on its device\u2019s custom silicon chips. Meanwhile, other, more complicated tasks run in the cloud through partnerships with AI model providers.\n\nCook also said Apple has always taken a \u201cprudent and deliberate\u201d approach to these types of expenditures.\n\nApple currently only has one AI partnership, with OpenAI, which allows ChatGPT to answer complex questions from iPhone users in a private cloud.\n\nOpenAI claimed this week to have evidence that its AI models were used to train DeepSeek\u2019s AI models through a process called distillation. If true, that would violate OpenAI\u2019s usage policies and undermine DeepSeek\u2019s accomplishments.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Apple\u2019s CEO from tossing a compliment toward DeepSeek.\n\nApple has indicated its OpenAI partnership is not exclusive, and it may integrate other companies\u2019 AI models into the iPhone in the future, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Cook did not go as far as to suggest Apple would integrate DeepSeek\u2019s models, however.\n\nBeyond OpenAI\u2019s allegations of IP theft, several tech analysts have suggested that DeepSeek\u2019s AI models were trained with significantly more GPUs and computation costs than the company claims. That would mean DeepSeek\u2019s AI models were not trained quite as efficiently as some suspected. Still, the Chinese AI lab sells access to its models at a steep discount compared with what American AI labs charge.\n\nInvestors also peppered Cook with questions about the success of Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe phased launch of Apple\u2019s AI features does not appear to have created the immediate boost to iPhone sales that some predicted. Instead, sales slightly declined in the last quarter, compared to last year.\n\nHoping to spin the decline more favorably, Cook claimed the company saw stronger sales in regions where Apple Intelligence had rolled out than regions where it had not.",

    "raw_text": "Ati Motors on Wednesday announced a $20 million raise. The funding arrives as the Indian-based autonomous mobile robots (AMR) startup looks toward global expansion. The firm hopes to tap into increased demand for domestic manufacturing in the U.S., India, and Southeast Asian nations, as countries look to lessen their dependence on China.\n\nIn 2023, the Indian IT ministry proposed a nationwide policy titled National Strategy for Robotics to position the South Asian nation as a global robotics leader by 2030. The country ranks as the seventh largest robotics market, with a 59% YoY growth in annual industrial robotics installations, with 8,500 units in 2023, per the International Federation of Robotics. However, it still lags significantly behind China, Japan, and the U.S.\n\n\u201cOur competitor is always the status quo, not really another robot,\u201d Saurabh Chandra, founder and CEO of Ati Motors, said in an interview. \u201cTypically, we are displacing manual operation or somebody driving a vehicle or often somebody pushing it by hands.\u201d\n\nThe 7-year-old startup, which has a manufacturing and R&D facility in Bengaluru, has developed seven distinct robots, two of which are currently in testing and will be available starting this quarter. The robots can move trolleys, bins, and pallets in a factory or warehouse.\n\nAti Motors\u2019 robots come with 3D lidar sensors and have spatial awareness. This enables these robots to work even in a tough environment where harsh weather, including rain, can impact manufacturing. The robots can also move on various flooring conditions and even handle gradients, cracks, or oil spills in their path, Chandra told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cWe do the full stack ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been our USP that we are able to do complete multi-disciplinary engineering.\u201d\n\nAti Motors has designed the software and hardware for its robots in-house, including their sensor-fusion algorithms. Like many others in the space, the company relies on Nvidia\u2019s Jetson platform for edge computing. It also offers dedicated fleet management software that can work with other companies\u2019 mobile robots to provide customers interoperability.\n\n\u201cThe future is such that millions of robots are going to go into factories. No one company is going to make all the millions of robots alone. And should we want to play with other people from day one? Yes,\u201d Chandra said.\n\nFounded in February 2017, Ati Motors started its journey with a tugging robot. However, based on customer feedback and demand, it expanded into pallet movers and lifters.\n\nThe startup offers a robots-as-a-service (RaaS) model to let companies lease its AMRs. Customers can also buy the systems outright.\n\nAti Motors says it has deployed \u201chundreds\u201d of its Sherpa robots across 40 manufacturers as its customers, including Airbus, Ceat Tyres, Forvia, Hyundai, Samsung, and TVS Motor. Of its total customer base, 80% are in the automobile sector and the U.S. dominates its revenues. Therefore, the startup plans to expand its North American presence in Detroit.\n\nThe all-equity Series B funding was co-led by Walden Catalyst Ventures and NGP Capital. It also featured existing investors, including True Ventures, Exfinity Venture Partners, Athera Venture Partners, and Blume Ventures.",

    "raw_text": "Kodiak Robotics has officially handed off two autonomous trucks to customer Atlas Energy Solutions, marking the startup\u2019s first commercial launch.\n\nAtlas, a provider of proppant (i.e., sand) and oilfield logistics, received its first Kodiak-equipped trucks in December and began driverless operations in an off-road environment in West Texas\u2019s remote Permian Basin shortly after. The company has already delivered 100 loads using self-driving trucks without a human safety driver behind the wheel, according to Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time, as far as we\u2019re aware, that the customer is owning and operating the driverless vehicle, instead of the AV company, and we think this is the model of the future,\u201d Burnette told TechCrunch.\n\nUntil now, Kodiak \u2014 and its competitors in the space like Aurora Innovation and Waabi \u2014 has performed commercial pilots for customers on highways with human safety drivers behind the wheel. During these pilots, Kodiak-owned trucks ran freight on behalf of shippers or carriers. The goal, though, is to sell the AI Driver-as-a-Solution to companies like Atlas. In other words, Kodiak and others don\u2019t want to run their own shipping operations in the long run, but rather focus on selling the self-driving technology.\n\nFor comparison, in the robotaxi industry, companies like Waymo and formerly Cruise have owned and operated their own ride-hail services, but Waymo\u2019s recent partnerships with Uber and Moovit signal that the company may eventually bow out of operating such services, too.\n\nKodiak first announced its partnership with Atlas in July 2024 after the two completed Kodiak\u2019s first driverless run delivering frac sand in West Texas\u2019s remote Permian Basin \u2014 an unstructured, off-road environment. While Kodiak still has active pilots running freight on highways and plans to pursue long-haul autonomous trucking, the Atlas deal is a key part of the startup\u2019s near-term go-to-market strategy.\n\nOff-road autonomy has its own set of unique challenges \u2014 like a constantly changing landscape and no HD maps to rely on \u2014 but it presents a faster path to revenue than highway driving, according to Burnette.\n\nAnd that bet is already bearing fruit.\n\nKodiak is now generating revenue from Atlas through a combined hardware and software annual subscription that includes the cost of Kodiak\u2019s modular sensors, which are fitted onto the Atlas-owned trucks, as well as the self-driving software, monitoring, and update services.\n\n\u201cWe integrate APIs into [the customer\u2019s transportation management system] that allows Atlas to use their existing tools to effectively tell the driverless trucks where to go,\u201d Burnette said. \u201cBut more importantly, they control the logistics. We\u2019re not involved in that. We just make sure that while the trucks are operating, that they\u2019re up, they\u2019re healthy, they\u2019re safe, and if there are any issues, we can step in and perform maintenance.\u201d\n\nAtlas, which operates across the 75,000-square-mile Permian Basis in Texas and New Mexico, plans to scale its driverless trucking deployments over the course of the year, so Kodiak has established an office in nearby Odessa, Texas to support Atlas\u2019 operations \u2014 an 18,000-square-foot facility with a team of 12 Kodiak employees. Kodiak intends to grow that number to about 20 people by the end of the first quarter.",

    "raw_text": "Samsung on Wednesday announced the latest additions to its Galaxy S flagship smartphone line at the company\u2019s annual Samsung Unpacked 2025. As suspected, the defining characteristic of the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra is the company\u2019s continued focus on mobile AI \u2014 a fact that hardly distinguishes the consumer electronics giant from the rest of the industry.\n\nHeadlining the trio is the Galaxy S25 Ultra. At $1,300, the stylus-sporting Galaxy Note successor maintains the same price point as last year\u2019s model. The handset sports a 6.9-inch display and quartet of rear-facing cameras: a 50-megapixel ultra-wide, 200-megapixel wide, and a pair of telephoto lenses, with 3x and 5x optical zoom, respectively.\n\nThe Ultra is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, Qualcomm\u2019s latest flagship \u2014 the same chip found in all three S25 tiers. Once again, Samsung has added its own tweaks and accompanying branding to the silicon, as the vanilla version will be powering a majority of flagship smartphones released over the next 12 months.\n\nThe company promises a 37% performance boost for CPU processing and a 30% increase on the GPU side. Naturally, the NPU (neural processing unit) gets the biggest boost at 40%, owing to both the relative infancy of the processors and the industry-wide focus on all things both artificial and intelligent.\n\nThe S25 Ultra and S25+ have access to ProScaler. The AI image \u201csharpening\u201d feature apparently requires their QHD+ display resolution to function properly. Gaming graphics enhancements, meanwhile, arrive by way of the Snapdragon\u2019s on-device Vulkan Engine and Ray Tracing features. Device cooling is accomplished by way of a 40% larger vapor chamber.\n\nGoogle\u2019s AI offerings, meanwhile, have become even more central to the device\u2019s functionality. Gone are the days of quick Home and Bixby access. In their place, Gemini can now be activated with a long press of the device\u2019s side button. Along with Circle to Search, which debuted on the Galaxy line, the devices also have a variety of generative AI-powered writing and drawing features.\n\nThe Ultra sports a 5,000mAh battery, coupled with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage, and it comes in Titanium Silverblue, Titanium Whitesilver, Titanium Gray, Titanium Black, and pink, gold, and green options only available to those who purchase directly through Samsung.\n\nAll three S25 models are up for preorder Wednesday, with shipping starting February 7.",

But private companies, too, made headlines.\n\nMost interesting startup stories from the week\n\nIn startup land, even a small profit is newsworthy and could lead to tomorrow\u2019s IPOs. In the meantime, we look at an M&A and some mission-driven startups fighting fire.\n\nScooting along: Swedish shared micromobility startup Voi reported its first profitable year. While modestly cash-positive, these 2024 results put the scooter and e-bike company in a better position to explore an IPO in upcoming years.\n\nMerging humanoids: OpenAI-backed Norwegian robotics startup 1X acquired Kind Humanoid, whose three-person team had started working with high-profile designer Yves B\u00e9har in 2024.\n\nOn track: French health insurance startup Alan revealed that it generated approximately $525 million in revenue in 2024 and confirmed its goal to reach profitability by 2026.\n\nFirefighters: In the aftermath of Southern California\u2019s recent devastating fires, TechCrunch\u2019s Tim De Chant rounded up startups that help measure and mitigate wildfire risk.\n\nMost interesting VC and funding news this week\n\nSome significant rounds were announced this week, but perhaps even more interestingly, we saw some sizable valuation increases.\n\nHot like fusion: Nuclear startup Helion raised a $425 million Series F round of funding to help build a fusion reactor for Microsoft. This new round is smaller than the previous one, but valuation increased to $5.245 billion.\n\nPerking up: Barcelona-based corporate travel management platform TravelPerk closed a $200 million Series E round of funding at a $2.7 billion valuation \u2014 almost twice its previous $1.4 billion valuation.\n\nQuantum race: With $104 million in Series B funding, French startup Alice & Bob secured one of the larger rounds for a quantum computing startup in Europe.\n\nAI against cancer: Quibim, a Spanish startup that\u2019s developing AI models for medical imaging, raised a $50 million Series A round of funding to double down on its U.S. expansion plans. Its flagship product, QP-Prostate, focuses on prostate cancer detection.\n\nChallenging Autodesk: Motif, a startup developing architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) software, secured $46 million in seed and Series A funding to challenge its founders\u2019 former employer, Autodesk, with a next-generation design platform for buildings.\n\nBigger target: Regulatory filing revealed that 8VC, the Austin-based VC firm led by Palantir founder Joe Lonsdale, is hoping to raise around $1 billion for its sixth fund. Its previous flagship vehicle closed at $880 million in 2023.\n\nTaking it to 11: ElevenLabs, which works in the AI audio field, announced that it raised $180 million in a Series C round, valuing the company at $3.3 billion post-money. Andreessen Horowitz and ICONIQ Growth are co-leading investment.\n\nLast but not least",

The round includes a mix of $41 million in equity financing \u2014 with participation from UMC Capital and MyBerg \u2014 and a $150 million debt facility structured by Trinity Capital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re installing at quite a lot of locations, and we\u2019re getting a lot of data, and we\u2019ve signed some very strategic deals in the past year, and we have, right now, more demand than we can actually support,\u201d UVeye CEO and co-founder Amir Hever told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cSo there\u2019s a need to be able to fund more systems, deploy more units, and scale really, really quickly.\u201d\n\nThe debt includes a $100 million initial commitment and an option for an additional $50 million, and will help UVeye deploy close to 700 of its inspection systems in 2025, Hever said.\n\nThe systems \u2014 which cars can drive through and use cameras to scan the undercarriage, exterior, and interior \u2014 have been popular with customers that include Amazon, CarMax (which invested in the 2023 Series D), and even car dealers and manufacturers.\n\nHever said working with those customers has influenced the evolution of UVeye\u2019s tech and business model. The company was initially focused on a car\u2019s undercarriage, since it was trying to modernize roadside security screenings. But customers started asking for the ability to inspect things like tire wear, or scan the car\u2019s exterior for damage.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a step-by-step [process] to really understand the market needs, and how they are inspecting vehicles today, and how we can help them to be more efficient, to increase their revenue, to support our business,\u201d Hever said.\n\nNow, Hever said, UVeye is scanning nearly one million cars per month.",

    "raw_text": "Microsoft is rolling out a new tool dubbed \u201cscareware blocker,\u201d which uses machine learning and computer vision to identify a very pervasive type of online scam.\n\n\u201cScareware\u201d has blighted the web almost since its inception, often in the form of fake antivirus software that claims to have detected a nonexistent threat on a user\u2019s machine. They then either trick the user into installing a malicious program or paying for software they don\u2019t need.\n\nJust last year, two tech support firms were forced to pay $26 million as part of a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which had accused the companies of deceptive marketing practices, including using fake Windows pop-ups, to scam consumers.\n\n\u201cThese companies used scare tactics and lies about threats to consumers\u2019 personal computers to bilk consumers, particularly older consumers, out of tens of millions of dollars,\u201d Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement at the time.\n\nMicrosoft already offers some tools to block scammy websites that have been detected and reported elsewhere, but the new feature is all about blocking previously unknown scam tools when they attempt to open a full-screen page.\n\nMicrosoft first teased the blocker at its Ignite conference in November, but now it\u2019s calling on users to help test the feature through a preview program in its Edge browser.\n\nSetting up\n\nScareware blocker requires the user to activate the feature through the \u201cPrivacy, search, and services\u201d setting in Edge.\n\nThis adds an additional level of security to what exists within the likes of Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, which already looks for suspicious activity on web pages. Scareware blocker specifically intervenes if a scam tool attempts to open a full-screen page, a tactic that can make it more difficult both to identify a scam and circumvent it \u2014 for example, a user might not know to hit the \u201cEsc\u201d key to exit full-screen mode.\n\nMicrosoft said it used thousands of real-world sample scams to train the machine learning model that underpins scareware blocker. It then uses computer vision to compare these samples with new scams it encounters in real time.\n\nIf the tool suspects potential scareware, it will exit full-screen mode, stop any audio playback (e.g., an alarm or voice) that might accompany the scam, and give the user the option to continue to the page or close it completely.\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe fact that Microsoft is using computer vision to analyze users\u2019 screens might raise concerns. There are some parallels with Microsoft\u2019s controversial AI-powered Recall feature, which takes snapshots of users\u2019 screens to create a searchable history of everything they\u2019ve done on the computer.\n\nHowever, with scareware blocker, Microsoft maintains that the machine learning model runs locally on the user\u2019s machine, and nothing is saved or sent to the cloud.\n\nTo improve the model and broader Defender SmartScreen software, Microsoft is also soliciting feedback from early adopters, presenting them an option to share a screenshot of the scam with Microsoft. Users can also report scenarios where scareware blocker makes a mistake and blocks a genuine website.",

During an earnings call, Musk said there will be no drivers in the cars, which will use the yet-to-be-released \u201cunsupervised\u201d version of its Full Self-Driving software. He also said he expects the unsupervised FSD software to be released to owners in California and \u201cmany regions of the U.S.\u201d this year. But the idea of owners adding their own cars to the Tesla ride-hail fleet won\u2019t happen until at least next year, Musk said.\n\nThe CEO then called 2025 \u201cmaybe the most important year in Tesla\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nMusk first teased the idea of starting up a paid self-driving service back in October when Tesla revealed its purpose-built Cybercab prototype, which has no steering wheel or pedals. He said at the time that Tesla was looking to launch an early version of the ride-hailing service in Texas and California in 2025 using Model Y SUVs and Model 3 sedans.\n\nBloomberg News recently reported that Tesla was in talks with Austin city officials to make that happen. The city\u2019s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk said Wednesday that Tesla is \u201cputting our toe in the water gently at first, just to make sure everything\u2019s cool,\u201d but didn\u2019t offer any further detail about what that means. Tesla has been testing the performance of unsupervised FSD software on its factory grounds in Texas, he said \u2014 a location that has far less complexity than a real-world environment.\n\n\u201cThen, you know, put a few more toes in the water, then put a foot in the water, with safety of the general public and those in the car as a top priority,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk said Tesla is \u201clooking for a safety level that is significantly above the average human driver,\u201d but did not specify how Tesla is making that measurement.\n\nThe company has long published a so-called \u201cvehicle safety report\u201d on its website that shares the number of miles traveled between crashes on Autopilot, its less capable driver assistance software. The company compares that number to an overall government crash figure for human drivers. But there are a number of problems with this comparison. Much of Autopilot driving happens on highways and not on surface streets. Tesla also does not offer any detail about the conditions or severity of these crashes.\n\nThis story has been updated with more details from the earnings call.",

    "raw_text": "As enterprises look at how they can best leverage AI to increase their employees\u2019 productivity, search is an obvious use case. In most companies, after all, data lives in multiple disconnected silos and the combination of large language models, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and enterprise-grade integration services now makes it easier than ever to not just enable search but also create tools that can answer more complex questions about all of this data. It\u2019s no surprise then that there are quite a few startups and incumbents (think Atlassian\u2019s Rovo, for example) vying for this market. One of the newest entrants is Doti AI, a Tel Aviv-based startup that announced a $7 million seed funding round today.\n\nDoti AI integrates data from services like Confluence, Datadog, GitLab, Jira, Monday, Notion, Slack, Salesforce, Zendesk, and others, and then makes this data available on demand, through a chat experience in Slack, for example, as well as through what Doti calls its \u201cAutoPilot.\u201d The AutoPilot proactively monitors Slack channels and when it comes across a question it can answer, it will respond directly in that channel.\n\nThis, Doti co-founders Matan Cohen (CEO) and Opher Hofshi (CPO) told me, is also how Doti quickly reaches critical mass within a company, as employees go from seeing Doti in their various Slack channels and then start 1:1 chats with the service as well.\n\nThe two co-founders first met at Wix, when Cohen worked on the service\u2019s infrastructure and Hofshi led a team of security architects. \u201cWhen we left Wix [in 2023], we didn\u2019t really know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Hofshi told me. \u201cOur initial thought was going into one of our areas \u2014 doing what we\u2019ve been doing for the last couple of years. For me, it was cybersecurity, and for Matan, it was about the infrastructure.\u201d\n\nDuring the ideation process, they realized that enterprise search remains an unsolved problem. \u201cThe problem Doti solves is something that we felt at Wix,\u201d Cohen said. And solving it, the founders argue, takes expertise in building the integrations, but also a strong focus on security.\n\n\u201cWhat we believe is that every person, every group, every process, every company will need to have some sort of AI in their veins \u2014 or their processes \u2014 and it\u2019s not a matter of if, it\u2019s a matter of when, and how fast companies will adapt,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nThe team argues that even though other companies may offer similar features at first glance, its approach offers quite a bit more flexibility. That\u2019s because Doti was built from the ground up to, for example, allow businesses to bring their own large language models to the service, all while also helping them set their own security policies. \u201cWe know how to bring a very good solution for enterprises and we\u2019re as flexible as they want,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cYou want to bring your own LLM? go for it. You want to bring your own cloud? We can do this. You want to do AWS, you want to do Azure, you want to do GCP? Go for it, and this is on the infra level, and this is a deal breaker for organizations.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s $7 million seed round was led by F2 Venture Capital, with participation from a number of angel investors, including Jared Kasner, a general partner at Ineffable Ventures, and Guy Flechter, the CEO of Sola Security.",

Mahaniok immigrated to the U.S. from Belarus and spoke to TechCrunch a few years ago about how hard the venture ecosystem can be for immigrants.\n\n\u201cTalent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not,\u201d he told us at the time.\n\nSo he launched Geek Ventures and raised a $23 million debut fund. It joined a few other notable venture firms that have launched to target immigrants, including Unshackled Ventures and One Way Ventures.\n\nGeek Ventures focuses on SaaS, hardware, and deep tech. It has cut checks into companies like the AI developer Spice AI and the networking platform Saturday, according to PitchBook, which also states the firm has made more than 60 investments to date.\n\nFund II has no target amount but has so far raised $9 million, according to the filing, with its first sale registered as being Monday, January 13.\n\nIhar Mahaniok declined to comment.",

For years, Amazon\u2019s chokehold and sway in the publishing industry have been so strong that authors and booksellers have accused the company of operating a monopoly.\n\nAmazon is dominant in the sale of e-books because of its Kindle, which is one of the leading e-readers on the market. Conscious consumers can turn to companies like Kobo for their hardware, but even so, there often aren\u2019t options to buy e-books directly from publishers and independent booksellers, which means that readers usually resort to Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or other big box retailers.\n\nBookshop.org and Libro.fm have emerged as alternatives to Amazon, sharing a cut of sales with independent bookstores around America. But for e-book readers, it\u2019s been challenging to buy new titles without going through Amazon\u2019s ecosystem.

    "raw_text": "Apple\u2019s latest earnings were a mixed bag, with slipping iPhone sales countered by rising revenue.\n\nReporting after the bell Thursday, the iPhone maker\u2019s overall revenue in the first quarter of 2025 beat Wall Street expectations, with a 4% bump to $124.3 billion over the same time last year.\n\nApple reported net income of $36.33 billion, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same year-ago period.\n\nThe increase came even as the company missed iPhone estimates, with an 11.1% sales drop in China knocking revenue down to $18.51 billion. It\u2019s the largest drop in this key region since a nearly 13% dip in Q1 2024.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest smartphone market has proven increasingly difficult for the company, owing to more intense competition from domestic manufacturers, including Oppo and Vivo. Huawei, which saw a massive drop in sales as trade restrictions were imposed by the first Trump administration, has since surged in its home country.\n\nIn a conversation with CNBC, CEO Tim Cook placed some of the blame at the feet of Apple Intelligence \u2014 which isn\u2019t currently available in China \u2014 along with several other key markets. Apple\u2019s small model generative AI platform is, by far, the biggest selling point for the iPhone 16, which debuted late last year.\n\n\u201cDuring the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,\u201d Cook said.\n\nThe AI platform is currently available in English (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, U.K., and U.S.). Chinese is among the languages coming later this year, but Apple has yet to announce whether the feature will ultimately arrive in mainland China.\n\nRegulatory approval and security restrictions are among the issues standing between Apple Intelligence and a China rollout. The company reportedly teamed up with domestic internet giant Baidu to add AI features to iPhones in the country. But that deal has apparently hit its own roadblocks.\n\nCook also pointed to channel inventory, which has restricted the availability of new hardware in the country.\n\niPhone sales declined slightly year-over-year, in spite of the company\u2019s anticipation of an Apple Intelligence-driven boost. The platform experienced a slow rollout in iOS 18, with features arriving in waves. Some features like news summaries had a rocky launch as well. Apple paused the feature to address an issue with surfacing incorrect information.\n\nBoth Mac and iPad revenue grew by 15% for the quarter, thanks to the launch of a new iPad Mini, iMac, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro. Services \u2014 which includes things like Apple TV+, Apple Music, and iCloud \u2014 saw 14% growth for the quarter.\n\nAll told, the company now has an install base of 2.35 billion active devices, up from 2.2 billion the same time last year. Cook also noted that Apple now boasts 1 billion subscriptions across its content offerings and third-party apps.",

During this meeting, European Commission officials will quiz these tech companies about how they would react to different scenarios that could interfere with the upcoming election, from AI-generated fakes to disinformation campaigns, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTechCrunch has reached out to all the companies included for comment and will update this piece if we hear back.\n\nThis stress test will see whether tech companies are compliant with the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, which requires companies to have safeguards and protocol in place to combat misinformation and illegal content on their platforms.\n\nThis test is ahead of Germany\u2019s snap federal election in February; the results could have large implications on the broader EU, as Germany is the largest member of the bloc.\n\nThe EU is likely taking a closer look at how tech companies are complying with the DSA now after bloc member Romania annulled the results of the first round of its presidential election last year after evidence of Russian interference, which they think may have been boosted by TikTok\u2019s algorithm, and the documentation of 85,000 attempted cyberattacks on election websites and IT.\n\nElon Musk, and X, have already played a role in this upcoming election in Germany. Musk recently interviewed Alice Weidel, the leader of Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party and a candidate in Germany\u2019s upcoming election, on X.\n\nThis news comes just one day after President Donald Trump took aim at how EU regulators treat U.S. tech companies, including Google, Meta, and Apple, two of which have been invited to this stress test.\n\nWhile speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said that the regulation of U.S.-based tech companies by EU regulators was \u201ca form of taxation.\u201d",

Services generated nearly $100 billion in revenue over the past year, CEO Tim Cook said during Thursday\u2019s earnings call. In addition, Apple reported having more than 1 billion subscriptions across its services, including through third-party apps in the App Store.\n\nThe company said that customer engagement with its services, including both transacting and paid accounts, reached record highs. Paid accounts and subscriptions both grew by double digits year over year.\n\nApple pointed to expansions of specific offerings like Apple Arcade, which continues to add games and Fitness+, which adds new programs. It also noted Apple\u2019s Tap to Pay for iPhone, which is now live in 20 markets.\n\nRegulatory impact\n\nOn the topic of subscriptions, investors wanted to know how a new regulatory environment could potentially affect these numbers.\n\nWhile investors didn\u2019t outright ask about the Trump administration\u2019s impact on Apple revenue directly, one question focused on whether new regulatory changes could be beneficial. That is, would a \u201cmore balanced regulatory environment\u201d potentially reverse prior headwinds that Apple may now be absorbing in its results?\n\nApple\u2019s CFO, Kevan Parekh, skirted the question, reiterating instead the positive numbers for Services and adding that customer engagement was increasing across the customer base, all its services offerings, and geographic regions. CEO Tim Cook didn\u2019t respond to the question.\n\nFor years, Apple has defended itself over antitrust lawsuits and other governmental actions, both in the U.S. and abroad. The core debate has centered on how much of a percentage Apple is justified to take from the apps it hosts on its App Store and the transactions that flow through them.\n\nLast year, one key antitrust case finally came to an end when the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately declined to hear an appeal on the Epic-Apple decision, initially filed by the Fortnite game maker. That means the lower court\u2019s decision that the tech giant was not a monopolist still stands.\n\nHowever, that decision did mean Apple has to allow app makers to steer customers to the web from links inside their apps.\n\nThough the lawsuit was largely in Apple\u2019s favor, Epic won a similar case with Google. Given the partial victory, other developers may have been inspired to pursue their own legal actions against Apple or Google, hoping to continue carving away at Apple\u2019s chokehold on the app distribution market.",

    "raw_text": "Backline, a new security startup that uses AI agents to automatically remediate security vulnerabilities, is coming out of stealth with a $9 million seed round led by StageOne Ventures.\n\nThis is the third startup by Maor Goldberg, the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO. He previously co-founded Whitebox Security, which he sold to SailPoint in 2015, as well as container security startup Apolicy, which was acquired by Sysdig in 2021. In 2024, he left Sysdig to start Backline together with Eran Leib (chief customer officer) and Aviad Chen (VP R&D).\n\nThe idea behind Backline is that developers and security teams are drowning in security alerts.\n\n\u201cThe one thing we\u2019ve seen constantly, almost day-in, day-out, is that we as an industry drown large organizations with problems,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThey buy Sysdig, they buy Wizz, they buy Snyk \u2014 all of these great companies and great names. Their job is to go to customers and tell them where they have problems. The reality is that these security teams are buying these tools, but they can\u2019t fix most of these problems.\u201d\n\nThe security teams, after all, rely on engineers to fix vulnerabilities, for example, or on platform engineering teams to fix misconfigurations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a need for security teams to go and chase someone else in the organization. And all of these teams, without exception, just don\u2019t have the time,\u201d he said.\n\nBackline can essentially take notifications from all of these security tools and start remediating many of the issues. The service\u2019s AI agents look at the vulnerability, create a proposal for how to fix it, implement the necessary changes, and then test them.\n\nThis testing step is crucial, Backline says, and was inspired by the way hardware teams use formal methods to test their products. This, Goldberg said, is the only way to generate trust with potential users.\n\nTo do this, the company uses off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs). \u201cAll of our intellectual property is built around picking up where [the security scanning tools] left off. There is a high-priority problem that needs to be addressed. A lot of [this is about] thinking about agents, how you collaborate together and how you bring the right people into the process,\u201d Goldberg explained.\n\nBackline\u2019s ambitions go beyond its current remediation of software vulnerabilities. Looking ahead, the company wants to tackle software supply chain issues like finding exposed secrets, fixing identity and access issues, and static application security testing.\n\n\u201cSecurity backlogs are now the number one thing keeping CISOs up at night,\u201d said Tal Slobodkin, managing partner at StageOne Ventures, and a backer of the founding team\u2019s previous startup. \u201cBackline\u2019s deep cybersecurity expertise combined with their vision for autonomous remediation present a way out of the prioritization paradigm through multiple orders of magnitude improvement in remediation velocity. We haven\u2019t talked to a single organization that claims to have their security backlog fully under control, which signals just how significant this opportunity is.\u201d\n\nEvolution Equity Partners and Gradient also invested in the seed round.",

Now, this is a marketplace, so most of that booking value is being captured by its accommodation and catering partners, but the company told TechCrunch it has an average take-rate of 17% \u2014 it takes a 10% to 12% cut from providers and another 5% to 6% from clients. Naboo generated revenue of around \u20ac10 million in 2024.\n\nThe company said 10% of French public companies listed on the CAC40 index have used its platform, and it has 10 contracts that generate more than \u20ac1 million in booking volume per year. Some of its clients include Google, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Veolia, Arkema, Thales, and Qonto.\n\nThe startup recently raised a \u20ac20 million (around $21 million) Series A round led by Notion Capital. Notably, the Series A round comes just 11 months after its seed round.\n\nWith the new money, the startup wants to automate some of the manual tasks that are currently handled by its project managers.

    "raw_text": "India\u2019s IT minister on Thursday praised DeepSeek\u2018s progress and said the country will host the Chinese AI lab\u2019s large language models on domestic servers, in a rare opening for Chinese technology in India.\n\n\u201cYou have seen what DeepSeek has done \u2014 $5.5 million and a very, very powerful model,\u201d IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Thursday, responding to criticism New Delhi has received for its own investment in AI, which has been much less than many other countries.\n\nSince 2020, India has banned more than 300 apps and services linked to China, including TikTok and WeChat, citing national security concerns. The approval to allow DeepSeek to be hosted in India appears contingent on the platform storing and processing all Indian users\u2019 data domestically, in line with India\u2019s strict data localization requirements.\n\n\u201cData privacy issues regarding DeepSeek can be addressed by hosting open source models on Indian servers,\u201d Vaishnaw said at an industry conference.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s models will likely be hosted on India\u2019s new AI Compute Facility. The facility is powered by 18,693 graphics processing units (GPUs), nearly double its initial target \u2014 almost 13,000 of those are Nvidia H100 GPUs, and about 1,500 are Nvidia H200 GPUs. Around 10,000 GPUs are ready to be deployed, and the facility is scheduled to begin operations \u201cin the coming days,\u201d according to the minister.\n\nThe facility will also offer computing services at steep discounts to firms in India. Vaishnaw said standard AI computing would be offered at a 42% discount to market rates, and high-precision computing would be discounted by 47%.\n\nThe minister\u2019s remarks come a day after DeepSeek\u2019s eponymous app was taken off Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores in Italy, after that country\u2019s data protection regulator said it was asking how the Chinese firm was using and storing Italians\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe release of DeepSeek\u2019s R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model, built on a purportedly modest budget, sent shock waves through the tech industry this week, causing chip giant Nvidia\u2019s market cap to decline by $600 billion. The model has quickly come under intense scrutiny and has sparked heated debates around copyright issues, U.S. export controls, and how even more money needs to be poured into AI efforts.\n\nBeyond hosting foreign AI models, India is also trying to drive development of AI models and related technology on its own turf. \u201cMajor chip designers are willing to work with India to develop indigenous GPUs,\u201d Vaishnaw said.\n\nVaishnaw estimated that India would see investment of $30 billion in hyperscalers and data centers over the next two to three years. One of the country\u2019s biggest conglomerates, Reliance, is planning to build what could become the world\u2019s largest data center in the city of Jamnagar, with a capacity of 3 gigawatts, Bloomberg reported last week.\n\n\u201cWe believe there are at least six major developers who can develop AI models in six to eight months on the outer limit, and four to six months on a more optimistic estimate. A common compute facility is the most important component for creating a robust AI ecosystem,\u201d Vaishnaw said.\n\nThe computing facility will also support India\u2019s broader AI initiatives. Vaishnaw said 18 AI-driven applications focusing on agriculture, climate change, and learning disabilities have been selected for initial funding.\n\nTo oversee development of these AI initiatives, India will establish a regulatory body using what Vaishnaw described as a \u201chub-and-spoke model,\u201d allowing multiple institutions to collaborate on safety frameworks. \u201cWe will be keeping our models open and application-focused,\u201d he said.",

    "raw_text": "SoftBank is in talks to invest up to $25 billion in OpenAI as part of a broader partnership that could see the Japanese conglomerate spend more than $40 billion on AI initiatives with the Microsoft-backed startup, according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe potential investment would make SoftBank OpenAI\u2019s largest single backer, the report said, surpassing Microsoft, which first invested in the ChatGPT maker in 2019. The deal comes after both companies announced last week they would jointly invest $100 billion in Stargate, a U.S. data center project for OpenAI that could expand to $500 billion over four years.\n\nSoftBank plans to invest $15 billion to $25 billion directly into OpenAI in addition to its $15 billion Stargate commitment, the report said. OpenAI will invest around $15 billion in Stargate, with SoftBank\u2019s equity investment potentially covering OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure commitment.\n\nThe talks come at a time when Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s release of its R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model, which was built on a relatively modest budget, rattled public markets this week.\n\nThe chip giant Nvidia lost as much as $589 billion in a day before making a slight recovery, as investors worried that big investments in expensive AI hardware might not be necessary if companies could achieve similar results with fewer resources.\n\nOpenAI claimed earlier this week that it had found evidence that DeepSeek used OpenAI\u2019s proprietary models to train R1 and other models through a technique called \u201cdistillation,\u201d which allows developers to achieve similar performance with smaller models at a much lower cost. The company says this would violate its terms of service, which prohibit using outputs to develop competing models.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s deal with SoftBank, which Financial Times says hasn\u2019t been finalized, represents SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s biggest bet since injecting $16 billion into WeWork. It would also reduce OpenAI\u2019s dependence on Microsoft for computing resources, with Microsoft recently agreeing to give up its position as OpenAI\u2019s exclusive cloud provider.\n\nAround 20% of Stargate\u2019s funding is expected to be equity, with the remainder financed through debt secured against assets and cash flow, the report said. OpenAI, which reached a $157 billion valuation last year, is also negotiating to become a for-profit company to facilitate additional fundraising.",

It\u2019s useful, sure, but falls short on many fronts.\n\n\u201cI think the shelf life of the current [LLM] paradigm is fairly short, probably three to five years,\u201d LeCun said. \u201cI think within five years, nobody in their right mind would use them anymore, at least not as the central component of an AI system. I think [\u2026.] we\u2019re going to see the emergence of a new paradigm for AI architectures, which may not have the limitations of current AI systems.\u201d\n\nThese \u201climitations\u201d inhibit truly intelligent behavior in machines, LeCun says. This is down to four key reasons: a lack of understanding of the physical world; a lack of persistent memory; a lack of reasoning; and a lack of complex planning capabilities.\n\n\u201cLLMs really are not capable of any of this,\u201d LeCun said. \u201cSo there\u2019s going to be another revolution of AI over the next few years. We may have to change the name of it, because it\u2019s probably not going to be generative in the sense that we understand it today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorld models\u201d\n\nThis echoes sentiments that LeCun has espoused in the past. At the heart of this is what are coming to be known as \u201cworld models\u201d that promise to help machines understand the dynamics of the real world. This includes having a memory, common sense, intuition, reasoning capabilities \u2014 traits far beyond that of current systems, which are mostly about pattern recognition.\n\nPreviously, LeCun has said this could still be some 10 years away, but today\u2019s estimate brings things closer on the horizon. Though to what extent it will get to in that time frame isn\u2019t exactly clear.\n\n\u201cLLMs are good at manipulating language, but not at thinking,\u201d LeCun said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on \u2014 having systems build mental models of the world. If the plan that we\u2019re working on succeeds, with the timetable that we hope, within three to five years we\u2019ll have systems that are a completely different paradigm. They may have some level of common sense. They may be able to learn how the world works from observing the world and maybe interacting with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decade of robotics\u201d\n\nAs impressive as generative AI is, capable of passing the bar exam or unearthing new drugs, LeCun reckons that robotics could be a central component of the next wave of AI applications in such real-world scenarios.\n\nMeta itself is doing some research work in the robotics realm, but so is the AI darling of the moment, ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. Earlier this month, new job listings emerged detailing a new OpenAI robotics team focused on \u201cgeneral-purpose,\u201d \u201cadaptive,\u201d and \u201cversatile\u201d robots capable of human-like intelligence in real-world settings.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have robots that can do what a cat can do \u2014 understanding the physical world of a cat is way superior to everything we can do with AI,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the coming decade will be the decade of robotics, maybe we\u2019ll have AI systems that are sufficiently smart to understand how the real world works.\u201d",

The report found that round size increased in 2024 and investors appeared more eager to back companies that had emerged from their seed round.\n\nFor years, investors favored early-stage companies, plowing significant sums into pre-seed and seed-stage startups. That was due, in part, to the relative youth of climate tech. After a brief winter following clean tech\u2019s implosion alongside the Great Recession that began in December 2007, founders and investors reworked their approach, tackling new markets and technologies.\n\nThat shift fueled early-stage opportunities. As those startups have matured, they\u2019ve started to capture larger, later-stage rounds with higher valuations, PitchBook data shows.\n\nIn 2024, median deal size was $7 million, up $1 million from the year before, while median pre-money valuations soared to $44.5 million from $31.5 million the prior year. Deal count was down 27% to 568. In 2023, climate tech startups raised a total of $13.9 billion across 782 deals.\n\nClimate tech\u2019s numbers from last year also reflect broader market trends. Deal count was down across all sectors, though deal value edged up closer to 2022 levels largely on the strength of AI-related investments in companies like Anthropic, Databricks, OpenAI, xAI, and Waymo, which collectively garnered 43.2% of all deal value in Q4.\n\nThe lull in climate tech investments comes as investors are nursing something of a hangover following exuberance during the pandemic.

    "raw_text": "Anthony Levandowski buys Elon\u2019s vision for the future\n\nAnthony Levandowski, the engineer who co-founded Google\u2019s self-driving car program (AKA Waymo) and has gone on to start an off-road AV startup, hopped on the phone with me after Tesla\u2019s big robotaxi reveal to share his thoughts. And he is bullish on Elon Musk\u2019s vision for Tesla\u2019s and the world\u2019s future, but he\u2019s not without his, albeit small, reservations.\n\n\u201cI think the issue isn\u2019t building the car without a steering wheel, it\u2019s making the software work,\u201d Levandowski told TechCrunch. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gap between driving around on a track at an amusement park and driving around in Los Angeles traffic. The optimism is there. The realism is what\u2019s coming next, and that will be where the hard part is.\u201d\n\nThe engineer agreed with Musk\u2019s vision-only approach to self-driving, rather than using \u201cexpensive sensors,\u201d and said full self-driving appears to be in reach. He noted that while Waymo already has fully operational driverless robotaxis in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, it\u2019s a \u201cmuch more engineer-heavy and sensory-heavy approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut to scale that out to the masses, you need something that\u2019s affordable,\u201d he said. Levandowski noted that he was really looking for Tesla to announce breakthroughs in its FSD software, which it will need if it wants to get to unsupervised FSD by next year.\n\nWhen it comes to the business model, Levandowski said he loved the idea of the Cybercabs being available for sale eventually.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re putting the power back into the people\u2019s hands, where a small business owner could have, you know, a fleet of 10 cars or 20 cars that they run themselves as their business. It\u2019s a great model for the future where it\u2019s lots of mom and pops, rather than one mega corp that does that.\u201d\n\nThe engineer said he agrees with Tesla\u2019s vision of the future overall, but doesn\u2019t expect it to come anytime soon, and certainly not within the timelines Musk sets.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t start a webcast on time, maybe your prediction for 2026 is a little ambitious,\u201d Levandowski said, referencing Musk\u2019s stated timeline that the Cybercab would start production in 2026. (Also, the event apparently started late because a guest had a medical emergency, but Musk\u2019s timelines are famously too optimistic.)\n\nLevandowski also said he was bullish on the Optimus robots, which were mingling with guests at the event Thursday.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a longer term bullish,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not bullish this year. It\u2019s a bullish over time\u2026Robots in general are going to be the biggest product. They\u2019re gonna be way bigger than Tesla cars, but they\u2019re much further away than full self-driving cars.\u201d\n\nElon teases Tesla Master Plan Part 4\n\nElon Musk posted an image likely taken from the \u201cWe, Robot\u201d robotaxi reveal event, a good 24 minutes after it was meant to have started.\n\nThe image is a take on a movie poster nodding to the 1985 film \u201cBack to the Future\u201d \u2013 the Delorean in that film is one of the inspirations for Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck. The poster shows what is likely a representation of Tesla\u2019s upcoming Cybercab flying through space, its wheels turned sideways for some reason and a colorful 80\u2019s style font beneath with the words: \u201cMaster Plan IV.\u201d\n\nThe movie poster also reads: \u201cDrivers? Where we\u2019re going, we don\u2019t need drivers.\u201d Again, another throwback to \u201cBack to the Future.\u201d\n\nMusk laid out Tesla\u2019s initial vision in his Master Plan Part 1 in 2006, so this teaser signals the always-late billionaire might officially announce Part 4 of the master plan tonight.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of the other master plans:\n\nMaster Plan Part 1 (2006)\n\nThe initial vision was around achieving sustainable transportation. That involved building an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster; using that cash to build an affordable car, which ended up being the Model S; then using that money to build an even more affordable car (the Model 3). The final stage of that plan was to provide zero-emission electric power generation options, which became Tesla\u2019s solar energy storage solutions.\n\nMaster Plan Part 2 (2016)\n\nTen years later, the second part expanded on the first with its focus on sustainable energy.\n\nPart Deux involved creating solar roofs with integrated battery storage; expanding the EV lineup to over all major segments including heavy-duty trucks and pickups (hence why we have to look at the Cybertruck now); developing self-driving capabilities that are 10x safer than a human; and make self-driving cars that owners can rent out to earn money on.\n\nClearly Part 2 has not been fully realized.\n\nMaster Plan Part 3 (2023)\n\nAnd yet the Master Plans continue. This one is still about the shift to sustainable energy using renewable power sources and battery storage, including switching home, business, and industrial heating to heat pumps. Then, the plan involves scaling Tesla\u2019s manufacturing capabilities to \u201cextreme size,\u201d spanning across industries including energy and AI. Finally, Tesla envisions developing a sustainable energy economy that can support billions of people and cut global emissions.\n\nThe third Master Plan is obviously the least specific, but let\u2019s see if tonight\u2019s big event reveals anything new.",

    "raw_text": "Climate change increased the likelihood of the recent Southern California wildfires by 35%, according to a new study published by World Weather Attribution, a decade-old international group of climate scientists and other experts.\n\nThe study comes as Los Angeles residents start to rebuild their lives in the wake of catastrophic fires that erupted earlier this month. The fires were sparked by near perfect conditions: The two preceding years were unusually wet, boosting the growth of wildfire-adapted vegetation. This year, climate change dealt the region two heavy blows \u2014 a delayed annual rainy season and intense Santa Ana winds that fanned the flames and spread embers far and wide.\n\nThese extreme weather conditions will be more common, according to the study, adding fresh urgency to a burgeoning group of climate adaptation startups that hope to blunt the impact of wildfires.\n\nThe extreme weather conditions are now likely to occur once every 17 years. \u201cCompared to a 1.3\u00b0C cooler climate this is an increase in likelihood of about 35%,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cThis trend is however not linear,\u201d they added, stating that the frequency of fire-prone years has been increasing rapidly in recent years.\n\nSouthern California is no stranger to fire. Its ecosystems have evolved to handle \u2014 and even thrive under \u2014 regular, low-intensity wildfires. But over a century of fire suppression disrupted the natural regime, and in its absence, people have built deeper into fire-adapted ecosystems.\n\nToday, these areas are known as the wildland-urban interface, or WUI, and the density of housing there complicates the picture. Because the landscape has been carved up into smaller parcels, removing excess vegetation often falls on individual homeowners, who may not realize they\u2019re responsible for the task.\n\nElsewhere, it\u2019s often best to introduce prescribed burning, in which land managers start low-intensity fires during weather conditions that make the low-intensity blaze easy to contain and direct. The process helps rebalance the ecosystem and prevent dry brush from building up. But even in places where prescribed burning is possible, it\u2019s still difficult to introduce, requiring public buy-in and well-trained crews.\n\nStartups have stepped into the void. Vibrant Planet has developed a platform that helps utilities and land managers analyze a range of data to determine where wildfire risk is highest. Then it helps them work with a range of stakeholders, including landowners, conservation organizations, and indigenous groups, to develop plans to mitigate the risk.\n\nOnce plans are in place, other startups step in to do the dirty work. One company, Kodama, retrofits forestry equipment for remote operation, allowing forests to be thinned at lower costs, reducing the fuel load that can lead to catastrophic wildfire.\n\nAnother, BurnBot, has developed a remotely operated machine that does the work of a prescribed burn in the relative safety of its metal shroud. There, propane torches burn vegetation as it slides under the machine. Fans on top of the machine keep air flowing into the burn chamber, raising the fire\u2019s temperature to reduce smoke and embers. At the rear of the machine, rollers and water misters extinguish any flames or embers that remain on the ground.\n\nBut even with vegetation management and prescribed burning, the climate and ecosystems of Southern California won\u2019t be completely wildfire free. To further minimize the risk of catastrophic fires, another slate of startups is working to spot wildfires soon after they ignite so crews can respond quickly.\n\nPano, for example, uses AI to crunch a range of data sources, including cameras, satellite imagery, field sensors, and emergency alerts, to automatically detect new fires. Google is also in the game, having worked with Muon Space to launch FireSat, which can image wildfires from orbit every 20 minutes.\n\nAnd should wildfires escape early detection and containment, other startups like FireDome are developing tools to protect homes and businesses. The Israel-based startup has created an AI-assisted fire defense system that launches projectiles filled with fire retardants. The automated system can lay down a perimeter of retardant before fire reaches a property, or if embers are already flying, it can target hot spots to extinguish flames before they turn into conflagrations.\n\nLand owners and managers will have to get smarter about how to limit their risk. There\u2019s unlikely to be a single solution, but rather a combination of advanced technology and old-fashioned land management.",

    "raw_text": "The AI startup market is sprawling, from companies looking to develop new chips, to those using AI to build robots, to others looking to use AI to create niche solutions for industry-specific workflows. There are a lot of potential areas for venture capitalists to invest in, but there are clearly a few subsectors they are more excited about than others.\n\nTechCrunch recently surveyed 20 VCs who invest in startups looking to sell to enterprises about their predictions for 2025.\n\nMark Rostick, a vice president and senior managing director at Intel Capital, told TechCrunch that now that the large foundational models have been established \u2014 at least in his opinion \u2014 the next interesting area to invest in is AI solutions for specific tasks.\n\n\u201cI find models that excel at specific functions particularly intriguing, especially when combined with agents built on top of them,\u201d Rostick said. \u201cAs AI adoption accelerates, application-focused companies will take center stage, as CEOs increasingly seek ways to leverage AI in specific areas that deliver tangible, transformative impact.\u201d\n\nThis was echoed by Mike Hayes, a managing director at Insight Partners. He added that he\u2019ll be looking to back companies building products that use AI to reduce business friction.\n\n\u201cI look for solutions that solve unique, orthogonal challenges for enterprises \u2014 areas where traditional solutions have fallen short,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThis includes vertical and persona-specific workflows reimagined with GenAI or agentic automation and security innovations that do not only identify and alert, but also remediate.\u201d\n\nVCs interested in going after companies that target specific enterprise use cases will have to make sure these startup solutions are in fact companies, as opposed to just features. Otherwise, we could see a repeat of the SaaS boom in 2021, when a lot of companies that were really just one-note features raised oodles of venture capital before being left behind in favor of companies that offered platform solutions when enterprise budgets contracted in 2023.\n\nThere are of course tasks that are important enough to warrant a single-feature solution. For SaaS, we overwhelmingly heard that enterprises would still pay for companies offering specific cybersecurity solutions. For AI, what point solutions enterprises will be willing to pay for isn\u2019t clear yet. Ed Sim, the founder and general partner at Boldstart Ventures, acknowledged this challenge.\n\n\u201cThe trick is skating to where the puck will be and also thinking through is this a feature, or a product, or a business,\u201d Sim said.\n\nAnother area VCs are excited about is reliability and resiliency. Jason Mendel, an investor at Battery Ventures, said that he\u2019s looking to invest in companies in the observability and reliability space. Liran Grinberg, the co-founder and managing partner at Team8, also has his sights set on what he calls \u201centerprise resilience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Crowdstrike software update incident demonstrated how fragile our digital world is, not only due to cyber attackers but also just mistakes,\u201d Grinberg said. \u201cWe need more resilient, anti-fragile digital infrastructure by design.\u201d\n\nAI infrastructure will also remain a hot area of investment in 2025. VCs cited that with the advancements regarding AI agents, they are looking into the infrastructure needed for enterprises to adopt the tech in addition to companies that can help figure out pricing for AI agents too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still very early innings here, and I believe that momentum for AI infrastructure will continue into 2025, particularly as agentic frameworks proliferate, new model paradigms (including reasoning) develop, edge AI advances, and UI/UX of AI applications evolve (including computer use),\u201d Janelle Teng, a vice president at Bessemer Venture Partners, said.",

    "raw_text": "Jeff Horing\u2019s Insight Partners is to New York venture capital what Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia are to Silicon Valley. And it\u2019s a status that has been cemented with Insight\u2019s latest closing.\n\nAs expected, Insight Partners announced Thursday that it closed another giant flagship fund, known as Fund XIII, along with its second Opportunity fund, collectively $12.5 billion in new capital. An opportunity fund is generally money set aside to reinvest in existing portfolio companies when they raise new rounds.\n\nIn September, it was rumored to be working on a $10 billion-plus fund. Insight clearly achieved that target, and then some. With this fund it now has $90 billion of assets under management.\n\nAn Insight spokesperson declined to divulge how many billions are in each new fund but part of the money is also in what it calls a \u201cdedicated buyout co-invest fund.\u201d The spokesperson said this money will be used for buyout software investments, an established area for the 30-year-old firm.\n\nThis raise signals that Insight has no intention of ceding the top dog spot to upstart New York powerhouse VC, Thrive. In 2024, Josh Kushner\u2019s Thrive led and co-led many of the biggest deals from OpenAI\u2019s $6.6 billion round to the $100 million Series B of Anysphere, the maker of AI coding assistant Cursor.\n\nInsight isn\u2019t ceding any ground. For instance, the VC firm won the co-lead of Databricks\u2019 record-breaking $10 billion fundraising deal in December, alongside Thrive. It tapped into funds from its Partners Public Equities fund to do so, a fund set up to buy public stocks. This fresh capital will help it pursue, perhaps even lead, more deals.",

When the chip maker announced GR00T in March of last year, it was heralded as a watershed moment from humanoid robotics. Most of the category\u2019s biggest names were available from launch, including 1X Technologies, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Fourier Intelligence, Sanctuary AI, and Unitree Robotics.\n\nAt CES on Monday, CEO Jensen Huang unveiled another essential aspect of GR00T: Blueprint. The new modality is based around imitation learning, a fundamental aspect of teaching robots a new skill. It\u2019s doubly important in the world of humanoids, whose designs are based on the one doing the teaching.\n\nImitation learning is what it sounds like. A person performs an action and the robot follows suit. It\u2019s an effective method of educating systems that are designed to automate existing tasks, like those in factories and warehouses, where the first several rounds of humanoids are being deployed.\n\nTeleoperation has a fundamental role to play in all of this. It can be used to teach robots remotely, instantly digitizing one\u2019s actions through an approximation of a real-life environment.\n\nWith GR00T Blueprint, users can create these actions by using Apple\u2019s Vision Pro. The process is captured as a digital twin, which the robot can then repeatedly execute in simulation.",

    "raw_text": "Stockholm startup Neko Health has made a big bet on consumers wanting to learn about their state of health and how to prevent things going wrong. Now investors are making a big bet on Neko.\n\nThe startup has raised a fresh $260 million in funding, a Series B that values Neko at $1.8 billion post-money, TechCrunch has learned exclusively.\n\nNeko will be using the capital to break into new markets like the U.S.; to continue developing its diagnostics, potentially with acquisitions; and to open more clinics in response to demand. It has already made at least one piece of M&A: Hjalmar Nilsonne, Neko\u2019s CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch in an interview that the engineer-heavy Neko quietly acquired a startup developing sensors to enhance its data capture. He declined to disclose the name of the startup.\n\nWith Neko\u2019s waitlist now at over 100,000 people \u2014 up from 40,000 just a few months ago \u2014 the startup says that it has scanned and evaluated 10,000 patients to date in clinics in Stockholm and in its newer market of London.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that there\u2019s incredible demand for a different way of thinking about healthcare,\u201d said Nilsonne. He spoke to TechCrunch over a video link from New York, where he is working on laying the groundwork for setting up clinics in the U.S. market.\n\nThe U.S. is a priority, he said, because right now it accounts for the most people on its waitlist outside of Europe. \u201cOf course, we want to come to the U.S. We think there\u2019s a lot we could contribute to the ecosystem here, made possible by this funding round,\u201d he added.\n\nLightspeed Venture Partners, a new investor in the company, is leading this Series B, with General Catalyst, O.G. Venture Partners, Rosello, Lakestar, and Atomico participating. The round follows a Series A of $65 million in 2023 from Lakestar, Atomico, General Catalyst, and Prima Materia, the investment firm co-founded by Spotify\u2019s Daniel Ek, who happens to be the other co-founder of Neko. Prima Materia also seeded Neko with its initial funding but is not an investor in this latest round.\n\nThe funding and Neko\u2019s growth are coming at a time when demands are shifting in the world of healthcare.\n\nAround the world, whether healthcare systems are state-backed or privatized, there\u2019s been a rising focus on preventative healthcare to spot signs before they develop into problems, including to offset the costs of handling chronic and complex conditions in populations that are living longer than before.\n\nAlongside that, there has been a massive injection of technology into the worlds of medicine and health: New devices, new insights, and applications powered by, for example, artificial intelligence are changing how doctors are interacting with patients, what they are able to diagnose, and what patients are looking for in a medical environment.\n\nNot all of these advances are evolving seamlessly \u2014 very far from it \u2014 but they show few signs of going away, and Neko is playing into all of these changes.\n\nThe Neko Health experience involves a visit to a clinic \u2014 calm, futuristic, minimalist \u2014 where, for \u00a3300, a customer gets an hour-long exam based around proprietary hardware and software. That exam generates \u201cmillions of health data points,\u201d Neko says.\n\nMoles and other marks on your skin are detected and counted as part of a check for skin cancer; waist circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, heart rate, grip strength and other parameters are measured and used to determine whether you are at risk of metabolic syndrome, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, and more. The visit includes a consultation with a doctor and recommendations for follow-ups if needed.\n\nThose follow-ups might come shortly after the initial visit \u2014 for example, further monitoring of blood pressure or heart activity \u2014 or it might be another full appointment the following year. Nilsonne said that currently 80% of its customers have rebooked and paid in advance for appointments in a year\u2019s time.\n\nConsidering Neko is a company that has staked its whole ethos on the power of data and advanced planning, it had a fairly random start in life.\n\nIt was co-founded back in 2018 after Ek reached out to Nilsonne over Twitter to chat about the state of the healthcare market in response to a tweet of Nilsonne\u2019s. Neither have backgrounds in the field \u2014 Nilsson\u2019s previous startup was in climate tech \u2014 but through ongoing conversations, early ideas for Neko began to form.\n\nIt took six years to bring together a team and work out Neko\u2019s vertically integrated approach. Even so, Nilsonne said that Neko went into the market hoping for the best but unsure if their idea would resonate; now, according to the company, demand exceeds capacity.\n\nLooking ahead, along with building more clinics to take in more users, Neko is focused on R&D around its medical hardware and software.\n\nIt\u2019s starting from a fairly low-tech baseline because of the costs of building and owning medical devices. \u201cThe average ECG machine in primary care is 15 years old, meaning the software is 15 years old,\u201d Nilsonne said. \u201cWe have a completely different model where we\u2019re vertically integrated, meaning we make these devices, we make the software, and we have the clinic.\u201d\n\nHe added that Neko\u2019s aim is to have updates on a yearly cadence, bringing in more parameters to measure, and likely different tiers of service at different price points.\n\n\u201cThe body scan today is kind of the iPod moment for Neko,\u201d he said. \u201cThe iPod was an iconic product that people loved, and that was exciting. But no one today is using an iPod. It enabled Apple to invest in this incredible paradigm of handheld computational devices. So we very much see this as the beginning of a journey where we\u2019re trying to contribute, you know, incredibly affordable, high-quality preventative diagnostics, and every year we\u2019re going to be able to do more and more with less and less.\u201d\n\nThe funding round, he said, will \u201callow us to double down and really increase our investments in making the product better, which is ultimately about solving some of the core problems in healthcare.\u201d\n\nIt will also give Neko a chance to put more space between itself and others looking at preventative healthcare opportunities, such as Zoi in France and Aware in Germany. The capital could also set it apart from public health services, such as the Health Check provided by the NHS in the U.K., which covers many of the same areas that Neko does.\n\nSome weeks ago, I heard from one of Neko\u2019s early backers that some of the most insistent waitlisters were investors who wanted to check out the company firsthand for the health of their bodies and of their funds.\n\nIt seems that getting Lightspeed off the waitlist quickly yielded a strong result. As part of this funding round, Lightspeed partner Bejul Somaia will join Neko\u2019s board.",

    "raw_text": "Hackers are exploiting outdated versions of WordPress and plug-ins to alter thousands of websites in an attempt to trick visitors to download and install malware, security researchers have found.\n\nThe hacking campaign is still \u201cvery much live,\u201d Simon Wijckmans, the founder and CEO of web security company c/side, which discovered the attacks, told TechCrunch on Tuesday.\n\nThe hackers\u2019 goal is to spread malware capable of stealing passwords and other personal information from both Windows and Mac users. Some of the hacked websites are ranked among the most popular sites on the internet, according to c/side.\n\n\u201cThis is a widespread and very commercialized attack,\u201d Himanshu Anand, who wrote up the company\u2019s findings, told TechCrunch. Anand said the campaign is a \u201cspray and pray\u201d attack that aims to compromise anyone who visits these websites rather than targeting a specific person or group of people.\n\nWhen the hacked WordPress sites load in a user\u2019s browser, the content quickly changes to display a fake Chrome browser update page, requesting the website visitor download and install an update in order to view the website, the researchers found. If a visitor accepts the update, the hacked website will prompt the visitor to download a specific malicious file masquerading as the update, depending on whether the visitor is on a Windows PC or a Mac.\n\nWijckmans said that they alerted Automattic, the company that develops and distributes WordPress.com, about the hacking campaign and sent them the list of malicious domains, and that their contact at the company acknowledged receipt of their email.\n\nWhen reached by TechCrunch prior to publication, Megan Fox, a spokesperson for Automattic, did not comment by press time. After publication, Automattic said that security of third-party plugins are ultimately the responsibility of WordPress plugin developers.\n\n\u201cThere are specific guidelines that plugin authors must consult and adhere to ensure the overall quality of their plugins and the safety of their users. In addition, they have at their disposal a Plugin Handbook that covers numerous security topics, including best practices and managing plugins\u2019 security,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nC/side said it identified over 10,000 websites that appear to have been compromised as part of this hacking campaign. Wijckmans said the company detected malicious scripts on several domains by crawling the internet, and performing a reverse DNS lookup, a technique to find domains and websites associated with a certain IP address, which revealed more domains hosting the malicious scripts.\n\nTechCrunch could not confirm the accuracy of c/side\u2019s figures, but we saw one hacked WordPress website that was still displaying the malicious content on Tuesday.\n\nFrom WordPress to infostealing malware\n\nThe two types of malware that are being pushed on the malicious websites are known as Amos (or Amos Atomic Stealer), which targets macOS users; and SocGholish, which targets Windows users.\n\nIn May 2023, cybersecurity firm SentinelOne published a report on Amos, classifying the malware as an infostealer, a type of malware designed to infect computers and steal as many usernames and passwords, session cookies, crypto wallets, and other sensitive data that allows the hackers to further break into the victim\u2019s accounts and steal their digital currency. Cybersecurity firm Cyble reported at the time that it had found that hackers were selling access to the Amos malware on Telegram.\n\nPatrick Wardle, a macOS security expert and co-founder of Apple-focused cybersecurity startup DoubleYou, told TechCrunch that Amos is \u201cdefinitively the most prolific stealer on macOS,\u201d and was created with the malware-as-a-service business model, meaning the developers and owners of the malware sell it to the hackers who then deploy it.\n\nWardle also noted that for someone to successfully install on macOS the malicious file found by c/side \u201cthe user still has to then manually run it, and jump through a lot of hoops to bypass Apple\u2019s built-in security.\u201d\n\nWhile this may not be the most advanced hacking campaign, given that the hackers rely on their targets to fall for the fake update page and then install the malware, this is a good reminder to update your Chrome browser through its in-built software update feature and to install only trusted apps on your personal devices.\n\nPassword-stealing malware and the theft of credentials have been blamed for some of the biggest hacks and data breaches in history. In 2024, hackers mass-raided the accounts of corporate giants who hosted their sensitive data with cloud computing giant Snowflake by using passwords stolen from the computers of employees of Snowflake\u2019s customers.\n\nThis story was updated to include comment from Automattic\u2019s spokesperson.",

    "raw_text": "At CES 2025, German Bionic announced the Apogee Ultra, a new robotic exoskeleton it claims is the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful.\u201d What did the system do to earn such a lofty title? It offers up to 80 pounds of dynamic lift assistance. That means a payload of 70 pounds feels more like nine to 11 pounds to the lifter\u2019s lower back.\n\nIn addition to lift assistance, the Apogee Ultra also assists walks, making a 10-mile journey feel more like eight. The company is aiming for industries like baggage handling and construction, as well as those that require workers to be on their feet and walking great distances, such as nursing.\n\nBroadly speaking, the goal of robotic exoskeletons is augmenting human labor, rather than automating it out of existence. Effectively, employers can get more done with fewer employees when performing labor-intensive tasks.\n\nThey also have the potential to lower injury rates. German Bionic claims, for example, that its exoskeletons have resulted in a 31% reduction in sick leave in the workplace.\n\nThe company says the systems have been refined, courtesy of \u201cvast amounts of high-quality, relevant data collected from thousands of users over countless hours of real-world application.\u201d\n\nThe exoskeleton also utilizes AI to better adapt to a wearer\u2019s specific needs. The company promises to support the system through over-the-air updates going forward.\n\nThe system is now available through German Bionic\u2019s site. Specific pricing had not been disclosed at the time of publication.\n\nCheck out more CES 2025 coverage, including\u2026",

    "raw_text": "ElevenLabs, one of the more popular startups working in the field of AI audio, said Thursday that it has raised a Series C round of $180 million, valuing the company at $3.3 billion post-money. a16z and ICONIQ Growth are co-leading the investment.\n\nRumors of the fundraise were first reported by TechCrunch. The final numbers confirm some but not all of the details we previously reported (specifically, the overall size of the round is smaller than we had heard; the valuation and lead investors are the same).\n\nThe funding will be used to continue building out ElevenLabs\u2019 audio tools and for business development.\n\nMati Staniszewski, the CEO who co-founded the company with childhood friend Piotr Dabkowski, said in an interview that the startup is focusing its research on building audio AI models that are more expressive and have more control. Staniszewski added that the company is also focusing on \u201comni-models\u201d: combining text-based models with its audio models for multimodal interactions.\n\nThere has been a frenzy of investor interest in ElevenLabs going back several months, on the back of two important currents. First, there has been a huge wave of hype around generative AI that has been catching a lot of companies in its wake. Second, ElevenLabs has emerged as a major player among those providing synthetic voice technology. Dozens of major publishers and content creators across verticals like media and gaming, as well as a number of other tech startups, are all using ElevenLabs\u2019 technology to power their voice and audio features.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that has translated into a very crowded funding round with a lot of prominent names.\n\nNew investors in this Series C include NEA, World Innovation Lab (WiL), Valor, Endeavor Catalyst Fund, and Abu Dhabi investment firm Lunate. Past investors also participating include Sequoia Capital, Salesforce Ventures, Smash Capital, SV Angel, NFDG, and BroadLight Capital.\n\nAlongside these, ElevenLabs is also picking up a number of new strategic backers \u2014 that is, companies using its technology who are now investing in it, too. These include Deutsche Telekom, LG Technology Ventures, HubSpot Ventures, NTT DOCOMO Ventures, and RingCentral Ventures.\n\nICONIQ partner Seth Pierrepont will join the company\u2019s board, alongside existing board members Jennifer Li from a16z and the co-founders of the company.\n\nICONIQ has been ramping up its activities around generative AI startups. Tapping into written output, the firm also co-led a $200 million round in Writer last November.\n\n\u201cWe have always felt that audio is a very important modality, and we thought there will be a very big company built in this category,\u201d Pierrepont told TechCrunch. \u201cWe have observed ElevenLabs from its launch, and we were impressed by the quality of the technology, how quickly it ascended in terms of mindshare and momentum, and the depth of domain expertise of the founders.\u201d\n\nPierrepont added that as a board member, a lot of the conversations with the company will be around creating new use cases for audio and finding the right markets for it.\n\nAt a time when startups are still finding it challenging to close growth rounds, it\u2019s notable that ElevenLabs raised its Series B round of $80 million, which valued it at $1 billion, just a year ago. ElevenLabs has raised a total of $281 million to date.\n\nThe product roadmap\n\nIn addition to a focus on improving its AI models, the company plans to use the funding to grow its conversational AI builder with an ambition to reach more consumers directly and through partnerships.\n\nLast year, the company debuted an AI conversational agent platform, and a key part of that product was developing a speech-to-text component. Staniszewski noted that the company wants to improve in that area a lot more.\n\n\u201cWe want to understand what\u2019s being said by you in a conversation better. We are working on ways to move away from only generating content and understanding and transcribing speech,\u201d Staniszewski said. \u201cMany people say that speech-to-text is a solved problem. But for many languages, it is pretty bad. We think we can build better speech detection models because we have in-house teams to annotate data and give us quick feedback.\u201d\n\nThe company also wants to double down on creating AI-powered conversational agents by supporting legacy communications like telephony and better integrating different kinds of knowledge sources. This is partly why it is partnering with telcos in this round.\n\nIt\u2019s also being used by its customers to tap into their own archives. Last year, ElevenLabs partnered with TIME publication to deploy a conversational bot for users to ask questions about TIME Person of the Year.\n\nStaniszewski said the company envisions more conversational AI agents on sites: On news sites, for example, users would be able to ask questions about stories or ask the bot to summarize them.\n\nThe CEO also noted that while AI-powered voice bots\u2019 quality has improved, the problem of sounding natural while reacting to humans speaking or emoting in different ways has not been solved yet.\n\n\u201cThe way I speak to you impacts how you react or respond to me. Sometimes, I\u2019ll be excited, or sometimes, I\u2019ll be calm, and at times, I will interrupt you. You will respond to me accordingly. Current-gen AI solutions are on the verge of being good, but they are not as good as humans,\u201d Staniszewski said.\n\nICONIQ\u2019s Pierrepont also emphasized that if AI doesn\u2019t understand you well when you are talking, machine communication breaks down and users immediately lose interest.\n\nElevenLabs has mostly grown its reach (and revenue funnel) by way of B2B partnerships. But it\u2019s also going out on a direct limb, too.\n\nIn 2024, the startup launched its first purely consumer-facing product, ElevenLabs Reader, an app that reads out articles, text, and documents. Later, the company added the ability to create a podcast with generative AI voices from documents and web pages \u2014 not unlike what you can do with Google\u2019s NotebookLM. Staniszewski said that it wants to expand into more consumer experiences.\n\nIt may actually already be doing that. TechCrunch spotted that the company has been testing a program on the ElevenLabs Reader app inviting users to publish audiobooks on the platform. The company also wants to give tools to creators to have multiple voices read out an audiobook in the future while also creating better localization.\n\nStaniszewski noted that the company is figuring out ways for users and companies to better distribute their content, including on its own app. Whether that brings it into actual direct competition with its customers will be something to watch. (That has been one reason why many B2B tech companies prefer to stay away from direct-to-consumer plays.) Notably, ElevenLabs powers voice technology for audio content platforms like Lightspeed-backed Pocket FM and Google-backed Kuku FM.\n\nElevenLabs already powers AI-generated audio on products and platforms like Perplexity, Rabbit R1, Chess.com, ESPN, Lex Fridman podcast, The Atlantic, and Synthesia. The goal for the company is to be in more places and also own an end-to-end conversation stack so it can generate more experiences and insights for its customers.\n\nSafety\n\nNot all of ElevenLabs\u2019 silver linings have been without clouds: Its tech has been implicated in a few notable misinformation campaigns. A recent report from threat intelligence company Recorded Future found that the company\u2019s product was used in a Russian propaganda operation. Last year, someone used the company\u2019s voice platform to create an audio deepfake of Joe Biden. In 2023, Motherboard reported that 4chan members allegedly used the AI audio generation tool to create voices that sounded like Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, and Emma Watson to spread problematic content.\n\nBut the company has been quick to respond. Today, it has a policy prohibiting \u201cunauthorized, harmful, or deceptive impersonation.\u201d Plus, it uses a mix of machine-led and human moderation to weed out such content. However, as the company grows its set of tools and has more direct consumer touchpoints, this opens the door to more opportunities for malicious actors to look for ways to misuse it.\n\n\u201cAs one of the frontrunners of AI audio work, we do treat it as our responsibility to build the right safety mechanism as we build out the technology. We will frequently make choices to prioritize safety over speed of deployment or commercial benefit,\u201d Staniszewski said.\n\nStaniszewski added that while the company follows C2PA, a standard to track content using metadata, it also has a public tool that allows anyone to check if audio was generated through ElevenLabs technology using digital signatures it places in the audio during generation. That could also be a track that continues to develop over time as approaches for misuse also become more sophisticated.",

Mobile companies are increasingly looking toward platforms like this \u2014 and Apple Intelligence/ChatGPT \u2014 to justify device updates that were once largely the realm of hardware advancements. But the offerings on the S25 are still driven by neural cores on the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.\n\nIn line with Apple\u2019s recent updates to Siri, Gemini offers more cross-app functionality, via Google apps like Maps, YouTube, and Messages, along with Spotify. Extensions also provides access to useful Samsung apps, including Reminder, Calendar, Notes, and Clock.\n\nMuch like Google\u2019s Home pivot, Samsung hasn\u2019t abandoned Bixby.

    "raw_text": "Boom Supersonic\u2019s XB-1 demonstrator plane just went supersonic in the skies over California\u2019s Mojave Desert, making it the first civil aircraft to break the sound barrier.\n\nThe American startup\u2019s plane notched the historic achievement in its 12th test flight. It cleared Mach 1 and stayed supersonic for around four minutes, reaching Mach 1.1. Test pilot Tristan Brandenburg broke the sound barrier two more times before receiving the call to bring the XB-1 back to the Mojave Air & Space Port.\n\nThe supersonic flight comes eight years after Boom first revealed the XB-1. It\u2019s a small, roughly one-third scale version of the 64-passenger airliner Boom eventually wants to build, which it calls Overture.\n\nBoom CEO Blake Scholl wrote in a post on X over the weekend that \u201c[m]uch work remains to scale up to Overture.\u201d That includes firing up the Overture\u2019s engine for the first time, which Boom hopes to do later this year.\n\nIf and when the company can build it, Overture already has customers in waiting: American and Japan Airlines have all placed orders for the proposed supersonic aircraft.\n\nBrandenburg landed the XB-1 safely just before 12 p.m. ET. Boom has said that a second supersonic test flight could happen in the next week or two.\n\n\u201c[T]his is supersonic flight\u2019s \u2018Falcon 1\u2019 moment,\u201d Scholl wrote over the weekend, referring to when SpaceX\u2019s first rocket reached orbit in 2008.\n\nScholl added that \u201cXB-1\u2019s supersonic flight marks the first time a supersonic jet has come from something other than a nation-state.\u201d The Concorde, which was retired in 2003, was built jointly by the British and French governments.\n\nAhead of the flight, Scholl spoke with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos for the StrictlyVC Download podcast.\n\n\u201cI think the thing we need is a rebirth of entrepreneurship in commercial aviation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need more Booms, frankly. We need more companies with great ideas finding new ways to push the envelope.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of other companies working on supersonic aircraft, though many of them are focused on defense applications. One of the only others working on supersonic aviation for the commercial space \u2014 Exosonic \u2014 shut down in November.\n\nScholl said in the interview that Boom being essentially the only startup working on commercial supersonic aircraft has been \u201chonestly a little lonely.\u201d\n\nBut Scholl said he\u2019s glad Boom has been primarily focused on commercial over defense, even though military tech is, well, booming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad there are weapons startups; they should definitely exist,\u201d Scholl said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re building, you know, effectively a hypersonic weapon, it\u2019s extremely different from something that you and I are going to get to fly on, and that\u2019s really a very distinct effort that I think really deserves to exist.\u201d\n\nBoom is doing some work with the U.S. Air Force, but Scholl said his focus remains on making supersonic passenger travel a reality again.\n\n\u201cThis is about American jobs, this is about American leadership in aviation, this is about building the future, this is about improving human connectivity across cultures,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s frankly a lot for everybody to get excited about here.\u201d",

Now those driverless vehicles are heading to the city\u2019s network of freeways.\n\nThe Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle technology company said Tuesday it will begin testing its fleet of robotaxis on the Los Angeles freeway system, including Interstates 10, 110, 405, and 90.\n\nThese robotaxis will not have a human safety operator behind the wheel. Waymo will follow the same testing-to-commercial service path as it has done in other areas. The company will first invite employees to access driverless vehicles on LA freeways and will eventually open it up to the public.\n\nUnlocking freeways is key to Waymo\u2019s business success, particularly in the sprawling cities of Phoenix and Los Angeles, where it operates today. Customers may be more likely to opt for a Waymo over another ride-hailing service or taxi if the robotaxi can take the shortest possible route \u2014 which is oftentimes accessed via freeway.\n\nFor instance, Waymo said that taking a trip from Santa Monica Pier to the Broad can be 50% faster by taking Interstate 10.\n\nWaymo has had a presence in Los Angeles since 2019, periodically coming in to map neighborhoods, including downtown, Miracle Mile, Koreatown, Santa Monica, Westwood, and West Hollywood. In 2022, the company announced Los Angeles would be one of its next commercial markets, following Phoenix and San Francisco.",

    "raw_text": "Character AI, a platform that lets users engage in roleplay with AI chatbots, has filed a motion to dismiss a case brought against it by the parent of a teen who committed suicide after allegedly becoming hooked on the company\u2019s technology.\n\nIn October, Megan Garcia filed a lawsuit against Character AI in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, over the death of her son, Sewell Setzer III. According to Garcia, her 14-year-old developed an emotional attachment to a chatbot on Character AI, \u201cDany,\u201d which he texted constantly \u2014 to the point where he began to pull away from the real world.\n\nFollowing Setzer\u2019s death, Character AI said it would roll out a number of new safety features, including improved detection, response, and intervention related to chats that violate its terms of service. But Garcia is fighting for additional guardrails, including changes that might result in chatbots on Character AI losing their ability to tell stories and personal anecdotes.\n\nIn the motion to dismiss, counsel for Character AI asserts the platform is protected against liability by the First Amendment, just as computer code is. The motion may not persuade a judge, and Character AI\u2019s legal justifications may change as the case proceeds. But the motion possibly hints at early elements of Character AI\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment prohibits tort liability against media and technology companies arising from allegedly harmful speech, including speech allegedly resulting in suicide,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cThe only difference between this case and those that have come before is that some of the speech here involves AI. But the context of the expressive speech \u2014 whether a conversation with an AI chatbot or an interaction with a video game character \u2014 does not change the First Amendment analysis.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Character AI\u2019s counsel isn\u2019t asserting the company\u2019s First Amendment rights. Rather, the motion argues that Character AI\u2019s users would have their First Amendment rights violated should the lawsuit against the platform succeed.\n\nThe motion doesn\u2019t address whether Character AI might be held harmless under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the federal safe-harbor law that protects social media and other online platforms from liability for third-party content. The law\u2019s authors have implied that Section 230 doesn\u2019t protect output from AI like Character AI\u2019s chatbots, but it\u2019s far from a settled legal matter.\n\nCounsel for Character AI also claims that Garcia\u2019s real intention is to \u201cshut down\u201d Character AI and prompt legislation regulating technologies like it. Should the plaintiffs be successful, it would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on both Character AI and the entire nascent generative AI industry, counsel for the platform says.\n\n\u201cApart from counsel\u2019s stated intention to \u2018shut down\u2019 Character AI, [their complaint] seeks drastic changes that would materially limit the nature and volume of speech on the platform,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cThese changes would radically restrict the ability of Character AI\u2019s millions of users to generate and participate in conversations with characters.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, which also names Character AI corporate benefactor Alphabet as a defendant, is but one of several lawsuits that Character AI is facing relating to how minors interact with the AI-generated content on its platform. Other suits allege that Character AI exposed a 9-year-old to \u201chypersexualized content\u201d and promoted self-harm to a 17-year-old user.\n\nIn December, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced he was launching an investigation into Character AI and 14 other tech firms over alleged violations of the state\u2019s online privacy and safety laws for children. \u201cThese investigations are a critical step toward ensuring that social media and AI companies comply with our laws designed to protect children from exploitation and harm,\u201d said Paxton in a press release.\n\nCharacter AI is part of a booming industry of AI companionship apps \u2014 the mental health effects of which are largely unstudied. Some experts have expressed concerns that these apps could exacerbate feelings of loneliness and anxiety.\n\nCharacter AI, which was founded in 2021 by Google AI researcher Noam Shazeer, and which Google reportedly paid $2.7 billion to \u201creverse acquihire,\u201d has claimed that it continues to take steps to improve safety and moderation. In December, the company rolled out new safety tools, a separate AI model for teens, blocks on sensitive content, and more prominent disclaimers notifying users that its AI characters are not real people.\n\nCharacter AI has gone through a number of personnel changes after Shazeer and the company\u2019s other co-founder, Daniel De Freitas, left for Google. The platform hired a former YouTube exec, Erin Teague, as chief product officer, and named Dominic Perella, who was Character AI\u2019s general counsel, interim CEO.\n\nCharacter AI recently began testing games on the web in an effort to boost user engagement and retention.",

    "raw_text": "AngelSense, an assistive technology company that provides location monitoring devices for people with disabilities, was spilling the personally identifiable information and precise location data of its users to the open internet, TechCrunch has learned.\n\nThe company secured the exposed server on Monday, more than a week after it was alerted to the data leak by researchers at security firm UpGuard.\n\nUpGuard shared details of the exposure exclusively with TechCrunch after AngelSense resolved the lapse. UpGuard has since published a blog post on the incident.\n\nThe New Jersey-based AngelSense provides GPS trackers and location monitoring to thousands of customers, according to its mobile app listing, and is touted by law enforcement and police departments across the United States.\n\nAccording to UpGuard\u2019s researchers, AngelSense left an internal database exposed to the internet without a password, allowing anyone to access the data inside using only a web browser and knowledge of the database\u2019s public IP address. The database was storing real-time updating logs from an AngelSense system, which included the personal information of AngelSense customers, as well as technical logs about the company\u2019s systems.\n\nUpGuard said it found customers\u2019 personal data, like names, postal addresses, and phone numbers in the exposed database. The researchers said they also found GPS coordinates of individuals being monitored \u2014 including associated health information about the tracked person, which included conditions like autism and dementia. The researchers also found email addresses, passwords, and authentication tokens for accessing customer accounts, as well as partial credit card information \u2014 all of which was visible in plaintext, UpGuard said.\n\nIt\u2019s not known exactly how long the database was exposed nor how many customers were affected. According to the database\u2019s listing on Shodan, a search engine of internet-facing devices and systems, AngelSense\u2019s exposed logging database was first spotted online on January 14, though it may have been exposed some time earlier.\n\nAngelSense chief executive Doron Somer confirmed to TechCrunch that the company took the exposed server offline after initially identifying UpGuard\u2019s first email as spam.\n\n\u201cIt was only when UpGuard phoned us that the issue was raised to our attention,\u201d Somer said. \u201cUpon its discovery, we acted promptly to validate the information provided to us and to remedy the vulnerability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe note that other than UpGuard, we have no information suggesting that any data on the logging system potentially was accessed. Nor do we have any evidence or indication that the data has been misused or is under threat of misuse,\u201d Somer told TechCrunch, claiming that the data \u201cwas not sensitive personal information.\u201d\n\nSomer would not say if the company has the technical means to determine if there was any access to the unprotected server prior to UpGuard\u2019s discovery.\n\nWhen asked if the company planned to notify affected customers and individuals whose data was exposed, Somer said the company was still investigating.\n\n\u201cIf notice to regulators or persons is warranted, we will of course provide it,\u201d Somer said.\n\nSomer did not respond to a follow-up inquiry by press time.",

The feature is available on desktop and mobile for users who have opted into the company\u2019s Search Labs experiments.\n\nThe idea is to help users access information without having to actually pick up the phone and talk to someone.\n\nTo start, Ask for Me can be used to inquire about services at nail salons and auto shops.\n\nIf you are enrolled in Search Labs, you can access the new feature by searching for local services like \u201coil change\u201d or \u201cnail salons nearby.\u201d You will then see an \u201cAsk for me\u201d option with a \u201cGet started\u201d button.\n\nYou\u2019re then prompted to enter details about that service, such as a \u201ctire replacement,\u201d \u201cfactory scheduled maintenance,\u201d \u201cfrench manicure,\u201d \u201cnail art,\u201d and more. From there, you can enter information about time frame. Google\u2019s AI will then make calls to local businesses on your behalf and send you a summary of prices and availability.\n\nThe launch comes as Google has been looking for ways to help users save time when contacting businesses with the help of AI. Last year, the company released a feature called \u201cTalk to a Live Rep\u201d that places a call to a business on your behalf, waits on hold, and then gives you a call once a live representative is available.\n\nThe feature gets rid of the need for users to wait countless minutes, and sometimes hours, listening to hold music trying to get connected to a customer service agent.\n\nIn terms of other Search Labs features, Google recently launched \u201cDaily Listen,\u201d which is a personalized AI-powered audio experience designed to help you stay up to date with a personalized news feed.",

    "raw_text": "With data centers expected to consume as much as 12% of electricity in the U.S. by 2028, it\u2019s no surprise that tech companies are looking for power no matter the source, whether it be nuclear, renewables, or something else entirely. But solar produces a very different type of electric current from a nuclear plant, and integrating various power sources can be challenging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got about 90 gigawatts [of data centers] globally in 2023, and that\u2019s going to increase to over 185 gigawatts by 2028, so it\u2019s only just around the corner,\u201d Gary Lawrence, CEO of Amperesand, told TechCrunch.\n\nToday\u2019s equipment, the transformers that convert power from one format to another, are up to the task, but Amperesand is betting that its technology can do it better and more efficiently.\n\nAt its core, Amperesand\u2019s technology replaces the iron cores that define old transformers with silicon carbide. Existing transformers follow the same basic design that has worked well for over a century, but they have their shortcomings. For one, they aren\u2019t good at regulating surges and dips in voltage or frequency. Plus, they have to be tailored to the specific format of electricity they\u2019re looking to transform.\n\nSolid-state transformers made with silicon carbide promise to change that. \u201cThe solid-state transformer platform is multi-port by design; it\u2019s modular,\u201d said Brian Dow, Amperesand\u2019s new chief product officer.\n\n\u201cWe can make different AC phases, AC to AC, AC to DC. You can natively integrate DC sources like photovoltaic [solar] and batteries. You can integrate with turbines, small modular reactors. And you can basically seamlessly transition between them, so if the grid has an issue, you can back up but also you can come back online.\u201d\n\nAmperesand is in the process of raising a Series A round after it landed a $12.5 million seed round last year, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019ve just kicked off a Series A, and it\u2019s moving really quickly,\u201d said Phil Inagaki, managing partner at Temasek\u2019s Xora Innovation. The company is targeting EV charging and grid applications in addition to data centers, and the solid-state nature of the technology makes it easier to control with software. It demonstrated a 6 megawatt transformer last year.\n\nXora incubated Amperesand, and Inagaki led the company through its initial formation. Recently, with some funding and a firm strategy in place, he handed the reins to a new leadership team, including Lawrence, Dow, and Tommy Joyner, the company\u2019s new chief technology officer.\n\nThe Singapore-based startup is also in the process of opening an office here in the U.S. to be closer to the massive market and to tap local talent. Dow and Joyner, for example, both did stints at Tesla and Generac.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is still where there\u2019s amazing talent that we can capture,\u201d Inagaki said. \u201cWe have some in Singapore, but we won\u2019t be able to scale that quickly. So definitely, that talent angle was a big factor.\u201d",

According to a test by information-reliability organization NewsGuard, R1 provides inaccurate answers or non-answers 83% of the time when asked about news-related topics. A separate test found that R1 refuses to answer 85% of prompts related to China, possibly a consequence of the government censorship to which AI models developed in the country are subject.",

Another $5.66 billion has yet to be dispersed.\n\nThe company was awarded a total of $7.86 billion in federal grants to build semiconductors in the U.S. in November as part of the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. While a sizable sum, this total was less than the original $8.5 billion estimate.\n\nWhen Intel was awarded its grant money in November, the company said it was planning to put the funds toward manufacturing and advanced packaging, or toward techniques to assemble and integrate multiple semiconductor chips into one package. This will be carried out at Intel facilities across Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.\n\nThe U.S. CHIPS and Science Act was signed into federal law by former president Joe Biden in 2022 in an effort to increase domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The act set aside $52 billion in subsidies for domestic chip manufacturers.\n\nWhile already two years old, the CHIPS Act faces some uncertainty under the Trump administration. If President Donald Trump\u2019s federal funding freeze, which is currently being blocked by a federal judge, does go into effect, it would affect the Commerce Department employees focused on the CHIPS Act, according to Bloomberg reporting.\n\nZinsner had a rosier outlook, though. When asked by an analyst, he said that Intel has already been in communication with the Trump administration and \u201cfeels really good\u201d about the administration\u2019s outlook on bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to continued engagement with the Trump administration as we advance this work and support their efforts to strengthen U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,\u201d Zinsner said earlier on the call.",

The models can parse files, understand videos, and count objects in images, as well as control a PC \u2014 similar to the model powering OpenAI\u2019s recently launched Operator.\n\nPer the Qwen team\u2019s benchmarking, the best Qwen2.5-VL model beats OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash on a range of video understanding, math, document analysis, and question-answering evaluations.\n\nQwen2.5-VL, which is available to test in Alibaba\u2019s Qwen Chat app and to download from AI dev platform Hugging Face, can analyze charts and graphics, extract data from scans of invoices and forms, and \u201ccomprehend\u201d multiple-hours-long videos, the Qwen team says. Qwen2.5-VL can also recognize \u201cIPs from film and TV series, as well as a wide variety of products,\u201d per the team \u2014 suggesting that the models might\u2019ve been trained in part on copyrighted works.\n\nQwen2.5-VL, being AI developed by a Chinese company, has certain restrictions on the topics it will discuss \u2014 at least in Qwen Chat. When I asked the largest and most capable Qwen2.5-VL model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, to talk about \u201cXi Jinping\u2019s mistakes,\u201d Qwen Chat threw an error message.\n\nChina\u2019s internet regulator benchmarks many models developed in the country to ensure their responses \u201cembody core socialist values.\u201d Many Chinese AI systems decline to respond to topics that might raise the ire of regulators, such as Taiwan\u2019s autonomy.\n\nOne of Qwen2.5-VL\u2019s more interesting features is its ability to interact with software \u2014 both on PCs and mobile devices. A video posted on X by Philipp Schmid, a technical lead at Hugging Face, showed Qwen2.5-VL launching the Booking.com app for Android and booking a flight from Chongqing to Beijing.\n\nIn the video below, a Qwen2.5-VL model controls apps on a Linux desktop \u2014 but doesn\u2019t seem to accomplish much beyond switching tabs. Perhaps tellingly, Qwen\u2019s benchmarking shows Qwen2.5-VL scoring poorly on OSWorld, a benchmark that tries to mimic a real computer environment.\n\nThe two smaller, less sophisticated models in the Qwen2.5-VL series, Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, are available under a permissive license. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B, however, is under Alibaba\u2019s custom license, which requires that companies and devs with more than 100 million monthly active users request permission from Qwen/Alibaba before deploying the model commercially.",

Intel Capital\u2019s original mission was to support the development of Intel\u2019s ecosystem through equity investments in strategic companies.\n\nIntel rivals AMD and Nvidia followed suit with their own venture funds. Nvidia in particular has been aggressive with its investments, last year pouring around $1 billion into AI companies.\n\nToday, Intel Capital has over $5 billion in assets under management. Over the last 30 years or so, it has invested in more than 1,800 companies in sectors like silicon, 5G, devices, and cloud. Altogether, Intel Capital has deployed more than $20 billion in cash across markets including North America, Western Europe, Israel, and Asia Pacific.\n\nSince 2014, Intel Capital has upped its investments in AI startups. Some of its more notable portfolio companies are AI chip startup SambaNova, Israeli AI company AI21 Labs, humanoid robotics firm Figure, and AI developer platform Anyscale.\n\nIntel\u2019s decision to spin out Intel Capital comes after the company\u2019s board of directors forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger last month and appointed in his place Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs. Holthaus is also CEO of Intel Products, a recently created division spanning the chipmaker\u2019s consumer-focused org as well as its data center, AI, network, and edge businesses.\n\nIntel has had a rough go of it lately. Last October, the company posted a $16.6 billion quarterly loss \u2014 the biggest in its 56-year history. And 2024 was Intel\u2019s worst year since going public in 1971.\n\nIn a bid to streamline operations and cut costs, Intel made moves to spin out another of its business divisions, Intel Foundry, which is responsible for chip fabrication, in September. Intel is in the midst of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan, which included laying off 15,000 staffers. And the company is said to have considered selling its driverless vehicle arm Mobileye and its enterprise and cloud networking division.",

    "raw_text": "CES 2025 has been a mixed bag for humanoid robots. The form factor had a watershed moment, as images of the top players flanked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his Monday keynote.\n\nOf these, Agility\u2019s Digit also showed up alongside a miniature conveyer belt at a closed-access Nvidia booth. It was a nice return for the bipedal robot, an older form of which appeared at CES 2020 as part of Ford\u2019s showcase.\n\nBeyond this, humanoid representation has largely been limited to smaller companies, with the exception of Apptronik. The Austin firm\u2019s Apollo robot made an appearance as part of Texas Instruments\u2019 presence at the show. The humanoid utilizes some of the Dallas-based semiconductor giant\u2019s modules internally.\n\nAfter a few near misses, this was the first time I\u2019ve seen Apollo in-person. When Apptronik showed TechCrunch the first footage of the robot in 2023, I had to double check that it wasn\u2019t an animated render. There\u2019s something other-worldly about the robot. It\u2019s honestly refreshing, as so much of the competition has offered similar aesthetic visions for humanoids: dark, sterile, even apocalyptic.\n\nApollo is bright and almost cartoony, with a pair of big eyes and a head shape that brings back warm memories of early iMacs. Like other first-gen humanoids, Apollo will largely focus on factory work, but just because it\u2019s destined for an industrial setting doesn\u2019t mean it has to be unwelcoming and cold.\n\nApollo\u2019s movements were smooth, and the robot even hammed it up for the camera as I snapped some photos. It should be noted, however, that this was an extremely limited pick-and-place demo that exists for demonstration purposes only. This was not the intelligent, autonomous version of the robot set to be deployed in factories.",

The transaction requires approval from the Indian central bank.\n\nThe Bengaluru-headquartered startup, formerly known as Capital Float, has so far raised $135 million from investors including Peak XV Partners, Ribbit Capital, and Elevation Capital over the years.\n\nAxio specializes in providing credit to self-employed individuals and households at the point of sale on major e-commerce platforms, including Amazon and MakeMyTrip. It claims it serves more than 10 million customers and that its loan book is worth more than $260 million.\n\nAxio and other startups like it in India operate in a market where access to traditional credit remains limited \u2014 the country has low credit card penetration, and conventional banks often find small-ticket loans unprofitable.\n\nThe startup says it attempts to address this gap with its regulated lending platform that can assess customers\u2019 credit-worthiness rapidly, helping it make credit decisions \u201cwithin two clicks and five seconds.\u201d\n\nBut like many other startups in the category, Axio has also struggled to maintain its growth. Goldman Sachs-backed ZestMoney, which operated in a similar space and was once valued at $450 million, also struggled and was eventually bought by financial services firm DMI Group in a fire sale last year.\n\nThe startup competes with Bajaj Finance, the Indian financial services giant that dominates the market.",

    "raw_text": "French startup Swan has raised another \u20ac42 million (around $44 million at current exchange rates). The company considers this round as the second part of the Series B that was originally announced in September 2023.\n\nSwan helps other companies offer financial products at scale. The company can generate both virtual and physical cards that work with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Cards can be configured programmatically by Swan\u2019s corporate clients with spending limits, authorized merchants, and more.\n\nIt can also create payment accounts with an individual IBAN. This way, accounts support pay-ins, pay-outs, and even SEPA direct debits. These accounts can be used as the source of money for the payment cards.\n\nSeveral fast-growing companies have chosen Swan as their embedded banking partner. For instance, Pennylane, a French accounting startup that became a unicorn last year, now offers accounts and payment cards to its customers and relies on Swan for those features.\n\nSimilarly, Indy, an all-in-one administrative assistant for freelancers, turned to Swan to add accounts and cards to its offerings. Other customers include Agicap, Factorial, Lucca, and Sesame.\n\nOverall, Swan works with 150 companies and processes \u20ac1.5 billion in monthly transactions.\n\nEight Roads Ventures is leading the second tranche with existing investors Lakestar, Accel, Creandum, Hexa, and Bpifrance participating again; Bpifrance originally invested in Swan\u2019s seed round through its Digital Venture fund.\n\n\u201cWe believe the embedded finance opportunity is immense, and that banking services will increasingly be offered directly where users are, within existing software and workflows. We\u2019ve known Nicolas and his team since their early days and have been consistently impressed by their rapid progress, Tier 1 customer base, and successful international expansion,\u201d Eight Roads Ventures partner Lucile Cornet said in a statement.\n\nWhile the company isn\u2019t disclosing its valuation, Swan\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Nicolas Benady, told TechCrunch that it\u2019s higher than it used to be. \u201cWe\u2019re not a unicorn yet, so we don\u2019t mention it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile many fintech startups are building products on top of other fintech APIs and products, Swan has built its own core banking system. That\u2019s why it can offer local IBANs and add country-specific payment products.\n\nAs for Swan\u2019s customers, having the option to handle money without handling money directly is an interesting opportunity. Swan handles compliance and KYC (know your customer) obligations. With Thursday\u2019s funding round, Swan will continue to expand to more countries, with Italy being next on the roadmap.",

    "raw_text": "Tesla has announced that its redesigned Model Y SUV is coming to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in March, with a starting price just shy of $60,000.\n\nThe news comes just two weeks after Tesla revealed the new-look Model Y and said the SUV was coming to China and other Asian markets, also in March. Thursday\u2019s announcement means the company is effectively launching the revamped SUV simultaneously around the globe \u2014 a departure from the multiple-month gap between the Asian and North American launch of the Model 3 sedan refresh in late 2023 and early 2024.\n\nThe redesigned Model Y is being launched at a crucial time for Tesla, which delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than it did in 2023. Tesla has repeatedly warned investors that it is in between \u201ctwo major growth waves\u201d coming off the success of the Model Y and promised that it will roll out mysterious new models meant to be built on existing production lines. Those models will likely be cheaper than Tesla\u2019s current offerings (which start in the low $40,000 range), but it\u2019s not clear by how much.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has implied those new models, plus the Cybercab that was teased last October, will help bridge the company\u2019s evolution from an automaker into a robotics and AI player.\n\nBut at the same time, Tesla\u2019s vehicle lineup has been aging. Tesla has now refreshed each of its core vehicles \u2014 the Model S and 3 sedans and the Model X and Y SUVs. It has only launched one truly new model in the last four years, the Cybertruck. While it became the best-selling electric truck in the U.S. in 2024, the Cybertruck did little to boost the company\u2019s bottom line last year, and it does not seem to be the runaway hit Musk had hoped for.\n\nThe new-look Model Y could offer some relief, although it is coming in at a higher price point than the existing versions. The starting price for the \u201cLaunch Series\u201d special edition, which is an all-wheel-drive variant, is $59,990. That gets buyers a 320-mile range battery and it includes Tesla\u2019s most advanced driver-assistance software, which it calls \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised)\u201d \u2014 typically an $8,000 option. The older Model Y currently starts at $44,990 for a 337-mile rear-wheel drive version.\n\nThe most noticeable changes to the new Model Y come on the exterior, where the bubbly front fascia has been ditched in favor of a more cinched nose with a thin light bar that stretches across the hood. The rear of the vehicle also now has a light strip that stretches the full width.\n\nInside the refreshed SUV, Tesla has added a configurable light strip that rims the cabin. There\u2019s a new rear-passenger touchscreen and some quality-of-life upgrades like powered rear seats and improved suspension.",

(He also happens to be a judge on the French version of \u201cShark Tank.\u201d) \u201cA hardware problem has put an end to the adventure, despite all our efforts and the incredible work of all our employees.\u201d\n\nOriginally founded in 2019, Angell set out to create an electric bike with several smart and connected features. Its original bike packed a small color touch screen in the middle of the handlebar to display relevant information and give turn-by-turn directions. It could also connect to your phone using Bluetooth.\n\nWith its integrated lock and alarm system and its built-in GPS chip and cellular modem, the Angell bike competed with other European smart bike manufacturers, such as Cowboy and VanMoof. It\u2019s also worth noting that VanMoof itself had to file for bankruptcy in the Netherlands in 2023. A new owner is now trying to relaunch the brand.\n\nWith its all-in-one package, Angell suffered from reliability issues. In an email to customers, the company explained that its latest issue with its first-generation bike was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cThe fragility of the bike\u2019s frame represents a risk of breakage,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe understand that it is a defect connected to the manufacturing process of the frames, and more precisely to the welding of the tubes together.\u201d\n\nAngell doesn\u2019t manufacture its own bikes. Instead, it has partnered with SEB, the French industrial company behind All-Clad, Krups, Moulinex, Rowenta, and Tefal, to outsource the manufacturing process. Similarly, it has worked with a third-party design company, Kickmaker.\n\nIn the rest of the email, Angell attempts to shift the blame to these two partners for these severe design flaws. Nevertheless, Angell is financially responsible for these faulty bikes, as it is the company that sold those bikes. It could either recall up to 7,000 bikes or reimburse its customers.\n\nBut those two options seem too costly for the startup as the company has opted for an insolvency process. There will likely be other cases to determine who is responsible for those manufacturing issues between Angell, SEB, and Kickmaker.\n\nAs for Angell bike owners, people who own the first-generation bikes are now left with a bike that isn\u2019t safe to ride. Customers with recent Angell bikes will also be affected as the company says it may turn off its servers at some point. Let\u2019s hope that it isn\u2019t going to affect the electric assistance and smart lock.",

    "raw_text": "Oil and gas isn\u2019t the only source of energy lurking under our feet. Drill deep enough and Earth\u2019s temperature stays consistent enough that it can be a source of heating and cooling for homes, offices, and data centers.\n\nBut in many regions, geothermal wells today bottom out at around 500 feet, a limitation that is largely dictated by the sort of drilling equipment that\u2019s typically used.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty shallow, and you\u2019re going to need two or three times the amount of space if you only go to those depths,\u201d Joselyn Lai, co-founder and CEO of Bedrock Energy, told TechCrunch.\n\nTo minimize geothermal\u2019s footprint, Bedrock drills deeper.\n\n\u201cIn a cooling-dominant location, that can very well be 800 to 1,000 feet, which is three times more space efficient. And in a heating-dominant location, that can very well be 1,000 to 1,200 feet or even more, which is two times more space efficient,\u201d Lai said.\n\nBecause it doesn\u2019t need as much land, Bedrock has been targeting commercial buildings where land tends to be at a premium. It completed its first two installations last year, one at an office building in Austin, Texas, and another at a resort in Utah. For installations like these, Lai said that the company expects to be profitable on a project basis in the next year.\n\nBedrock has also started to explore applying geothermal cooling to data centers. Last fall, the startup partnered with Dominion Energy to study the space.\n\nOne of the main challenges is that data centers are one-way users of geothermal energy. Since servers generate heat 24/7, data centers would be dumping heat into the ground year-round. Contrast that with other users like office buildings, which tend to cool in the summer and heat in the winter, leading to a more balanced annual energy budget.\n\nStill, it\u2019s looking promising, Lai said. What\u2019s underground can make a difference: Fast-flowing ground water, for example, can cool things off more quickly. The boreholes would need to be spread out compared with other installations, raising overall costs. But Bedrock\u2019s data analysis, developed with experience gleaned from the oil and gas sector, suggests that geothermal would be a good fit for data centers, especially when paired with solar farms, which also need large tracts of land.\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking, cooling with geothermal is about twice as efficient as cooling with water and air, especially at the hottest times of the day when it\u2019s very, very humid, which is what happens in a lot of states that have data centers,\u201d Lai said.\n\nGeothermal\u2019s other benefit is how consistently it uses electricity. Because Earth\u2019s temperature is relatively stable, the heat pumps that transfer energy to or from a geothermal reservoir don\u2019t have to ramp up or down to compensate for changes in air temperature, as air-source heat pumps do. For large electricity users like office buildings and data centers, that can be a boon to the bottom line since utilities typically charge heavy users more when their demand spikes.\n\nLai said that the outlook for geothermal remains promising enough that the company continues to invest in expanding operations and research and development, focusing on automation to speed installations. To support that growth, Bedrock recently raised a $12 million Series A led by Titanium Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, and Sustainable Future Ventures with participation from Cantos, Elemental Capital, First Star Ventures, Overture Ventures, Toba Capital, and Wireframe Ventures.",

    "raw_text": "Chinese AI company DeepSeek has been accused of IP theft, faced privacy inquiries in Europe, and has been the target of an enormous cyberattack. Now, it appears the company has a new headache on its hands: a U.S. trademark conflict.\n\nOn Tuesday, DeepSeek filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) seeking to trademark its AI chatbot apps, products, and tools. But it was a hair too late. Thirty-six hours earlier, another firm had filed for the trademark \u201cDeepSeek\u201d: a Delaware-based company going by the name \u201cDelson Group Inc.\u201d\n\nDelson Group asserts that it has been selling DeepSeek-branded AI products since early 2020. In its application, the company lists its address as a home in Cupertino, and its CEO and founder as a person named Willie Lu.\n\nLu, who coincidentally graduated from the same university as DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, Zhejiang University, claims on his LinkedIn profile to be a \u201csemi-retired\u201d consulting professor at Stanford and an FCC advisor. Lu seems to have spent most of his career in the wireless industry. Other web pages TechCrunch uncovered through the email address listed in the trademark filing mention Lu\u2019s lectures and training courses on wireless standards.\n\nLu also hosts a \u201cDeepSeek\u201d educational course in Las Vegas on \u201cAI Super-Intelligence,\u201d starting at $800 a ticket \u2014 which features prominently on the website linked in Delson Group\u2019s trademark filing. The website claims that Lu has \u201cabout 30 years\u2019 expertise in ICT [information and communications technology] and AI fields.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment at the trademark filing email, Lu told TechCrunch that he would be willing to \u201cmeet and talk\u201d in Palo Alto or Saratoga. (This reporter is based in NYC.) Lu didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up request.\n\nA search for \u201cDelson Group\u201d in the USPTO\u2019s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Inquiry System turns up more than two dozen disputes between Lu and organizations, including the GSMA, Tencent, and TracFone Wireless. Delson has abandoned some of the trademarks it filed for, or otherwise canceled its pending applications.\n\nA broader search using the USPTO\u2019s Trademark Search tool yields a list of 28 trademarks registered under Delson, a few of which are brands belonging to major Chinese companies. Delson has a trademark for \u201cGeely,\u201d for example, the Chinese automotive firm, and \u201cChina Mobile,\u201d the Hong Kong-based telecommunications provider.\n\nThe pattern suggests a history of trademark squatting \u2014 registering a trademark with the intention of selling it later or riding on a brand\u2019s popularity. In one of the best-known examples of trademark squatting, Chinese businessman Zhan Baosheng successfully trademarked the English name \u201cTesla\u201d in China, as well as Tesla\u2019s \u201cT\u201d logo, font, and Chinese transliterated name. (Baosheng later settled with Tesla for an undisclosed amount.)\n\nBe that as it may, DeepSeek\u2019s options are quite limited at this juncture. Under U.S. law, the very first user of a trademark is typically considered that trademark\u2019s rightful owner, unless it can be proven that the trademark was registered in bad faith.\n\n\u201cWhile DeepSeek could potentially seek a coexistence agreement if they can prove they operate in different aspects of AI than Delson Group, the U.S. company has several advantages,\u201d Josh Gerben, an attorney and the founder of Gerben IP, a law practice specializing in IP issues, told TechCrunch. \u201cThey filed first, they claim earlier use \u2014 2020 versus DeepSeek\u2019s claimed 2023 start date \u2014 [and] they have a live website showing AI-related activities, including training events.\u201d\n\nGerben said that Delson Group might even be able to claim \u201creverse confusion\u201d due to DeepSeek\u2019s rapid rise to prominence, or sue to block DeepSeek from continuing to use its brand name in the U.S.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek may actually have a trademark problem in the United States where there could be this prior rights holder \u2014 Delson Group \u2014 and that prior rights holder may have a very good case for trademark infringement,\u201d Gerben said.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time an AI company has run up against trademark headwinds.",

    "raw_text": "The newest generation of startups aiming to solve cross-border payments are focusing on stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrency coins often pegged to actual currencies or other commodities to help them keep stable prices \u2014 to build solutions that work faster and often cheaper than classic financial rails. This trend is also driving a surge in investor interest in fintech.\n\nThe latest development is Cedar Money, a U.S.-based startup that recently closed $9.9 million in seed funding led by global fintech investor QED Investors with participation from Lattice, NIV, Stellar, and Wischoff Ventures.\n\nLike many cross-border payment platforms using stablecoins, Cedar Money acts as a bridge. Businesses and individuals transact using a fiat-based site, while stablecoin transactions run in the background. Cedar Money plans to scale its payment infrastructure and tackle the inefficiencies in international payments with this funding, it said.\n\nThese inefficiencies are particularly painful in Africa, where businesses face higher transaction fees and hidden costs in currency conversions because of added risk and the costs of working with local banking. Banks profit from exchange rate spreads, adding another layer of expense. \u201cIf you look at the SWIFT network, fees globally are around 2-3%, but in Africa, they\u2019re much higher. It\u2019s even more gouging in places where people have less money,\u201d founder and CEO Benjy Feinberg told TechCrunch.\n\nFeinberg founded Cedar Money in 2022 after nearly a decade leading alternative financing provider Behalf. Before launching his latest venture, he spent time identifying the next \u201cbig\u201d opportunity in fintech, ultimately focusing on payments and blockchain.\n\nWhile stablecoins have struggled to gain traction in the U.S. due to limited use cases and competition with traditional systems like the dollar and SWIFT, Feinberg recognized a different reality in emerging markets.\n\nBusinesses across Africa, the Middle East, and South America need dollars to pay for imports, even when buying from countries like China. In countries like Nigeria or Argentina, getting dollars can be a struggle due to weak local currencies like the naira or the Argentine peso.\n\nCedar Money launched in early 2024, starting operations in Nigeria, helping businesses in the country accept and send money to others globally. \u201cYou want to go to a place where you can solve a big problem, and the adoption will be easier. That\u2019s why we started in Africa \u2014 because the need is greatest here,\u201d the chief executive said.\n\nHowever, despite their popularity, stablecoin platforms face limitations that may affect their scale across markets.\n\nFeinberg, when asked, explained that while building the payment rails \u2014 converting fiat to stablecoins, transferring them, and converting back \u2014 is challenging, it\u2019s not exactly groundbreaking. According to him, the real difficulty and where Cedar Money is trying to excel lies in building the compliance rails to accommodate every country\u2019s unique regulatory requirements and banks\u2019 extensive documentation to ensure legitimate transactions.\n\nThese requirements are particularly tricky in markets like Africa, where infrastructure differences make seemingly simple demands \u2014 like providing a street address \u2014 much more challenging.\n\nFeinberg argued that the winners in this space will be those who can scale their operations globally while navigating complex compliance requirements, especially in underserved regions.\n\n\u201cI would say the biggest challenge is to educate the banks in the developed world that the funds they\u2019re getting from the underdeveloped world are good. It\u2019s a challenge, but we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nYet, the U.S. is setting the tone for favorable regulatory sentiment toward digital assets that could ease compliance. Many stakeholders in the industry believe this event, coupled with others like Stripe\u2019s acquisition of stablecoin startup Bridge, will not only cause a broader acceptance of stablecoin payments but also make banks and regulators globally and in emerging markets relax their strong views on stablecoin adoption.\n\nThat adoption is beginning to reshape the global payments landscape. Data from a16z and other sources illustrate this clearly: In 2017, stablecoin transaction volumes were negligible compared to traditional systems. Fast-forward to today, and stablecoins have surpassed Mastercard, PayPal, and Visa. In Q2 2024, stablecoin transactions reached $8.5 trillion across 1 billion transactions compared to $3.9 trillion in volume across 50x more transactions, according to an a16z report.\n\nCedar Money, founded a year ago, processes tens of millions in monthly transaction volume by focusing on import and export businesses handling tangible goods such as rice and shoes, supported by bona fide invoices, an approach that simplifies underwriting for banks since transactions involve clear documentation and physical commodities, according to Feinberg, who declined to share client numbers.\n\nQED Investors partner Gbenga Ajayi, citing why the global fintech firm invested in Cedar Money, says the fintech is \u201cuniquely positioned to tackle the inefficiencies of the global financial system.\u201d\n\nThe payments company, which has 14 staff across Nigeria, the U.S., Israel, and Serbia, is QED Investors\u2019 fourth Africa-focused investment after Moniepoint, Precium, and Remedial Health.\n\nCedar Money joins a growing list of players like Conduit and Caliza, which serve businesses in emerging markets with stablecoin-powered payments. However, despite growing relevance, reaching a $205 billion market cap last year, Feinberg says their collective share of the international payments remains small, so Cedar Money has no direct competition at this stage.\n\n\u201cToday, two-thirds of international payments are through the correspondent banking network. The size of the biggest fiat innovators is probably 2-5% of the market. So if you\u2019re looking at this and you\u2019re saying, well, two-thirds are the banks, 5% are the fiat innovators, and 0.01% are the stablecoins guys. Then your competition, or your way forward, is not to compete necessarily with other players; it\u2019s just to find your little corner because the market\u2019s just so big.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "At a recent investor meeting, early-stage African investor Oui Capital informed limited partners that it had returned its $4 million debut fund following the sale of some shares in the business banking platform Moniepoint.\n\nThe African fintech unicorn has so far proven to be a standout investment for five-year-old Oui Capital. When it launched its first fund, it invested $150,000 in the Nigeria-based company, an early bet that has since generated an $8 million return \u2014 enough to pay back the fund.\n\nSpecifically, last October, when Moniepoint raised $110 million in funding at a $1 billion valuation in a Series C round led by Development Partners International, Oui Capital sold some of its shares into the deal; now, with its fund repaid, any future returns will be pure profit for its investors.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare feat for a young VC firm \u2014 many globally fail to return their first fund \u2014 and even rarer in Africa\u2019s venture ecosystem. Still, it underscores how lucrative some early-stage bets, especially in fintech, can be on the continent. Oui Capital joins other pan-African investors like CRE VC and 4DX Ventures that have returned their first funds after backing other unicorns, such as Andela and Flutterwave, according to two people familiar with investor dealings on the continent.\n\nTechCrunch contacted Oui Capital for comment, and the firm confirmed the news.\n\nMoniepoint, previously known as TeamApt, wasn\u2019t a household name in 2019 when Oui Capital first considered it. At the time, the company primarily built financial products and software for itself and banks.\n\nOui Capital, founded by Olu Oyinsan and Francesco Andreoli, was among its earliest investors and also one of the few to support the outfit\u2019s pivot to Moniepoint, a business banking and payments platform that has since become Nigeria\u2019s largest merchant acquirer.\n\n\u201cThey have been with us through the stages, from seeking product-market fit to getting to production,\u201d Tosin Eniolorunda, Moniepoint co-founder and CEO, said of Oui Capital in a 2021 video. \u201cOlu [managing partner at Oui Capital] has been helpful in advisory; we talk through strategy, governance, and key matters that affect the company. They have also been helpful in our investment campaigns, from introducing potential investors to sometimes just thinking around our narrative and positioning\u2026\u201d\n\nExits in Africa\u2019s tech scene remain rare, with only 143 out of 2,971 venture deals since 2019 leading to exits, according to The Big Deal. Most startups are still in their early or growth stages \u2014 far from the maturity needed for significant exits. Unlike developed markets with robust M&A and IPO options, Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem is still growing, leaving fewer startups in an exit-ready position.\n\nOn the other hand, venture investments typically take five-10 years to mature, so many African-focused VC firms still await returns. For Oui Capital, that wait took five years. When the firm joined Moniepoint\u2019s seed round, the company was valued at a $12.5 million, as revealed in an investor report seen by TechCrunch.\n\nAnecdotally, smaller funds are easier to return due to their size. Data from Cambridge Associates, which builds and manages investment portfolios for institutional investors, bucks up this trend.\n\nBut more importantly, Oyinsan credits his fund\u2019s portfolio construction for the firm\u2019s traction to date. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about fund size \u2014 it\u2019s about what you invest in, your entry price, how much equity you own, how much you invest, and when you decide to exit,\u201d he tells TechCrunch.\n\nOther startups in Oui Capital\u2019s portfolio include Duplo, which digitizes payment flows for African B2B enterprises; Maad, a B2B e-commerce platform for fast-moving consumer goods; and Matta, a B2B marketplace for chemicals, from its first fund, Mentors Fund 1.\n\nThe investor, with 22 startups across two funds, writes checks of up to $400,000 for seed-stage startups across Africa.",

    "raw_text": "DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, became the talk of the proverbial AI town when it released its R1 model on Friday. R1\u2019s functionality and accuracy compared to its U.S. counterparts, despite using fewer resources and less compute power, seems like a win for the overall AI industry. But it isn\u2019t necessarily good news for everyone.\n\nSemiconductor giant Nvidia finds itself in the headwinds of DeepSeek\u2019s recent achievement. The chip giant saw its stock plummet 16.9% from the close of Friday\u2019s public markets to the close of public markets on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance data. Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion off of its market cap. Nvidia\u2019s stock closed at $142.62 a share on Friday afternoon. On Monday, it closed at $118.58.\n\nThere is speculation that the reason why DeepSeek\u2019s model release would impact Nvidia\u2019s stock is that R1 provides a clear example that AI models don\u2019t necessarily need expensive, high-end chips or hardware to build an impressive model, which isn\u2019t exactly great news for a chipmaker like Nvidia.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,\u201d an Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch over email. \u201cDeepSeek\u2019s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\u201d\n\nThe timing of all of this is interesting because this comes one week after former president Joe Biden signed an executive order that made further restrictions on the export of U.S.-produced advanced AI chips to certain countries, with near-blanket restrictions on sending chips to countries like China, where DeepSeek is based.\n\nAt the time, Nvidia said that the executive order was \u201cunprecedented and misguided\u201d and that it would \u201cderail\u201d innovation and economic growth worldwide.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has since reversed Biden\u2019s executive order and has signed a different executive order to create the Stargate Project, an infrastructure program that will invest up to $500 billion into AI data centers.\n\nThe release of DeepSeek shows that if the U.S. wants dominance over the global AI market, it may need to pay attention to more than just chips and AI hardware.",

    "raw_text": "Since it was founded in 2014, India-based Postman has made a name for itself as one of the most popular platforms for building and using APIs, with 500,000 organizations now using the service. Like with so many other SaaS services, though, its valuation today is reportedly down from its $5.6 billion high in 2021. But the company is now jumping head-first into the AI space with the launch of an AI agent builder that combines large language models and the Postman API platform, as well as a visual editor that brings the two together to help even non-developers build and test AI agents.\n\nAt first, jumping into AI agents may seem like an odd choice for a company like Postman, but as Postman CEO and co-founder Abhinav Asthana noted when I talked to him ahead of the agent builder\u2019s launch, to be useful, these agents have to interact with a wide variety of services \u2014 and the way to do that is through APIs.\n\n\u201cOur customers actually started asking us about this. \u2018Okay, this agent thing is kind of coming up. What are you guys doing about it?\u2019 And we looked at the patterns in which they are stringing this together. Whether they\u2019re using homegrown systems or they\u2019re using some third-party stuff, APIs are a key part of it, because there are two kinds of APIs: one is the LLM itself, like the OpenAI API, or the Anthropic\u2019s API, or maybe a homegrown API. And the second bit are tools the agent would use. So we were like, okay, Postman is helping developers do all things APIs and if this is emerging as a pattern, we should do something here,\u201d explained Asthana.\n\nHe also noted that a growing number of Postman users are non-developers, who want to use the service for building simple, API-centric applications. \u201cSo when AI technology started emerging, we had to test it out a lot. We saw like, \u2018okay, can this be used?\u2019 And it looks like no-code, plus AI, plus agents is a good combo to bring together,\u201d Asthana said.\n\nPostman\u2019s API network already features an API hub with contributions from over 18,000 companies, which now, in turn, also allows its users to build AI agents that can interact with these APIs. To ensure that these agents work as expected, Postman is adding testing and evaluation tools to the service to test prompts and inputs for the models it supports (think OpenAI, Google\u2019s Gemini, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, Cohere, and Meta\u2019s Llama, for example). It then allows users to use Postman Flows, the company\u2019s visual development environment, to build these agents and have them interact with APIs.\n\nRight now, Postman\u2019s AI agents are mostly focused on enabling back-end operations. While developers could use the service to power front-end services, Postman itself doesn\u2019t offer any user interface for directly interacting with these agents yet. Over time, this may change. \u201cWe are all very bullish on agent software, but I think the modalities in which we interact with these systems is also going to evolve,\u201d Asthana said.\n\nPostman, of course, is not the only company in this space, but on top of having its existing API hub, Asthana also believes that it can differentiate its service from others \u2014 and especially the large cloud providers \u2014 by offering a better developer experience. \u201cIn my opinion, the cloud providers always prioritize consumption of the cloud over developer experience, and I think they\u2019re willing to partner with anyone who does actually give the right developer experience,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company is still figuring out how to best charge for this new service. Pricing, Asthana said, will evolve over time as the team works out how to best determine the value that these agents bring.",

    "raw_text": "The data center market is booming, driven by AI demand. Just last week, OpenAI said that it plans to team up with backers including SoftBank to spend at least $100 billion on data center infrastructure in the U.S. Microsoft aims to put around $80 billion toward AI infrastructure this year, and rival tech giants have also upped their footprints.\n\nFirms like DataBank, which provide high-performance compute-ready data centers for enterprise clients, are the big winners in the race for more compute. Case in point: DataBank on Thursday announced that it raised $250 million in an investment from private equity firm TJC and an additional $600 million in a secondary share offer.\n\nRaul K. Martynek, DataBank\u2019s CEO, said in a press release that the new capital \u201csignals both confidence in our strategy and our proven ability to execute and scale.\u201d\n\nDataBank, founded in 2005, was acquired in 2016 by a group of blue-chip investors led by DigitalBridge, an asset manager, and merged with several other data center operators. The company has expanded through acquisitions over the years, in 2018 acquiring Indianapolis-based data center provider Lightbound and in 2020 purchasing zColo\u2019s U.S. and U.K. data center assets.\n\nDataBank claims to manage over 65 data centers across more than 27 markets. In the past year and a half alone, the firm has raised $5 billion.\n\n\u201cWe could not be more excited to partner with Raul, DataBank, and the other world-class digital infrastructure investors supporting DataBank\u2019s robust growth plans,\u201d Eion Hu, a partner at TJC, said in a statement. \u201cData centers are the cornerstone of the digital transformation and artificial intelligence, and we believe DataBank is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the sustained demand for reliable, scalable, and energy-efficient infrastructure in an increasingly data-driven world.\u201d\n\nIn a sector adjacent to DataBank, there\u2019s a booming market for \u201cneocloud\u201d startups like Crusoe and others building low-cost, on-demand clouds primarily for AI workloads.\n\nCoreWeave, the GPU infrastructure provider with several Big Tech partnerships, is valued at $19 billion. Lambda Labs last April secured a special-purpose financing vehicle up to $500 million. The nonprofit Voltage Park in October 2023 announced it is investing $500 million in GPU-backed data centers.

Past cohort members include Paul Copplestone, co-founder of developer platform Supabase; Jordan Tigani, co-founder of analytics company MotherDuck; and software engineer Wes McKinney, who created the Python pandas project. Applications for the third cohort opens this week.\n\nZeller described Powerset as a sort of decentralized venture fund: There\u2019s no programming to \u201cteach\u201d founders how to invest, no timeline for when founders need to deploy the capital, and no group of managing partners that can veto a deal. Founders take home 15% of whatever profit a deal makes.\n\nIt\u2019s an experimental model that rests somewhere between angel investing \u2014 except founders are not investing their own personal money \u2014 and the old-school VC scout programs, where VCs engaged people, including founders, to help them source deals. The cohort founders are then encouraged to mentor and advise the portfolio companies, like any investor.\n\nIn Powerset\u2019s case, however, investments are made entirely at the whims of already overworked and stressed-out founders. \u201cThere are some founders who are so busy with their companies and so picky that they don\u2019t invest at all,\u201d Zeller said. Or a founder will go from making no investments \u201cto being one of the most active very quickly.\u201d\n\nDespite complications, Zeller believes Powerset\u2019s strategy will produce massive returns. \u201cOftentimes it\u2019s the best founders who are building the best companies and are going to make for the best investors,\u201d he said.\n\nFounders, after all, deeply understand the intricacies of building a startup in their field and are constantly on the lookout for top talent anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve never found a genius-level technical founder who\u2019s building an incredible company who just sucks at investment,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s no hard and fast rules for who qualifies for Powerset\u2019s program \u2014 just that you are building a company and immersed in the tech ecosystem. \u201cHopefully your company is getting to a scale where you kind of get some organic connectivity,\u201d Zeller said, meaning that other founders like your product and are naturally reaching out to you.\n\nBut Zeller does have one deal breaker: He\u2019s not interested in anyone who views Powerset as an off-ramp to running a company, with aspirations to imminently become a full-time venture capitalist. \u201cThose people are going to perform terribly,\u201d he said.\n\nHe claims the best-performing Powerset participants are founders who plan to spend the next five, 10 years building their own company. \u201cIf you\u2019re building something that\u2019s hugely important, and your life mission and your life work, you\u2019re not going to invest in some marginal company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the activation energy.\u201d",

Summer Nuclear Power Station, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nVirgil C. Summer Nuclear Power Station is a single reactor power plant. Santee Cooper was spearheading the construction of two new reactors, an expansion that began in 2008. The unfinished project was halted in 2017 after an audit revealed the project cost had ballooned from $9.8 billion to $25 billion and that completion would take far longer than expected, causing it to miss $2 billion in federal incentives.\n\nThe boondoggle contributed to the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, the nuclear power company descended from one of the earliest electric companies in the United States. It also led to securities fraud convictions for two executives at SCANA, Santee Cooper\u2019s partner in the project.\n\nThe two reactors that were under construction are sisters of a pair installed at the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia. The Vogtle expansion was finally commissioned in 2023 after years of delays and billions in overruns, casting a pall over the entire U.S. nuclear power industry.\n\nDespite the troubled history at V.C. Summer, Santee Cooper is optimistic that it\u2019ll find buyers as nuclear power experiences a resurgence of interest fueled by skyrocketing power demand from AI data centers.\n\nThe utility has some tailwinds: Microsoft recently inked a deal with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island, and Meta is looking for developers to propose 1 to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity. Santee Cooper is reportedly hoping to sell to a consortium that would include a tech company interested in securing power.\n\nAny deal Santee puts together will still face some potentially thorny politics. A portion of the costs for the V.C. Summer expansion was foisted onto ratepayers as a result of a state law that allowed utilities to offload the cost of new nuclear reactors. Completing the expansion and finding a buyer for the power could help relieve the burden. Since it\u2019s a state-owned utility, politicians will undoubtedly take an interest in any deal, for better or worse.",

    "raw_text": "Companies that want to build AI voice into their products are rushing to work with ElevenLabs, the startup that develops synthetic voice technology like voice cloning and dubbing tools. Now ElevenLabs is turning up the volume on its business with a huge Series C raise, just a year after a sizable Series B.\n\nThe New York startup has closed a Series C of $250 million at a valuation between $3 billion and $3.3 billion, multiple sources tell TechCrunch. The round is being led by ICONIQ Growth, several people said. Andreessen Horowitz, one of the lead investors in the company\u2019s $80 million Series B in January 2024, was another name mentioned as a potential investor in this round. ElevenLabs, ICONIQ Growth, and Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nFor months, investors have been scrambling to invest in ElevenLabs after a blockbuster period of growth for the company, with its AI audio technology getting used everywhere, TechCrunch was the first to report in October.\n\nOn the back of a strong funnel of business, sources tell us that ElevenLabs was initially looking for funding at a $4 billion valuation. But a $3 billion valuation is still triple the unicorn valuation that the company landed with that year-ago Series B. One source said the company has been preparing to announce the round this month so official confirmation may come any day now.\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 fundraise comes after a strong few years both for the company and the wider industry. The company was founded in 2022 by Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dabkowski, who respectively previously worked at Palantir and Google. Childhood friends from Poland, the pair were inspired by the poor quality of dubbing in the American videos they watched growing up, and they saw an opportunity to use AI to develop something better.\n\nTheir idea was a clear example of right idea, right time. As generative AI services have become more advanced, multimedia has come to the fore, and there has been a growing interest in building applications that include sound and video alongside GenAI text services.\n\nElevenLabs released its first beta product in January 2023, and by the time it had raised its Series A of $19 million in June 2023, it had gone viral.\n\nSome of that growth has not been without controversy, with stories of fake news being created with its tech. But as ElevenLabs has developed a raft of detection tools and other safeguards to prevent misuse, it has emerged as a key partner for enabling speech-based services for an increasingly high-profile number of businesses.\n\nIts technology, usable via an API and priced at a number of usage tiers, covers a wide range of use cases: translating text to speech (in multiple languages), cloning voices, changing voices in an audio track, creating entirely new voices, alongside other voice editing tools.\n\nCustomers include other technology platforms such as Syntheisa, the text-to-video startup that works with businesses and that announced a fundraise of $180 million earlier this month; publishing giants like Washington Post, HarperCollins, and Bertelsmann, which says 36 businesses are using ElevenLabs\u2019 tech in their content creation; and gaming companies, among others.\n\nUsage has led to a rapid rise in sales. In October, sources told us that ElevenLabs\u2019 annualized recurring revenue (ARR; this is commonly calculated by multiplying the latest monthly revenue by 12) had grown from $25 million in 2023 to $80 million. Two people in November estimated that its ARR was likely closer to $90 million. If the latter figure is accurate, a $4 billion valuation would have put its valuation multiple at 44 times ARR; in the end it seems the deal has been done at a slightly more moderate multiple of 37 times ARR.\n\nFor some context on that number, these are not the most exuberant valuations at the moment: Investors appear willing to pay as much as 50 times ARR for the fastest-growing generative AI companies.\n\nAnysphere, the maker of the popular AI-coding assistant Cursor, has received multiple unsolicited offers valuing the company at about $2.5 billion, which translates to about 52 times ARR, TechCrunch reported in November. The company has seen its revenue grow from $4 million ARR in April to $4 million a month as of last month. However, by the time the deal, which was led by Thrive at a valuation of $2.5 billion, was announced earlier this month, Anysphere had reached $100 million in ARR, The New York Times reported. That implies that the company was valued at 25 times ARR.\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 more temperate multiple may be a function of the company\u2019s competitors, which include a plethora of startups, as well as giants like Google and OpenAI.\n\nOther past backers of the company have included Sequoia, Credo Ventures, Concept Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Disney, and nearly two dozen high-profile angel investors.",

    "raw_text": "Google will rename the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska\u2019s Denali mountain in Google Maps once a federal mapping database reflects changes ordered by the Trump administration, the company announced Monday.\n\nGoogle is complying with an executive order issued last week by President Donald Trump that changed the names of several American landmarks. The executive order was followed by a statement from the U.S. Department of the Interior, which said the name changes were now official and America\u2019s geographic naming bodies were working \u201cexpeditiously\u201d to fulfill Trump\u2019s order.\n\n\u201cWe have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\u201d Google wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico\u2019s name in Google Maps will soon be the \u201cGulf of America\u201d for U.S. users, an entirely new name created by the Trump administration.\n\nDenali, which is North America\u2019s highest peak, will soon show up in Google Maps for all global users as its previous name of Mount McKinley. The Alaskan mountain was named Mount McKinley in 1917 to honor America\u2019s 25th president, William McKinley; the peak was renamed Denali during the Obama administration in 2015. The Trump administration is changing it back, despite protests from some Alaskan senators.\n\nHowever, not everyone in the world using Google Maps will see the Gulf of America.\n\nGeographic names that are contested between different countries show up in Google Maps under each country\u2019s official name for their citizens, according to a social media post from Google. That means the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s name will not change for Mexican users of Google Maps, where the country\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, mocked Trump for suggesting a new name for the body of water. In other countries, Google Maps will display both America\u2019s and Mexico\u2019s names for the gulf side by side.\n\nGoogle says it will make these changes when the official American naming database, the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) is updated. Though the Interior Department announced the Gulf of America and Mount McKinley\u2019s name changes were official on Friday, GNIS still reflects that both are named the Gulf of Mexico and Denali as of Monday evening.",

    "raw_text": "Even just a few years ago, FinOps \u2014 a collection of best practices to manage the costs of cloud computing \u2014 wasn\u2019t something that was top of mind for a lot of businesses. Since then, though, businesses have started tightening their purses. Today, FinOps is pretty much a standard discipline, and there are dozens of startups that aim to help businesses find the right balance between productivity and spend.\n\nOne of the more established companies in this space is Finout, which is announcing a $40 million Series C funding round. That\u2019s on top of a $26 million Series B round the company announced last March (for a total of $85 million to date). While raising two funding rounds in quick succession was a staple of the industry during the boom of 2021, it\u2019s quite unusual to see this today. But as Finout co-founder and CEO Roi Ravhon told me, the company didn\u2019t just take the money and put it in the bank. Instead it capitalized on a unique opportunity, especially after VMware\u2019s Tanzu CloudHealth and Kubecost were acquired by Broadcom and IBM, respectively, in the last two years.\n\n\u201cThe past eight months have been phenomenal for Finout,\u201d he told me when I asked him about how this round came about. \u201cThe market dynamics, with two of our biggest competitors being acquired by Broadcom and IBM, means that most companies don\u2019t have an option. You\u2019re not going to move from Broadcom to IBM. You\u2019re not going to move from IBM to Broadcom. You\u2019re going to the next tier, and this just gives us an amazing and very unique opportunity right now in the market. We are the enterprise-ready tool that can service those businesses. We\u2019re the right tool at the right time, and we\u2019re getting the trust of lots of U.S. enterprise that are in the market to buy new cloud cost management solutions.\u201d\n\nThe Tel Aviv- and New York-based cloud cost management company counts the likes of SiriusXM, Lyft, The New York Times, Choice Hotels, Wiz, Tenable, and Alchemy among its customers.\n\nEarly iterations of cloud cost management, Ravhon said, were built for a world where only AWS existed. Then you start adding in more cloud platforms, Kubernetes, data warehouses, and dozens and dozens of SaaS services. Suddenly the existing offerings start breaking, and it becomes almost impossible for enterprises to figure out where exactly their budgets are being spent.\n\n\u201cWe talked to so many companies that were struggling with the exact same problems as we had, and we understood that we just needed to build the tools that we wanted to use,\u201d Ravhon explained when I asked him how he came to start Finout four years ago. \u201cThe market was ripe for something new, and this is why we decided to start Finout.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the company focuses on three pillars: analytics (to help companies figure out what they are spending on); predictions (because it remains hard for engineering and finance teams to understand how much they will spend in the future); and democratizing FinOps in general, since it\u2019s hard to get engineers to actually care about how much they are spending on cloud resources.\n\nRegarding this third pillar, Ravhon also said that it\u2019s important to note that FinOps is not just about cost cutting. \u201cWe\u2019re a new system of record in those organizations that really helps to drive the conversation around cost management and how it directly correlates to anything that they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nUsing the new funding, Finout plans to double its engineering team in Tel Aviv and expand its go-to-market team, too.\n\nThe new round was led by Insight Partners, with participation from Pitango, Team8, Red Dot Capital, and Maor Investments. The company says its valuation doubled from the Series B round, though it did not disclose its valuation.",

    "raw_text": "Visa has joined African fintech Moniepoint as a new investor. The business banking and payments platform confirmed to TechCrunch that it received a \u201cstrategic investment\u201d from the global payments giant as both companies look to drive financial inclusion and support the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across Africa.\n\nSources close to the deal say the fintech \u2014 which announced a $110 million investment last October, received over $10 million from Visa. The fintech, whose Series C now exceeds $120 million, is reportedly in talks with other investors and may attract more funding in the coming months, all while maintaining its billion-dollar valuation, sources say. Moniepoint declined to comment on the size of Visa\u2019s check or interest from other investors.\n\nMoniepoint provides businesses and individuals with banking accounts, credit, payments, and other financial tools through an app and a network of agents. The fintech now processes over 1 billion transactions monthly, with total payment volumes reaching $22 billion \u2014 a growth of over 25% in under three months. Its rapid rise began during Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank cashless drive in early 2023 and has continued steadily, positioning it as an important player shaping the future of digital payments in the country.\n\nMoniepoint has just a fraction of the total market. Nigeria\u2019s digital payment market spans multiple channels, including electronic transfers, ATMs, POS devices, mobile agents, and web payments. In 2023, businesses and consumers completed transactions worth approximately $400 billion, according to the country\u2019s interbank payments switch. Electronic transfers, powered by the instant payments network NIP \u2014 comparable to India\u2019s UPI and Brazil\u2019s Pix \u2014 dominate the market, accounting for nearly 90% of these transactions, according to data from Stears. Other channels, such as mobile agents, ATMs, and point-of-sale systems, trail far behind.\n\nWhile Moniepoint operates across most of these channels, Visa\u2019s investment highlights the fintech\u2019s position and potential in Nigeria\u2019s card value chain as both a major issuer and acquirer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re present in Nigeria today, leading the chart in merchant acquiring and consumer banking,\u201d CEO Tosin Eniolorunda (pictured above, left, with co-founder Felix Ike) told TechCrunch. \u201cWith Visa as our investor, we can strategically collaborate to continue to grow the payment ecosystem and expand to more countries, which is a key goal for us.\u201d\n\nOne way both companies will look to \u201cgrow the payment ecosystem\u201d is by introducing contactless payments, Eniolorunda said. \u201cThe central bank has indicated the need to drive contactless services to improve accessibility and conduct micro-transactions. So these are some things that we expect from the partnership. It\u2019s progress in the right direction.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s Central Bank showed its latest intent to drive contactless payment adoption with draft guidelines for transaction limits in 2023. However, implementation will depend on clearer regulations and resolving issues related to privacy, security, and trust. Once addressed, contactless payments could significantly boost transaction volumes and arguably outpace other payment methods in the country.\n\nGlobally, Visa notes that contactless card usage surpasses mobile wallets in many markets. Moniepoint is in that sweet spot to lead this transition in Nigeria by offering contactless-enabled payment terminals to businesses and chip cards to individuals, setting the stage for further adoption.\n\nOn the other hand, Moniepoint will leverage Visa\u2019s Cybersource system to gain better visibility into transactions. Additionally, it plans to integrate with Visa Direct for remittances and money transfers as it looks to expand into markets within and outside Africa.\n\nVisa has a history of investing in Africa\u2019s payment infrastructure, backing players like Interswitch, Flutterwave, Paystack, and JUMO over the past decade. With Moniepoint, Visa is making its entry into Nigeria\u2019s SME market, aiming to digitize payments for them and partly in hopes of increasing its share of the country\u2019s card scheme market. Currently, it lags behind Interswitch\u2019s Verve and Mastercard in cards. The latter two have also started making inroads in the tap-to-pay opportunity.\n\n\u201cVisa\u2019s investment in Moniepoint is the latest example of our long-standing commitment to advancing digital economies in Africa,\u201d said Andrew Torre, regional president, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa at Visa. \u201cWe will enable even the smallest businesses to thrive through innovative payment and software solutions that allow SMEs to scale and open new revenue opportunities while streamlining their operations.\u201d",

The round was co-led by RTP Global and LMDV Capital, with participation from Proximity Capital, Primo Capital, as well as other notable investors including the founders of FACEIT, Fiscozen, and Freetrade (the latter through Lumen Ventures). That means it\u2019s now raised \u20ac48 million in total ($49.6 million \u2014 so, \u20ac18 million of equity, \u20ac30 million of credit facility).\n\nFounded in 2023 by entrepreneurs Gianluca Cocco and Gaetano de Maio, Qomodo claims to now serve 2,500 physical merchants, mostly in Italy.\n\nThe idea is that Qomodo lets small businesses improve their cash flow and increase revenue with a BNPL solution which lets consumers make flexible, interest-free installments on items purchased in-store.\n\nThis means retailers are more likely to make sales, while at the same time reducing the credit risk from customers.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Gianluca Cocco, CEO and co-founder of Qomodo, said: \u201cOur software basically simplifies the merchant transaction to help them reduce payment fees and streamline their operation. You can say that we are digitizing SMBs that have been left behind by fintech in the physical world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sort of 360 degrees approach,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have a BNPL and POS solution but we are also going to launch other banking products like cards and bank accounts.\u201d\n\nHe said they are in a space where fintech is not that present, or not at all: \u201cBecause this is about physical merchants. Usually, financial institutions provide personal loans and traditional lending products, or banking products. So those are our actual main competitors.\u201d\n\nLouis Dussart, VP, Europe, RTP Global, commented in a statement: \u201cItaly has been waiting for a B2B fintech champion and that\u2019s why we are delighted to back Qomodo.

A Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch the automaker is working with NHTSA to support its investigation.\n\nThe agency said its initial investigation found BlueCruise has limitations in the \u201cdetection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions.\u201d Those limitations include the potential to falsely detect stationary objects at long distances when the Ford vehicle is traveling at or above 62 miles per hour.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination,\u201d NHTSA said.\n\nFord debuted BlueCruise in 2021 on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models. The hands-free feature uses cameras, radar sensors, and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and speed-sign recognition. BlueCruise and competitor GM\u2019s Super Cruise systems are both hands-free, although an in-cabin camera monitors drivers to ensure their eyes are on the road.\n\nThese systems are considered competitors to Tesla Autopilot, which still requires the driver\u2019s hands to remain on the wheel. Autopilot and the upgraded Tesla Full Self-Driving software are still considered less constrained than Ford BlueCruise, which only works on certain pre-mapped highways.\n\nLast October, NHTSA also opened an investigation into Tesla\u2019s so-called \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised)\u201d software after four reported crashes in low-visibility situations \u2014 including one where a pedestrian was killed. That investigation is ongoing.\n\nThis article was updated to include a comment from Ford.",

    "raw_text": "Talk to many architects, and they\u2019ll likely tell you that Autodesk\u2019s software, including AutoCAD and Revit, has been indispensable to their work for decades.\n\nBut despite their widespread use, Autodesk\u2019s former co-CEO and chief product officer Amar Hanspal says that the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is using 20th century tools to design 21st century buildings. His latest startup, Motif \u2014 a company that Hanspal describes as a \u201cnext-generation design platform for buildings\u201d \u2014 is setting out to change that. It\u2019s now raised $46 million in aid of that effort.\n\nHanspal is coming to the problem on the heels of a long career already in the space of AEC technology. He spent about 20 years at Autodesk, and then in 2018 he co-founded Bright Machines, a manufacturing automation company (which itself has raised significant funding). Six years later, Hanspal left Bright Machines and was looking for his next act.\n\nHis exploration of the AEC industry revealed significant frustration among architects with existing software, which is largely not cloud-based and can take up to 45 minutes to process even simple edits.\n\nIn 2023, Hanspal teamed up with Brian Mathews, former product CTO at Autodesk, to work on Motif.\n\nMotif\u2019s first product won\u2019t be ready until the first half of this year but Hanspal gave a rough picture of what it would be. He said that Motif is working on building a platform that will offer a set of cloud-native 3D computer-aided design tools that will have elements of machine learning and AI.\n\nThe $46 million that the startup has now raised is a combination of seed and Series A funding. The Series A was led by CapitalG, Alphabet\u2019s growth fund, while Redpoint Ventures led the seed round.\n\nCapitalG partner Jill Chase told TechCrunch that she was researching the software for architects before meeting Motif. She noticed that it\u2019s a very large market with outdated products.\n\nShe wondered why existing tools still haven\u2019t been disrupted and learned that putting 3D architecture models in the cloud is technically very difficult.\n\nIn addition to the engineering complexity, selling these tools could be challenging, Chase said. \u201cYou have to have some element of trust and relationships with big architecture firms for them to even let you in the door.\u201d\n\nWhen she met Hanspal and Mathews, she immediately knew that their combined 40 years of experience in the AEC software industry will help them create a company that can take on incumbents.\n\nAs for why it is taking so long to release the first product, Hanspal compared Motif\u2019s effort to design company Figma, which was in stealth mode for three years before releasing anything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big and ambitious venture that we know will take a substantial amount of effort to pull off,\u201d Hanspal said.\n\nMotif is not alone in trying to disrupt AEC software. Other startups in the sector include Snaptrude and Arcol.\n\nBut Hanspal is certain that Motif has the best chance of winning in this market.\n\n\u201cIt really requires a very special team that is willing to do the hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s us.\u201d",

Compared to the performance of the strongest U.S.-produced AI models, Amodei says, DeepSeek\u2019s fall short when factoring in the release time frame.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek produced a model close to the performance of U.S. models 7-10 months older, for a good deal less cost (but not anywhere near the ratios people have suggested),\u201d Amodei said. \u201c[This is] an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve. What\u2019s different this time is that the company that was first to demonstrate the expected cost reductions was Chinese.\u201d\n\nAmodei compares one of DeepSeek\u2019s flagship models, DeepSeek V3, to Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which he says cost a \u201cfew $10M\u2019s\u201d to train. Sonnet\u2019s training finished 9 to 12 months ago, while DeepSeek\u2019s model was trained in November or December \u2014 yet Sonnet remains ahead in a number of \u201cinternal and external evals,\u201d Amodei notes.\n\n\u201cU.S. companies [are also] achieving the usual trend in cost reduction,\u201d Amodei added. \u201cThe efficiency innovations DeepSeek developed will soon be applied by both U.S. and Chinese labs to train multi-billion dollar models.\u201d\n\nAmodei, who in the essay calls DeepSeek \u201cvery talented engineers\u201d that \u201cshow why China is a serious competitor to the U.S.,\u201d foresees a fork in the road depending on which export policies the Trump administration embraces. Before Trump took office, the outgoing Biden administration imposed new restrictions on hardware exports that are scheduled to take effect in the coming months, but that could be curtailed should Trump wish to do so.\n\nIf Trump strengthens export rules and prevents China from obtaining what Amodei describes as \u201cmillions of chips\u201d for AI development, the U.S. and its allies could potentially establish a \u201ccommanding and long-lasting lead,\u201d Amodei claims. If, on the other hand, the U.S. doesn\u2019t make it more challenging for China to import AI chips, the country could \u201cdirect more talent, capital, and focus\u201d to \u201cmilitary applications\u201d of AI technologies, Amodei fears.\n\n\u201cCombined with its large industrial base and military-strategic advantages, this could help China take a commanding lead on the global stage,\u201d Amodei said. \u201cTo be clear, the goal here is not to deny China or any other authoritarian country the immense benefits in science, medicine, quality of life, and so on that come from very powerful AI systems. Everyone should be able to benefit from AI. The goal is to prevent them from gaining military dominance.\u201d\n\nIt seems likely that Amodei will get his preferred outcome. In a Senate hearing on Wednesday, billionaire businessman Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s pick for commerce secretary, accused DeepSeek of stealing American IP.\n\n\u201cWhat this showed is that our export controls, not backed by tariffs, are like a whack-a-mole model,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cChinese tariffs should be the highest.\u201d\n\nAs commerce secretary, Lutnick would have a key role in carrying out Trump\u2019s plans to raise and enforce tariffs.",

The new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop both arrive with Copilot+ PC certification. Announced in May 2024, the program aims to identify business-focused devices that are designed specifically for the company\u2019s AI platform, Copilot.\n\nIt\u2019s a bid to integrate Microsoft\u2019s AI play more deeply into the Windows 11 experience. The new Surfaces arrive amid a post-CES flood of Copilot+ PCs, including those from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Copilot+ specifically refers to the inclusion of a neural processing unit (NPU), which allows for many features like Live Translation, Super Res, Recall, and Studio Effects to be performed on device.\n\nBoth devices ship with either an Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) or Snapdragon X processor. Earlier this month at CES, Qualcomm revealed plans to bring its 4nm Snapdragon chip to mid-range systems. Extended battery life and a lower price point are the processor\u2019s primary advantages over the Intel option. In fact, Qualcomm promises \u201cmulti-day\u201d use on a single charge compared to Intel\u2019s 22 hours. The primary tradeoff, however, is a reduction in system performance \u2014 though Surface corporate VP Brett Ostrum tells TechCrunch that Copilot performance should remain largely unaffected.\n\nCopilot is a major focus for both configurations. For the Snapdragon, that means an eight-core processor with a devoted NPU specifically designed to manage AI workloads. The Series 2 Intel Core chips, meanwhile, are said to offer up to a 28% CPU performance and 98% graphics performance boost.\n\nLater this year, the Surface Laptop for business will get a 5G option for the first time. That connectivity is key to a play that combines local AI compute with cloud-based processing.\n\nMost current generative AI platforms require more resources than consumer devices can provide, requiring that workload to be offloaded to remote servers. But this week\u2019s DeepSeek reveal has turned the spotlight back to lighter-weight and more focused models that can run on-device. The Chinese AI startup\u2019s strategy involves \u201cdistilled\u201d versions of its R1 AI model capable of running on a laptop. Similarly, Apple has based its Apple Intelligence platform on smaller models that can run locally.\n\nMicrosoft is clearly interested in offering more on-device AI experiences, too. Much like Apple Intelligence, however, many of Copilot\u2019s processes require more powerful hardware than can currently be crammed into a laptop. The addition of 5G is a bid to create a constant level of connectivity to assure that Copilot queries don\u2019t come up blank over an inability to access remote servers.\n\nThe Surface Pro for Business features a 13-inch display with an OLED option and a built-in NFC reader to utilize security keys including those from YubiKey. The Surface Laptop comes in 13.8- and 15-inch options.\n\nBoth Intel Core models start at $1,500. It\u2019s a $400 premium over the Snapdragon devices, which are primarily targeted toward consumers \u2014 though they can obviously be deployed for business as needed, as well. The 5G version of the Surface Laptop, meanwhile, will be available at some point later in 2025. Pricing for that will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe line is also getting a new USB4 Dock, priced at $200. The hub features two USB-C, one USB-A, Ethernet, and HDMI ports. It arrives on February 18, alongside the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro.",

    "raw_text": "Landy Liu knows how hard it is to save for a home.\n\nWhile working at mortgage startup Better.com, he spent years dealing with first-home home buyers who felt overwhelmed when it came to shopping for homes. By the time it was his turn in 2022, mortgage rates had nearly doubled, and he found himself in one of the most challenging home-buying environments in decades.\n\n\u201cI put my purchase on hold and used my down payment to start Foyer, where I am a user alongside our members,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nFoyer is a platform that helps consumers save for down payments, essentially acting as a \u201c401(k) for homeownership,\u201d Liu said. He noted that specialized saving accounts and apps exist these days for nearly every big milestone, \u201cretirement, college tuition, even major health expenses,\u201d he said. Yet while there are general options in the market for saving up for down payments, there is nothing akin to a platform focused on down payments for homes.\n\n\u201cWe believe homeownership is a vital part of the American dream and first-time home buyers need all the help they can get,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Foyer, users can create target savings goals and access personalized guidance on the best ways to save for a home, information about mortgage rates, and choosing a real estate firm. The company has a subscription model, offering memberships to users looking for more support. It can connect users with real estate professionals and also allows customers to earn rewards that can be used toward a home purchase.\n\n\u201cReal estate service providers spend billions annually marketing to end users and now they are able to more directly support the financial wellness of aspiring home buyers,\u201d Liu said.\n\nBuying a home has become quite challenging in the past few years, with many aspiring home buyers finding themselves priced out of the market completely, far away from hitting the milestones that generations previously hit at young ages. \u201cSaving for one\u2019s home requires better planning than ever,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestors clearly see some shine in the idea. Today, Foyer is announcing a $6.2 million seed round led by Alpaca VC and Hometeam Ventures. Accion Venture Lab and Clocktower Ventures also participated in the round.\n\n\u201cHomeownership plays a crucial role in building long-term financial security, particularly for underserved communities that have historically been shut out of wealth-building opportunities,\u201d Amee Parbhoo, a managing partner at Accion Venture Lab, told TechCrunch.\n\nDavid Goldberg, general partner at Alpaca VC, said what drew the firm to Foyer was its \u201creimagined approach to homeownership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe combination of high-yield savings, education, and strategic partnerships makes this a compelling bet on the future of home buying,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nLiu said he met the lead investors through mutual connections in the fintech and proptech space. For now, Liu said Foyer\u2019s main competition is traditional savings accounts. Foyer launched last year in Michigan but has since spread throughout the country, attracting more than 10,000 users, it said.\n\nThe fresh capital will help the company expand and enhance product features.\n\n\u201cHome affordability is in crisis and yet homeownership remains the greatest source of wealth creation for middle-class and minority families in the United States,\u201d Liu said. \u201cFoyer is providing a solution for first-time home buyers, a dedicated savings account that works for the next generation of homeowners.\u201d",

The next Samsung Unpacked event is set for today at 10 a.m. PT, 1 p.m. ET.\n\nAs with all recent Unpacked events, the big show will be streamed both directly through Samsung\u2019s site, as well as the company\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nSamsung is so excited to get the preorders flowing ahead of time that reservations prior to the event come with a $50 Samsung store credit. You can find all of the fine print on that over here.\n\nThe one absolute slam dunk for the event is the Galaxy S25 line. Since breaking off from CES/MWC for its mobile announcements, the company has developed a twice-a-year cadence for flagship releases. We get the Galaxy S series around January/February, followed by new foldables over the summer.\n\nThe line should include three key models: the S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra, the latter of which is the product of the S line absorbing the Galaxy Note as its biggest, most premium device. Per the usual, the lead-up to the event has been peppered with leaks, renders, and cases. The latter gives us a general sense of dimensions for the line, as they are built to specs submitted by Samsung to the manufacturer.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of rumors point to the S25 looking a whole lot like its predecessor. The biggest change on the hardware front is a slimmer design. Rumors published this week point to Samsung shaving 1 to 2 millimeters off the device\u2019s profile. Another nearly certain rumor is the inclusion of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip that Qualcomm unveiled in Hawaii last October. (The usual caveat is that there\u2019s always a bit of processor variation in international markets. Here in the States, however, it\u2019s pretty much a done deal.)\n\nGalaxy AI will, of course, be the centerpiece as Samsung looks not only to present itself as a leader in the category, but also differentiate its offering from Google Gemini features that will be available across Android devices. Of course, last year\u2019s big AI announcement was Circle to Search, a Google feature that launched on the S24 first.",

    "raw_text": "Jetify, the company formerly known as Jetpack.io, is launching its first AI agent product Tuesday. Dubbed Testpilot, the company\u2019s first AI agent is meant to make the majority of the routine test-creation process a matter of simply letting Jetify create a test plan, execute it, and report back, all while the agent directly interacts with the user interface.\n\nRight now, Testpilot works for web-based applications, but the team is also planning to launch mobile testing soon.\n\nThe company\u2019s original focus was mostly on creating dev environments in the cloud. While it will still offer those (though maybe with a stronger focus on making those API-driven), Jetify CEO and co-founder Daniel Loreto describes Tuesday\u2019s launch as a bit of a pivot and as the first in a series of AI agent launches, all of which will focus on improving the software development life cycle.\n\n\u201cWe feel, and I\u2019m sure a lot of people feel this way, that AI is truly one of those once-every-30-year technology waves that comes along. It\u2019s like the invention of the internet or mobile, right? So having the opportunity to be part of that wave and to really participate in it convinced us that, yes, let\u2019s take the risk. Let\u2019s shift,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe team decided that the best way to get started with AI agents was to work on something that solved a clear pain point for developers. Nobody likes writing tests \u2014 and when it comes to UI testing, existing tools like Selenium can quickly become brittle with even the slightest UI changes. That\u2019s also exactly what AI tools are good at handling: They won\u2019t break, even when a button moves a few pixels to the left.\n\nLoreto also noted that QA teams are already used to using third-party tools for testing their applications, making Testpilot an easier sell. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-defined motion that companies say, \u2018Yeah, we need this end-to-end testing, and we\u2019re willing to hire a third party to help us with that,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nHe also stressed that this kind of end-to-end testing is easy to integrate into the development process since all the company needs from the developer is access to log in to the application that the service is meant to test. Since Testpilot looks at the actual application, not the underlying code, it doesn\u2019t need access to GitHub or any other code repository, for example.\n\nHowever, even though Testpilot today can cover 60% to 70% of tests that humans would likely come up with, there is still a gap. That\u2019s something Jetify acknowledges, but as Loreto noted, he thinks that this is still \u201ca huge value-add.\u201d\n\nAs of now, potential users still have to go through an onboarding flow with Jetify. Soon, the team hopes to launch a self-service version as well (with mobile support following after that). Jetify is still experimenting with how best to price the service, which is, in part, why the company hasn\u2019t launched a self-service version yet.",

After it added a new TikTok-like custom video feed last week in the wake of the U.S. ban on the popular video app (now on pause), the company on Monday announced it\u2019s adding a new video tab to Bluesky user profiles.\n\nThe tab will allow people to showcase the videos they\u2019ve uploaded to Bluesky, whether that\u2019s original content or something they grabbed from other social networks, including, of course, TikTok. But in addition to simply chasing the potential for more video-based social activity, video could potentially offer Bluesky another revenue stream if it catches on. The company could charge for features like longer or higher-quality video as part of its upcoming premium subscription plan, if it chooses.\n\nHowever, not all Bluesky users are ready for their network to become just another TikTok rival. Some people are even asking in the replies to the company\u2019s announcement if they\u2019ll be able to disable the tab on their own profiles. Others are requesting that Bluesky prioritizes other features they\u2019re used to on X, like an Edit button.\n\nStill, there\u2019s clear demand and developer interest in building video-first Bluesky clients at present.\n\nSeveral developers are already working on \u201cBluesky TikTok\u201d apps, including Berlin developer Sebastian Vogelsang, who makes the Bluesky apps Skeets and now Flashes (a \u201cBluesky Instagram\u201d of sorts), and the teams behind upcoming apps Reelo and Skylight, for instance.\n\nCeleb investor and entrepreneur Mark Cuban even recently said he\u2019s open to backing a video app built on the AT Protocol, which powers Bluesky.\n\nThe new user profile video tab was introduced in the Bluesky 1.97 update, which also adds a menu for blocking a user or deleting a conversation after reporting a DM (direct message) and other translation improvements.",

The simply named Roli Piano builds on products like the Roli Airwave and Piano M, more than doubling the latter\u2019s key count to 49.\n\nThe Piano is much like its predecessor in most ways, with MIDI keys that light up and sync with an instructional app played back on a phone or tablet. The Airwave, meanwhile, adds hand tracking into the mix, creating gesture-based sounds.\n\nThe new instrument is pricey, at $599, well over double the Piano M\u2019s current $249 price point. The London-based music tech startup is offering up the larger model at $399 for a limited time \u201csuper early bird special.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a 2025 product launch without some mention of generative AI. That arrives by way of the newly announced Piano AI Assistant, which the company refers to as, \u201cthe first step in using generative AI to make learning to play easier, more intuitive and more fun than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe Assistant, which is rolling out as part of the Piano launch, aims to further instruction, while adding music theory into the mix.\n\nOver the past year, the Piano line has become Roli\u2019s primary focus. The pivot toward educational products makes sense for the company, which filed for bankruptcy back in 2021. Products like the Seaboard and Blocks were always cool and clever, but remained niche in the music world.\n\nMusic education, on the other hand, offers massive market potential for a smaller hardware maker.",

    "raw_text": "The mobile app for DeepSeek, a Chinese AI lab, skyrocketed to the No. 1 spot in app stores around the globe this weekend, topping the U.S.-based AI chatbot, ChatGPT. On iOS, DeepSeek is currently the No. 1 free app in the U.S. App Store and 51 other countries, according to mobile app analytics firm Appfigures.\n\nThe rapid rise of DeepSeek in the app stores\u2019 Top Charts follows its meteoric rise in popularity this week resulting from the release of a series of open AI models that are competitive with leading offerings from OpenAI and Google. However, compared to other frontier AI models, DeepSeek claims its models were trained for just a fraction of the price with significantly worse AI chips. This represents new efficiency gains for AI model training, which sent Nvidia\u2019s stock price tumbling down as much as 17% on Monday and has put the rest of the tech industry on high alert.\n\nOn Friday, DeepSeek\u2019s mobile app had just a million downloads across both the App Store and Google Play. That number has since doubled as of Monday morning, to 2.6 million downloads of DeepSeek\u2019s mobile app across both platforms.\n\nThe app currently sits in the Top 10 list for free apps in 111 countries on the App Store and in 18 countries on Google Play, according to Appfigures.\n\nIn addition, more than 80% of DeepSeek\u2019s total mobile app downloads have come in the past seven days, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. In that time frame, DeepSeek saw nearly 300% more app downloads than Perplexity, another leading consumer AI app.\n\nDeepSeek moved into its No. 1 spot on the U.S. App Store on Sunday, January 26, up from No. 31 just a couple days prior. Meanwhile, DeepSeek is the No. 14 Overall free app on Google Play, rapidly climbing up from No. 133 on January 24.\n\nAs a result, daily active users jumped both globally and in the U.S. by over 110% from January 24 to 25 compared with the same period last week.\n\nWhile China is the largest mobile app market for DeepSeek today, it represents only 23% of its total downloads, according to Sensor Tower. The app\u2019s second and third largest markets are the United States, which makes up 15% of its total downloads, and Egypt, which makes up 6% of its total downloads.\n\nThe popularity of DeepSeek\u2019s mobile app raises questions about the moat of popular consumer AI apps, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. While hundreds of millions of people use ChatGPT and Gemini every month, DeepSeek proves that the consumer AI space is still volatile, and new competitors shouldn\u2019t be counted out.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that reaching the No. 1 position on the App Store isn\u2019t just calculated by app downloads alone.\n\nApple\u2019s algorithm, though secretive, is a combination of numerous factors, including velocity of the installs and more. That allows apps that gain installs quickly to skyrocket to the top of the charts, overtaking others that may have a larger total number of users or installs. It will be more telling to see how long DeepSeek holds its top position over time.\n\nThe tech industry is still coming to terms with the techniques DeepSeek used to train its AI models, and what it means for the broader AI space. In light of DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model, leading AI model providers may be feeling pressured to release better models to prove their dominance, or justify the hefty price they\u2019re paying for compute. Meta has reportedly created several \u201cwar rooms\u201d to analyze DeepSeek\u2019s training methods.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s rise in popularity was potentially stifled by \u201clarge-scale malicious\u201d attacks, the company reported on Monday, which forced it to limit customers outside of China from registering for the app.\n\nAdditional reporting by Sarah Perez.",

Its jewelry business, called Nek, is seeing annualized sales of about $13 million annually, according to the investor note.\n\nThe new offerings come at a time when the Bengaluru-headquartered startup is in talks to raise as much as $50 million in a new round of funding, according to Indian newspaper Economic Times.\n\nJar declined to comment on the fundraising talks.",

    "raw_text": "LinkedIn, the social platform where people look for and talk about work, may be less visible in Microsoft\u2019s earnings compared to the years when it was an independent company. But around earnings time, LinkedIn often reveals some figures that point to how it continues to grow.\n\nOn Wednesday, as Microsoft reported its Q2 numbers, the company noted that LinkedIn revenue has grown 9% over the last year. And later, in earnings remarks, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella confirmed that LinkedIn passed a record $2 billion in Premium subscriptions revenue in the last 12 months.\n\nLinkedIn, which now has more than 1 billion users (Premium and free) is not disclosing how much it has made in total revenue in that 12-month period, nor what other business divisions of LinkedIn are generating. But for some points of reference:\n\nIn March 2024, LinkedIn noted that Premium subscriptions revenue was at $1.7 billion for 12 months.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that in 2024, LinkedIn had revenue of about $16.2 billion. Doing the rough math, that means that Premium subs are around 12.5% of LinkedIn\u2019s revenue.\n\nThese numbers are significant, but Microsoft\u2019s newer lines of business, specifically AI, are growing faster and may soon overshadow it. In remarks earlier Wednesday, Nadella noted that AI made $13 billion in an annual revenue run rate this quarter, up 175% on last year. Indeed, later in the earnings call, LinkedIn said that it expected future revenue to grow in the \u201clow- to mid- single digits\u201d dragged by headwinds in Talent Solutions division.\n\nNevertheless, the $2 billion figure is a milestone for LinkedIn and speaks to the push that the company has been making to fold in a growing number of extra features into the paid tiers to persuade more users to sign on and pay up. The overall number has grown around 50% in the last two years, the company tells TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cBuilding a $2B revenue subscription business is something only a handful of digitally native companies in history have ever accomplished,\u201d LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky told TechCrunch in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on designing and continuing to iterate on a model that is value-orientated to meet the needs of our subscribers \u2014 those who want to accelerate their career or grow their business. We bet big on our investment in AI tools to help our subscribers accelerate how they connect to opportunity, and it\u2019s paying off.\u201d\n\nLinkedIn has been fairly selective about what it discloses about its financial and user figures since Microsoft acquired it in 2016, choosing to focus on good news to offset less strong numbers.\n\nThe $2 billion figure comes as Microsoft reported Q2 earnings that indicated growth slowed in its cloud business \u2014 a slowdown that sent the company\u2019s shares down in aftermarket trading.",

    "raw_text": "When George Avetisov was the founder and CEO of cybersecurity startup HYPR, he spent a lot of time in the trenches with the company\u2019s sales team. He quickly realized that regardless of how good his sales team was, they were consistently pulling in other departments to answer customer questions or fill out technical questionnaires.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know the answers to most questions that get asked of them,\u201d Avetisov told TechCrunch. \u201cThey have to ask a product person, they have to pull in a sales engineer. It\u2019s a daunting task, and these people are brilliant, like I\u2019ve worked with some amazing sales reps, but the problem with sales is there\u2019s no easy way for them to automate knowledge.\u201d\n\nAvetisov (pictured above in the center) decided that would be his next problem to solve. He left HYPR in 2021 and took a brief interlude from startups to play and beat video game Elden Ring; Avetisov said he wanted a little downtime before being all-consumed by another startup. He launched his new company, 1up, in 2022.\n\n1up is an AI-powered knowledge automation platform for sales teams that pulls information from internal company data sources and databases. Sales professionals can turn to 1up to find answers to their product or technical questions, execute requests for proposal and also use it to help fill out technical questionnaires.\n\nThe company launched publicly in January 2024 and has since amassed nearly 100 customers that range from startups to large enterprise customers including WalkMe and Deliveroo. The company has been able to land a not insignificant portion of these customers through an unorthodox marketing strategy: memes.\n\n\u201cWe run one of the biggest sales meme libraries in the community, and we get millions of impressions on LinkedIn,\u201d Avetisov said. \u201cPeople follow us just from our memes. I know it\u2019s a little weird, but like, one out of three of our leads comes from a meme.\u201d\n\nNow the company is announcing a $5 million funding round led by Upfront Ventures with participation from RRE Ventures and 8-Bit Capital, among others. Upfront general partner Kobie Fuller is the lead investor and will take a seat on the company\u2019s board.\n\nFuller told TechCrunch that he got a cold email from Avetisov just days after one of his portfolio companies mentioned 1up might be a good fit for Fuller\u2019s investment thesis regarding how AI will change enterprise\u2019s approach to knowledge. When talking about this thesis to Avetisov, Fuller said they were speaking the exact same language.\n\n\u201cSo much of how we make investment decisions is around the founder and George, a second-time founder, saw the problem and pain point firsthand,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cWhen we talk with George, he can dive in at whatever level or depth in a manor you don\u2019t see all the time with CEOs. You can tell he\u2019s mission driven, he has 1up tattooed on his inner wrist. He\u2019s really, really in it; he\u2019s incredibly scrappy.\u201d\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT in 2022, AI startups building for sales departments have exploded, especially when it comes to building AI tools that help customers generate sales leads and with client outreach. Companies looking to provide knowledge centers for enterprises, many of which popped up prior to 2022, started gaining momentum, too.\n\nAvetisov isn\u2019t deterred, though. He said that 1up provides such a different service than the AI sales lead generators that he doesn\u2019t think 1up is competing for the same line in a company\u2019s budget. He said that he doesn\u2019t think companies need all-encompassing knowledge centers, but 1up\u2019s approach is different because it solves a specific problem.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk to the enterprise, knowledge management is not a budget item. It\u2019s not a hair on fire problem,\u201d Avetisov said. \u201cOur philosophy on this is that for knowledge automation to succeed and become a billion-dollar company or industry, it needs to be laser-focused on a persona and on a department.\u201d\n\nThe next steps for 1up, now that it has raised this recent funding, is to scale out the sales team. There will also be some feature upgrades, though Avetisov wasn\u2019t ready to share the details on those quite yet.\n\n\u201cSales teams get a lot of shit,\u201d Avetisov said. \u201cThey have one of the hardest jobs in the company, and their tool set is horrible. They\u2019ve got so many tools for prospecting and CRMs and all that stuff. But when it comes to knowledge management, they have been completely neglected. So that\u2019s our hot take. That\u2019s our laser focus.\u201d\n\nThis piece has been updated to remove Jonathan Abrams as an angel investor; Abrams invested through his fund 8-Bit Capital.",

    "raw_text": "Swedish shared micromobility giant Voi had its first profitable year in 2024, according to preliminary unaudited results the company shared exclusively with TechCrunch.\n\nVoi, which offers shared e-scooters and e-bikes across more than 100 markets in Europe, recorded \u20ac132.8 million ($138 million) in net revenue in 2024. On an adjusted basis, Voi earned \u20ac17.2 million ($17.9 million) in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) profit, and around \u20ac100,000 ($104,000) in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).\n\nWhile \u20ac100,000 profit (on an adjusted basis) doesn\u2019t seem like much to go on, Voi\u2019s founder and CEO, Fredrik Hjelm, told TechCrunch that the company\u2019s modest results demonstrate Voi\u2019s ability to improve its bottom line by 100 percentage points since 2021, in a \u201ctough industry with lots of ups and downs.\u201d\n\nLime, another industry leader, reported full-year profitability in 2023.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re starting to show real cash positive financials and EBIT profitability, so we\u2019re getting to a place where we\u2019d be a good candidate for the public markets in, say, two to three years from now,\u201d Hjelm said.\n\nHjelm also noted that a business that revolves around physical assets should highlight EBIT profitability over EBITDA because it\u2019s a metric that better captures the operational cost structure.\n\nVoi didn\u2019t share other financial information like net income and operating expenses. Hjelm said the company would release that information with a more detailed audited report at the end of February.\n\nHjelm did note that Voi\u2019s vehicle profit margins \u2014 which grew to 57%, up from 49% in 2023 \u2014 can be considered a \u201cproxy\u201d for the company\u2019s gross margin.\n\nThe CEO attributes Voi\u2019s improved bottom line to a series of cost-cutting measures and efficiency improvements such as automation on the product side, and using machine learning models to power predictive maintenance or determine battery-swapping schedules. He claimed this has also helped Voi improve the lifespan of its current fleet to around eight years, which has been a \u201cbig driver of profitability improvements.\u201d\n\n\u201cA thousand small things that distill down to one thing, which is really a focus on discipline and obsession with small details,\u201d Hjelm said.\n\nVehicle utilization is also healthy, he said, with each vehicle averaging out at up to 10 rides per day during peak months and two rides per day at off-peak.\n\n\u201cThe first years [of shared micromobility] were quite chaotic when it came to how many players were in the market, location accuracy on the vehicles, parking clutter, and so on,\u201d Hjelm said. \u201cOver the last three years, we have seen cities maturing and taking what they consider to be the most suitable players to run micromobility schemes in their cities. And that has improved both public acceptance but also profitability on the bottom line for us.\u201d\n\nVoi ended 2024 with \u20ac60 million ($62 million) in cash and cash equivalents. In October 2024, Voi secured \u20ac125 million in senior secured bonds ($130 million) that are mainly backed by Nordic and American institutional investors \u2014 a step change for the startup that had until then raised $675.56 million in equity from VCs, according to PitchBook data.\n\n\u201cMe and my CFO said at the end of 2021 that we don\u2019t want to be dependent on equity investors anymore, so let\u2019s turn this company profitable,\u201d Hjelm said.\n\nVoi completed its first drawdown of \u20ac50 million ($52 million) from the bond issuance, money that will go toward helping Voi expand its fleet and launch in new markets across Europe. Today, Voi counts about 100,000 vehicles in its fleet \u2014 90% of which are scooters.\n\n\u201cThis year, we\u2019re increasing our bike fleet significantly over the next couple of months,\u201d Hjelm said.\n\n\u201cRaising a public bond is proof of trust from the very sophisticated public debt bond investors,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked if Voi plans to use any of its cash to acquire other companies \u2014 there have been rumors that Voi is acquiring Bolt\u2019s micromobility business \u2014 Hjelm said that there is no confirmed acquisition offer.\n\n\u201cBut I would buy it at the right price,\u201d he said. \u201cBolt is great, but we do micromobility better!\u201d",

The deal is expected to close in the June quarter, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe announcement confirms TechCrunch\u2019s report from earlier this month.\n\nThe deal gives Unilever\u2019s Indian unit a stronger foothold in the premium beauty segment, adding to its portfolio of brands like Dove, Pond\u2019s, and Lakm\u00e9. Minimalist, known for its actives-led skincare products, reported annual revenue run rate of over \u20b95 billion and has been profitable since inception.\n\nMinimalist has built a strong presence in e-commerce, which Hindustan Unilever plans to complement by expanding the brand\u2019s offline distribution using its extensive retail network.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mohit Yadav and Rahul Yadav, Jaipur-based Minimalist sells a range of products, from sunscreens to hair-repair serums. The startup had previously attracted investment from Unilever Ventures in its Series A round in 2021. Peak XV was its first institutional investor, leading the seed funding in the startup through its Surge platform in late 2019. Minimalist was one of the earliest startups in the Surge portfolio.\n\nThe acquisition follows Hindustan Unilever\u2019s expansion into health and well-being through acquisitions of Oziva and Wellbeing Nutrition last year.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition is another key step to grow our Beauty & Wellbeing portfolio in the high growth masstige beauty segment,\u201d Rohit Jawa, CEO of Hindustan Unilever, said in a statement.\n\nMinimalist\u2019s founders will continue to run the business for two years after the deal closes.\n\nThe deal values Minimalist higher than the roughly $300 million valuation it reportedly sought when attempting to raise venture capital in the second half of last year, according to previous media reports.",

However, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator\u2019s.\n\nOpenAI says its policies around data retention for Operator are designed to combat abuse. \u201cAs agents are a relatively new technology, we wanted to make sure our teams have the time to better understand and review potential abuse vectors,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cThis retention period allows us to enhance fraud monitoring and ensure the product remains safe from misuse, while still giving users control over their data.\u201d\n\nOpenAI announced Operator on Thursday and released it in a research preview for subscribers to the company\u2019s $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan. Operator is a general-purpose AI agent with a built-in browser that can independently perform certain actions on websites.\n\nOpenAI claims that Operator can automate tasks like booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. There are several task categories users can choose from within the Operator interface, including shopping, delivery, dining, and travel.\n\nOperator captures screenshots of its built-in browser to help it understand how and when to take actions in apps, like when to use buttons and which forms to complete. To be clear, Operator doesn\u2019t capture screenshots when it gets \u201cstuck,\u201d like when the tool needs a password. OpenAI calls this \u201ctake over\u201d mode.\n\nStill, some users may be wary of volunteering screenshots of their online activities to a company that may keep them for upwards of three months. OpenAI notes that, as with ChatGPT, Operator data may be accessed by \u201ca limited number of authorized OpenAI personnel\u201d and \u201ctrusted service providers\u201d for purposes like investigating abuse and handling legal matters.",

That\u2019s led to a reckoning in Silicon Valley \u2014 and at the highest levels of the U.S. government.\n\nGemini 2.0 Pro Experimental, which is available to Gemini Advanced users beginning Thursday, is now the leading model in Google\u2019s Gemini AI family, the company said.

    "raw_text": "President Donald Trump is trying to halt the flow of funding for EV charging infrastructure from two programs that have benefited Tesla \u2014 the latest example of how Elon Musk\u2019s political interests seem to be at odds with his car company\u2019s goal of advancing sustainable energy.\n\nIt\u2019s not a given that Trump\u2019s gambit will succeed. But if it does, Tesla could be cut off from two sources of funding that the automaker has tapped the past two years to build out its market-leading EV charging network.\n\nIn one of the myriad executive orders Trump signed on the first day of his second term, he declared that \u201c[a]ll agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds\u201d from programs created by the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He specifically calls out stopping funding for EV charging stations that\u2019s been made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) grant program.\n\nThose agencies are supposed to submit a review of \u201cprocesses, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements\u201d within 90 days of the date of this order, and all agency heads shall submit a report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Economic Council (NEC). The order also states that agencies cannot disburse more funds unless the \u201cDirector of OMB and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy have determined that such disbursements are consistent with any review recommendations they have chosen to adopt.\u201d\n\nMusk has long claimed that Tesla\u2019s mission is \u201caccelerating the transition to sustainable energy.\u201d But he is now officially working with the second Trump administration, which took big swings at sustainable energy on its first day. Trump has already signed orders halting federal leases for offshore wind development, pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, and is trying to reverse other Biden administration EV policies.\n\nTesla was recently part of a group that won a $100 million award from the CFI program to build out charging infrastructure for heavy-duty electric trucks across Illinois, as TechCrunch first reported last week. The company was hoping to secure around $40 million from the group\u2019s original funding request of $126 million. Tesla has also repeatedly sought around $100 million in CFI funding to build a truck-charging corridor between Northern California and southern Texas, but that application has been passed over multiple times.\n\nTesla\u2019s CFI award in Illinois is a small portion of the nearly $2 billion the Department of Transportation has allocated over the last two years. Tesla has won a much greater share of grants from the NEVI program \u2014 which doles out smaller amounts of money to states, which, in turn, use those funds to offer grants to build charging infrastructure. Tesla had won around 13% of all NEVI awards by the middle of 2024 and was using those millions to further build out its Supercharger network, which is now open to almost all competing EVs.\n\nTrump could slow or stop the flow of future spending from these programs, according to Martin Lockman, a fellow at Columbia Law School\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. He might especially be able to do so if his administration is successful in its promised legal fight over the Impoundment Control Act, which limits the president\u2019s ability to stop Congress from spending money that\u2019s been appropriated.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of wiggle room here, and the Trump administration will certainly do everything that it can to delay spending under these bills,\u201d Lockman said.\n\nIt is not clear that Trump can legally stop the funding of awards that are already under contract, though.\n\n\u201cPeople who have contracts today have rights under those contracts, and the President can\u2019t take them away,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, Lockman cautioned, if agencies feel enough pressure from Trump, they could violate the terms of those contracts \u2014 and potentially the laws that established the funding programs in the first place \u2014 and refuse to give out the money. In that situation, the companies, state and local agencies, or other entities that won awards from NEVI or CFI would have to fight to get them fulfilled.\n\n\u201cIf the new administration wants to make people fight for their contracts in court, that would certainly be a huge barrier to building EV infrastructure,\u201d he said.",

    "raw_text": "Over the years, Ramp has built a name for itself in the corporate card and expense management space. It\u2019s branched out into travel, bill pay, and more, while raising over $1.2 billion in venture funding.\n\nToday, the six-year-old fintech startup is announcing a different kind of expansion \u2014 one that takes it into more of the digital bank territory \u2014 with a new product called Ramp Treasury.\n\nIn a nutshell, Ramp aims to give its customers a way to earn money and not just save cash, explains CEO and co-founder Eric Glyman, in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cWe looked at checking accounts and deposits that clients had linked to Ramp and realized that the vast majority were earning 0.00% interest,\u201d he said. Ramp Treasury, Glyman added, is designed to work alongside a customer\u2019s existing bank accounts, not replace them.\n\nWith Ramp\u2019s new Treasury product, businesses can store cash in a business account and earn 2.5% or in a money market fund for potentially higher yields. They can have quicker access to their cash to pay bills, he said, considering cash stored in the business account is liquid.\n\nAs with other fintechs operating in the space, Ramp is not a bank but rather is partnering with banks on the offering, Glyman emphasizes. The startup is partnering with First Internet Bank of Indiana on the cash deposit account and Apex on the investment side.\n\nRamp operates in a crowded space that includes a host of competitors such as Mercury, Brex, Navan, Rho, and Mesh Payments. Brex, perhaps the most well-known of the bunch, at one time years ago had applied for a bank charter before later opting not to go that route.\n\nFor its part, Ramp is not aspiring to be a digital bank. But the step into offering a treasury account is a big one for the company that is expected to boost Ramp\u2019s bottom line, Glyman said. It\u2019s also helping it become more of a one-stop shop for its customers by allowing them to keep more of their cash in one place rather than move it around between different entities and accounts.\n\nFor now, the company is staying mum on its revenue figures. In March 2023, Glyman told TechCrunch that Ramp saw its revenue grow by 4x in 2022 \u2014 led by its fastest-growing segment of bill pay \u2014 but was not yet profitable. The company had crossed $100 million in annualized revenue before its third birthday in March 2022 and said in the summer of 2023 that it had passed $300 million in annualized revenue.\n\nToday, Glyman shared only that Ramp now has more than 30,000 customers, up from about 15,000 this time last year, and that it powered over $50 billion in purchases across cards and bill payments. About 18 months ago, that figure was closer to $10 billion, according to Ramp.\n\nThe company primarily makes money from interchange fees charged for every swipe with a Ramp card as well as from transaction fees on bill payments. It also earns SaaS revenue from customers who upgrade to its Plus offering, through foreign exchange from international money movement, affiliate fees when flights or hotels are booked through its travel product, among other things.\n\nWith the addition of its Treasury product, Ramp will also earn a spread from its bank partners on aggregate balances across all funds held in a customer\u2019s business account.\n\n\u201cWe pass much of this back to the customer in the form of the earn rate we promote, but we do maintain some economics to ensure profitability,\u201d Glyman said.\n\nRamp is one of the few large fintechs that has not had to lay off employees in recent years, although like most others, its valuation has taken a hit from previous highs. Last April, it raised $150 million in a round led by Khosla Ventures and Founders Fund at a post-money valuation of $7.65 billion. That financing did bring it back closer to the $8.1 billion valuation it had achieved in March of 2022.\n\nThe startup crossed the 1,000 employee mark by the end of 2024, Glyman said \u2014 up from 730 at the time of its raise last April.\n\nLooking ahead, Glyman said Ramp is eyeing an IPO in the long term.\n\n\u201cWe are just trying to build a great business, regardless if it\u2019s private or public,\u201d he said.\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

    "raw_text": "To make smart bets on the current wave of startups, Matt Hartman thinks venture capitalists will need a deeper understanding of the tech those startups are building.\n\nHartman (pictured above) spent nine years as a partner at Betaworks before starting a new firm, Factorial Capital, where he\u2019s developed a different approach to identifying the startups with the most promising tech innovations. His mantra: \u201cTo invest in software, you need to know how software works.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that other VCs ignore technology. But Hartman said most firms are built to evaluate consumer brands and other businesses that have already achieved product-market fit; technical diligence usually comes at the very end of the dealmaking process and is often limited to consulting CTOs at the firm\u2019s existing portfolio companies.\n\nThis approach falls short, in Hartman\u2019s view, especially when it comes to AI and other sectors where technical differentiation is key.\n\n\u201cTechnology startups want capital from people who understand what they\u2019re building, and most venture firms today were not actually set up to understand technology pre-product market fit,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s unlikely that a lone VC will have the technical expertise necessary to seriously evaluate a wide variety of startups, so Factorial\u2019s model relies on a network of technical founders, each one focusing on sourcing their own deals from their own networks and areas of expertise.\n\nClement Delangue, CEO of AI startup Hugging Face (which Hartman backed while at Betaworks), was Factorial\u2019s first sourcing partner. Now the firm is announcing some of its other partners: Giphy co-founder Alex Chung, Venmo co-founder Iqram Magdon-Ismail, Hugging Face co-founders Julien Chaumond and Thomas Wolf, Fast Forward Labs co-founder Hilary Mason, and Beme co-founder Matt Hackett.\n\nThose founders, Hartman said, are \u201cbest positioned to identify genuinely novel technical teams and products pre-product market fit.\u201d\n\nMagdon-Ismail added that he\u2019s \u201cexcited to back incredible founders like Substrate [and] Modal through this partnership.\u201d\n\n\u201cFounders love working with founders, and Factorial enables that,\u201d he said.\n\nHartman isn\u2019t the only investor betting that active founders will make better investors than full-time VCs. TechCrunch recently wrote about Powerset, an investment program that provides a small group of founders with $1 million each to invest in startups.\n\nIn the case of Factorial\u2019s sourcing partners, Hartman said they could write checks individually, and they do often invest their own money alongside the firm. But when they bring deals to Factorial, they can make bigger bets (the firm typically invests $500,000) and then receive half the carried interest from those deals.\n\nHartman is not yet disclosing the size of his first fund, but he\u2019s targeting 30 startup investments. (There\u2019s no quota for individual sourcing partners.) He added that the Factorial model has already allowed him to get ahead of much larger firms by investing early in promising AI startups.\n\nThe Factorial portfolio includes the aforementioned Substrate and Modal, as well as Factory AI, Pika, Modal, Patronus, Nomic, Flower, and Adaptive ML.",

The company is generating revenue from those customers in a number of ways, Komoni says, including through annual software fees for its cloud platform, tracker sales, and shipment monitoring services.\n\nKomoni expects Tive will reach profitability in 2026.\n\n\u201cTive\u2019s focus on supply chain solutions for all types of goods \u2014 durable, nondurable, perishable, industrial, consumer, and so on \u2014 positions it well to weather broader tech slowdowns and recessions,\u201d Komoni said. \u201cDespite the freight recession, which has been the norm since the end of COVID-19, Tive has consistently grown 50%+ year-over-year, and expects to grow at an accelerated rate in 2025.\u201d\n\nTo expand its Boston-based workforce of around 243 employees, Tive recently raised $40 million in a Series C round co-led by by World Innovation Lab and Sageview Capital with participation from AVP, RRE Ventures, Two Sigma Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, Fifth Wall, Supply Chain Ventures, and Sorenson Capital.\n\nThe new capital brings Tive\u2019s total raised to $120 million. In addition to hiring, Komoni said the new cash will be put toward developing new products, expanding Tive\u2019s sustainability programs (including its tracker recycling program), and bringing the platform to more countries.",

We need to learn from Salt Typhoon and protect ourselves better. The fact this isn\u2019t a priority for Trump is telling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop what you don\u2019t understand and the CSRB was arming us with understanding,\u201d the person added.\n\nThe person was referring to the CSRB\u2019s review of the devastating recent breaches at several telecoms in the U.S., allegedly carried out by Chinese government hackers.\n\nCISA spokesperson Valerie Mongello referred TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment to DHS.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, DHS provided a comment from an unnamed DHS senior official.\n\n\u201cEffective immediately, the Department of Homeland Security will no longer tolerate any advisory committee which push agendas that attempt to undermine its national security mission, the President\u2019s agenda or Constitutional rights of Americans,\u201d read the statement. The DHS spokesperson did not respond when asked to provide a name.\n\n\u201cIn alignment with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) commitment to eliminating the misuse of resources and ensuring that DHS activities prioritize our national security, I am directing the termination of all current memberships on advisory committees within DHS, effective immediately,\u201d read the letter sent to members of the CSRB.\n\nAnother person familiar with the matter pointed out that \u201cit\u2019s interesting that the rationale is \u2018misuse of resources\u2019 because all advisory board members get an excitingly rich salary of\u2026$0.\u201d\n\nKatie Moussouris, a cybersecurity expert with more than two decades of experience, and a former member of the CSRB, told TechCrunch that \u201cthe people who serve as government advisors should be judged by skills and merit, not by political affiliation. I\u2019m hopeful that these critical advisory board vacancies will be filled with the most qualified people without delay.\u201d\n\nThe CSRB investigated the breach of U.S. government email systems provided by Microsoft, also allegedly carried out by Chinese government hackers. In March of last year, the committee published a report on the incident, which was widely lauded in the cybersecurity community.\n\nOther DHS advisory committee members that are reportedly impacted by DHS\u2019s decision are those dedicated to artificial intelligence, telecommunications, science and technology, and emergency preparedness.",

    "raw_text": "U.S. edtech giant PowerSchool has begun notifying individuals affected by a December 2024 data breach that likely affects millions of students and teachers across North America.\n\nPowerSchool said in a brief update on Monday that it had started the process of filing legally required regulatory notifications following the breach, which saw attackers use a stolen account credential to access the company\u2019s customer support portal to exfiltrate huge quantities of sensitive student and teacher data. PowerSchool previously told TechCrunch that the hacked account was not protected with multi-factor authentication.\n\nThe California-based PowerSchool has already filed a data breach notification with Maine\u2019s attorney general, which confirms that more than 33,000 state residents had data stolen during the breach. Though Maine state law typically requires organizations to disclose the total number of individuals known to be affected by a breach, PowerSchool has not yet disclosed this figure.\n\nBleeping Computer, citing multiple sources, reports that the hackers responsible for the PowerSchool breach allegedly accessed the personal data of more than 62 million students and 9.5 million teachers. PowerSchool says on its website that its technology is used by more than 60 million students.\n\nWhen asked if the reported figure of 62 million students affected by the breach is accurate, PowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler (via crisis communications firm FTI Consulting) told TechCrunch that the company \u201ccannot confirm\u201d a precise number of affected individuals as the company\u2019s data review process is ongoing. PowerSchool added that the organization will be providing updates to state attorneys general as its process progresses, suggesting the number of affected Maine residents may be higher than the 33,000 reported figure to date.\n\n\u201cThis is a complicated process because the data review for on-premises customers requires additional collaboration between PowerSchool and those customers,\u201d PowerSchool\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nMillions of students already confirmed affected\n\nMany questions remain unanswered about the PowerSchool data breach: It is still unclear who was responsible for the attack; what evidence PowerSchool allegedly received that its stolen data was deleted; or the amount that the company paid in a ransom demand to the hackers. The lack of information surrounding the incident forced affected school districts to work together to investigate the impact and scale of the breach.\n\nIn a post on its incident page, PowerSchool says it cannot yet confirm what types of sensitive data were accessed \u201cbecause the answer varies by individual customer and is dependent on customer choice or district policies and requirements.\u201d TechCrunch has heard from multiple school districts affected by the breach that \u201call\u201d of their historical data stored in PowerSchool, including sensitive data such as information about parental access rights to their children, was accessed.\n\nToronto District School Board (TDSB), which last week confirmed that hackers had accessed close to 40 years\u2019 worth of student data, is the worst-hit organization so far, with the data of almost 1.5 million students taken in the breach. In a letter to parents, seen by TechCrunch, TDSB confirmed the stolen data includes genders, grade information, medical data, and accommodation details.\n\nBleeping Computer also lists the Calgary Board of Education (CBE) among those impacted by the breach, and reports that the data of more than 500,000 students was taken. In a statement to TechCrunch, CBE spokesperson Joanne Anderson said the board \u201cdoes not have confirmation from PowerSchool about the number of students and staff impacted and the details of the data taken.\u201d\n\nAffected school districts are also notifying those whose data was stolen during the PowerSchool breach. Idaho\u2019s West Ada School District, which has almost 40,000 students in K-12 classes, said in a letter, seen by TechCrunch, that personal information including \u201clife-safety health and grade information for current and former students\u201d had been accessed.\n\nAlexandria City Public Schools in Virginia, which serves more than 16,000 students, also confirmed that student data had been compromised. In a letter sent to parents, the district says that hackers accessed students\u2019 personal information, medical data, and free meal statuses.",

    "raw_text": "When Edoardo Dellepiane and Raffaele Sertorio founded Niko Energy in 2023, they saw ample opportunity in Mexico\u2019s underdeveloped solar market. Despite the fact that many parts of the country are bathed in sunlight, it has strikingly few solar installations.\n\nAfter more than a year of helping solar installers sell, plan, and finance panels for residential and small commercial building owners, they spotted another opportunity: building Mexico\u2019s first virtual power plant.\n\nDemand for power is surging in Mexico, and multinational corporations have been itching to build more factories in the country, provided they can get access to reliable power. But Mexico\u2019s grid is stretched thin, and blackouts were widespread last year during a drought that hobbled hydropower. A virtual power plant, or VPP, aggregates and controls things like home batteries, thermostats, and EV chargers. Controlling how much power those contribute to or draw from the grid could help ease the pain.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the new government put a lot of attention to this problem,\u201d Dellepiane told TechCrunch. \u201cWe want to be the company that manages the biggest portfolio of decentralized energy resources in Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to continue to finance new solar installations, said Andr\u00e9s Marquina, Niko\u2019s head of strategy. The number of projects Niko has serviced has grown 20% month over month, the company said. To build its VPP, it\u2019s also starting to sell battery storage to current solar owners and is looking to acquire portfolios from companies interested in selling assets. The company is aiming to amass tens of megawatts of capacity at the outset, Marquina said.\n\nThe renewed focus on Mexico and the VPP initiative represent a shift from the company\u2019s previous strategy, which envisioned copy-pasting its solar installation offering across Latin America. \u201cWe saw that Mexico is a huge untapped opportunity, so [we are] focusing on one country and doing it well before we move on to other parts,\u201d Sertorio said.\n\nPreviously, Niko sold mostly to homeowners and small businesses, which the founders said were underserved by other companies. The startup plans to continue pursuing those customers, but more recently it has also begun to court larger companies.\n\nSimilar to what it offers smaller customers, Niko will finance and facilitate the installation of solar panels for a large business. The contract is essentially a fee-for-service, which in this case is electricity. It can be canceled at any time, Dellepiane said, at which point Niko uninstalls the solar panels. But given that Niko expects companies to save on their energy bills, the startup doesn\u2019t think that will happen often. \u201cIt gives them peace of mind,\u201d Dellepiane said.\n\nTo facilitate more installations, and to develop the VPP platform, Niko has raised $8 million in equity, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by QED Investors with participation from 468 Capital and Picus Capital. The company also raised $15 million in debt.",

The company has now raised around $19 billion in financing over its 12-year history ($14 billion of that in equity).\n\nDatabricks has long been used for major data science projects. For example, companies use the platform to pool and analyze vast swaths of data from disparate systems to glean insights \u2014 for instance, a retailer might want to combine datasets to figure out which products sell best, at what times of year, to forecast inventory requirements.\n\nMore recently, Databricks has gained prominence as a major cog in AI projects. Data is pivotal to the burgeoning AI revolution, and Databricks serves as a unified platform for combining and standardizing data \u2014 structured and unstructured \u2014 vital for building and deploying machine learning models.\n\nThis latest Series J round \u2014 first announced in December, when Databricks had raised $8.6 billion \u2014 ushers in a slew of notable new and existing investors. In addition to Temasek and QIA (Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund), Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta is also backing Databricks as a \u201cstrategic investor.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Databricks is a customer of Meta\u2019s and/or the other way around. We\u2019re asking the companies and will update this post as we learn more.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that corporate investment into AI-aligned companies has become something of a trend, with Meta and Amazon joining a $1 billion investment into data-labeling startup Scale AI last year.\n\nWith this fresh cash injection, Databricks said that it plans to invest in new AI products, bolster its global \u201cgo to market\u201d operations, and fund new acquisitions.\n\nBut the big $62 billion question now, however, is what is happening with regards to Databricks\u2019 longstanding IPO plans?\n\nBack in December, Databricks\u2019 CEO Ali Ghodsi said it would be \u201cdumb to IPO\u201d last year, what with the election and new administration, as well as ongoing anxiety over the economy. He added that the \u201cearliest theoretical possibility\u201d for an IPO would be some time in 2025.\n\nHowever, the company also said that it\u2019s putting some of its fresh cash bounty toward providing liquidity to \u201ccurrent and former employees,\u201d suggesting an IPO might happen later rather than sooner.",

    "raw_text": "Nelly wants to become the biggest fintech startup in the healthcare industry. The Berlin-based startup is already working with more than 1,200 medical practices in a handful of European countries. But there are thousands more that could benefit from an upgrade for their administrative workflows.\n\nThat\u2019s why Nelly recently raised \u20ac50 million in funding (around $51 million at current exchange rates) in a Series B round led by Cathay Innovation, along with Notion Capital. Existing investors b2venture, Lakestar, Motive Ventures, and Arc Investors also participated once again.\n\nWhile many industries have fully switched to digital workflows, Nelly\u2019s founding team realized that many medical practices are lagging behind. \u201cI went to the doctor, I had to fill in all my data with pen and paper. And then four weeks later, I received a thick letter with a request to pay \u20ac120,\u201d Nelly co-founder and CEO Niklas Radner told TechCrunch.\n\nThe company started with a software-as-a-service product that lets medical practices onboard new patients digitally. Patients book an appointment and then receive a confirmation message via SMS, WhatsApp, or email with a link. They can click on that link and fill out their personal details and medical history.\n\n\u201cBut the reality today is that more than 50% of all appointments are still not scheduled digitally. They are scheduled by a phone call or by just walking into the practice,\u201d Radner said. That\u2019s why patients can also scan a QR code to open Nelly\u2019s portal from the waiting room.\n\nBehind the scenes, Nelly integrates with existing practice management systems. Data is updated and stored in these legacy systems so that practices don\u2019t have to switch to a new system altogether. These connectors are either built in house by the Nelly team or developed by Nelly\u2019s partners.\n\nThis onboarding system acts as the backbone for the rest of the product suite. \u201cYou could see Nelly as, let\u2019s say, a Typeform/DocuSign/Klarna for medical practices,\u201d Radner said. He was formerly a growth lead at Klarna.\n\nOn the patient side, in addition to online bookings and the onboarding features, patients can pay medical practices using online payments or Nelly-managed card readers. Patients can also receive reminders to leave a review on Google Maps.\n\nAs for medical practices, Nelly can handle invoices and billing. This part can save significant time for medical practices, as it can lead to spending less time chasing out-of-pocket payments.\n\nNelly can also be used as an alternative to a corporate bank account with an expense management system and corporate credit cards. Finally, Nelly offers factoring for instant payouts of outstanding claims.\n\nThese strong integrations in the patient journey and into the medical practice\u2019s back-office system create a barrier to entry for other fintech companies. Nelly has also gone through data protection certifications as well. \u201cWe are the first company that sent digital invoices in the medical space in Germany,\u201d Radner said.\n\nThe product is currently available in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. It recently expanded to Italy, and there are more countries coming down the road.\n\n\u201cNelly works with the largest DSOs [dental service organizations] in Europe \u2026 And we won the deal for the Colosseum Dental Group, which operates in 11 European countries. And they want to scale to their 700 locations with Nelly,\u201d Radner said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to expand with our customers to more markets in Europe.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "These days, nothing is certain about the tech market or the world at large. Even Nvidia\u2019s seemingly bulletproof stock took a hammering on Monday, enduring a $589 billion market cap decline after China-based DeepSeek raised questions for investors about more efficient AI models.\n\nBut Apple\u2019s stock has remained steady ahead of its first-quarter earnings report, which is set for after Thursday\u2019s closing bell. Though it took a slight hit as DeepSeek became the talk of the tech world, Apple\u2019s shares almost immediately rebounded by 7%. That could owe to the perception that the company trails rivals like Google and Microsoft in AI investments. The company\u2019s fortunes aren\u2019t tied quite so closely to generative AI\u2019s successes and failures.\n\nCertainly, its new tentpole technologies have underperformed, especially Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s own in-house generative AI offering, introduced last summer. The small model approach stands in marked contrast to plays from OpenAI and Google. Conventional wisdom in the space holds that bigger is better. As such, many of the best-known models are trained on every piece of information developers can get their hands on, regardless of whether or not it might have a direct impact on user queries.\n\nHowever, the massive black box approach makes it difficult \u2014 or impossible \u2014 to determine why a particular dataset is prone to hallucinations, and it\u2019s easy to have an insufficient model, owing to a too-small dataset. As the recent rollback of Apple Intelligence news summaries proves, simply taking a hyper-focused approach to model training isn\u2019t a magic bullet.\n\nIn Apple\u2019s case, iOS 18 provided inaccurate summaries of news app alerts. (The news industry is already in enough trouble, without an added layer of misinformation.) Apple did the right thing by pausing the feature to return to the drawing board. But day one issues can shake investor confidence when a feature is an essential piece of a company\u2019s future strategy.\n\nThose challenges come at a tricky time for Apple. Over the holidays, Apple saw an 18% iPhone sales drop in China, owing to growing competition from homegrown brands like Oppo, Vivo, Honor, and Xiaomi. After being sidelined by restrictions handed down from the first Trump administration, Huawei has seen its own massive rebound in China as development continues on its in-house HarmonyOS.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Apple\u2019s Vision Pro \u2014 which relies on AI and machine learning models to enable room mapping, among other features \u2014 has also underperformed from a sales perspective.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: If the AI category proves to be the bubble many analysts expect, Apple\u2019s diverse portfolio should bolster the company\u2019s fortunes. As much of that portfolio is tied to the company\u2019s hardware ecosystem, a key piece of Apple\u2019s small model approach is a desire to execute as much as possible on-device.\n\nApple has also invested a lot in servers designed to handle AI computations remotely in the form of the Private Cloud Compute service that launched alongside Apple Intelligence. This is an important short-term solution, at the very least. Meanwhile, DeepSeek\u2019s approach \u2014 it released \u201cdistilled\u201d versions of its R1 AI model, including one small enough to run on a laptop \u2014 lent credence to a future in which accurate generative AI models are run locally on personal consumer electronics. This would be a big win for the iPhone maker.\n\nThe immediate question for shareholders listening to Thursday\u2019s call will be what\u2019s around the corner for Apple.\n\nTrailing other companies with regard to generative AI development has led Apple to explore partnerships. At WWDC in June, it announced a deal with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into the platform. The company has also kept itself open to future partnerships, even letting slip its plans to eventually partner with Google\u2019s Gemini.\n\nIt stands to reason that any generative AI platform would happily partner with a brand of Apple\u2019s stature, but it\u2019s way too early to say what that could mean for some future DeepSeek/Apple partnership. DeepSeek\u2019s U.S. ambitions are tied to U.S./China relations and it\u2019s entirely unclear how that will play out in the coming months and years.\n\nPresident Trump raised alarm about DeepSeek shortly after its debut, telling the media, \u201cThe release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser focused on competing.\u201d The White House has also been exploring what DeepSeek could mean for national security.\n\nThere is much speculation around what the current administration will mean to Apple\u2019s own China ambitions, though Apple isn\u2019t sitting on its hands. In spite of past culture clashes CEO Tim Cook announced a $1 million personal donation to the then-president-elect\u2019s inaugural committee. The move came as fellow tech CEOs embraced the reelection of a president Wall Street considers to be exceptionally business-friendly.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the administration\u2019s historically adversarial relationship with big tech, which Vice President JD Vance recently described as having \u201ctoo much power.\u201d\n\nApple navigated the week\u2019s volatility better than others. But when it reports first-quarter earnings after the bell Thursday, Apple needs to lay out a cohesive strategy for AI, iPhone sales in China, and what the future looks like broadly under the new administration. For the first time in a long time, that future is uncertain.",

    "raw_text": "Bench, the accounting startup that imploded over the holidays, filed for bankruptcy in Canada on January 7 revealing massive debts, documents seen by TechCrunch show.\n\nThe filings \u2014 one for Bench and another for 10Sheet, Bench\u2019s original name \u2014 show that Bench had $2.8 million in cash on hand by the end of its life but $65.4 million in liabilities. (TechCrunch converted the bankruptcy filing data from Canadian to U.S. dollars at a rate of $1 USD to $1.44 CAD.) Founded in 2012, Bench had raised $113 million from investors like Shopify and Bain Capital Ventures.\n\nMost of Bench\u2019s debt \u2014 $50 million \u2014 is owed to the National Bank of Canada, one of Canada\u2019s largest commercial banks. More than 85% of that debt is unsecured, meaning the bank has little collateral to claim against the loan now that Bench has defaulted. That debt may have helped prompt Bench\u2019s sudden shutdown: Tech publication Newcomer reported that NBC declined to make concessions to Bench as it was being shopped around for sale. NBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe bankruptcy filings also reveal financial obligations to Bench\u2019s VC investors, split between convertible notes (which are meant to convert to equity) and direct shareholder loans. Bench owes $1.3 million to Bain Capital Ventures, whose partner Sarah Hinkfuss was appointed to Bench\u2019s board in 2023, according to a press release. Bench owes another $1.2 million to Canadian VC Inovia Capital, whose executive-in-residence Adam Schlesinger was appointed as Bench\u2019s last CEO, the filings show. Contour Venture Partners, a New York-based VC which led Bench\u2019s $60 million Series C round, is owed about $750,000. California-based Altos Ventures, another investor, is owed $777,000. All of this VC-related debt is unsecured, the filings state.\n\nBench\u2019s other debts include $1.8 million in severance pay to former employees, the documents say. TechCrunch previously reported that Bench\u2019s staff were suddenly let go on December 27 with no notice or severance provided. (Bench\u2019s new owner, Employer.com, says it has re-hired a large number of staff, but told TechCrunch they are temporarily on 30-day contracts as Bench sorts out its issues.)\n\nBench owes tens of thousands of dollars in severance pay to former executives too: CEO Jean-Philippe Durrios, CRO Todd Daum, and CFO Mor Lakritz are all listed in the filings. Lakritz\u2019s LinkedIn indicates Bench had about $50 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nFinally, the bankruptcy filings show Bench owes $4 million in unpaid rent to Canadian real estate agency Morguard, most likely for its office. At its peak, Bench employed over 600 people. Beyond the money owed to employees, office space and about $1.5 million (by our back-of-envelope math) due to a scattering of expected creditors, like SaaS business software providers, the filings don\u2019t show how the rest of the money was spent.\n\nAs Bench works its way through bankruptcy, it is also in the process of being acquired by San Francisco-based HR tech company Employer.com. Although its customers have also told TechCrunch that Employer.com is requiring them to turn their data over to Employer, or risk losing it.\n\nGary Levin, head of corporate development for Employer.com, told TechCrunch that the Canadian court is overseeing Bench\u2019s insolvency proceedings and will supervise the distribution of proceeds to creditors. He emphasized that Employer.com has a strong balance sheet that allows it to invest in Bench significantly moving forward.",

    "raw_text": "Savant Labs launched its automation platform for data analysts in 2023. The company, which competes with the likes of Alteryx, on Thursday said it had raised $18.5 million in a Series A round led by Dell Technologies Capital.\n\nUnlike some other low-code/no-code tools, Savant\u2019s focus is squarely on business analysts. Analysts, its CEO and founder Chitrang Shah says, tend to spend a lot of time in spreadsheets, so Savant has put what is essentially a spreadsheet at the core of its user experience. Its no-code graphical user interface is, in many ways, a representation of the workflows and automations the users set up in the spreadsheet.\n\nBefore founding Savant Labs, Shah worked at Lattice Engines on machine learning models. After Lattice was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 2019, he left in 2021 to start Savant Labs. The way he describes it, Savant Labs is essentially an extension of the work he did at Lattice.\n\n\u201cWe were building for business analysts back then, but our product [at Lattice Engines] was centered around sales and marketing use cases only,\u201d he said. \u201cWe realized there is a much bigger market beyond sales and marketing, especially in finance, supply chain, HR analytics. The core goes back to this theme I\u2019ve always noticed: There is a big disconnect between supply and demand of analytics. The demand continues to grow with more SaaS apps being deployed, more data being generated. Everybody needs to analyze data.\u201d\n\nMany tools on the market focus on data engineers, Shah argued, and they are the ones typically in charge of automating analytics solutions. But since there are not enough data engineers to go around, analysts are often bottlenecked. That\u2019s a market Alteryx and others pioneered almost two decades ago now, but Shah believes that innovation at these companies has stalled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we saw the opening,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a like take the baton and carry it forward to the next generation, if you will. We couldn\u2019t have timed it better ourselves. Their customers are looking for alternatives, but also, the technology that is available is evolving rapidly. Especially with AI, we can do things that simply weren\u2019t possible years ago.\u201d\n\nDell Technologies Capital partner Radhika Malik echoed this. \u201cAn enterprise being able to harness the power of its data is no longer a competitive advantage \u2014 it\u2019s a business imperative. Legacy tools aren\u2019t rising to the occasion, but fortunately, Chitrang and the team at Savant are,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat impressed us and led to our investment was their deep technical experience in evolving analytics tools and their clear vision of how AI will transform the experience for the end user analyst and the enterprise as a whole.\u201d\n\nToday, Savant\u2019s users can use standard Excel formulas to create, transform, and manipulate their data, and they can also ask the service\u2019s bot to write formulas for them.\n\nLike virtually all similar services, Savant can connect to data sources ranging from basic spreadsheets in SharePoint to data warehouses, databases, and SaaS apps. It also provides centralized tools for managing how data can be accessed as well as standard role-based access controls and other security features.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Savant Labs isn\u2019t trying to go up against other data pipeline companies. Indeed, Shah argues that its approach is quite different, in part because of its interface. \u201cWe have an interface where you can drag and drop these tools and build your data workflow if you want,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we make it easy by just letting [analysts] work in a spreadsheet interface and [the graphical representation] is an output on the back-end. That\u2019s the major innovation.\u201d\n\nThe company is mostly going after larger businesses with more than 1,000 employees at this point. Shah says quite a few Fortune 500 companies are already using its service in industries like healthcare, energy, and insurance. Over time, the company also plans to go after small and medium businesses.\n\n\u201cMy main thesis is that analytics can\u2019t just be locked down with technical users,\u201d Shah said. \u201cWe need to make it available to a broader set of users, but in a way that allows central teams to have governance and oversight. Governance and collaboration is a big gap, and that\u2019s something we are very excited about solving.\u201d\n\nVertex Ventures, Cota Capital, Village Global, Bloomberg Beta, West Wave Capital, and Uncorrelated Ventures also participated in this round. The company has raised a total of $29.5 million so far.",

    "raw_text": "Barcelona-based business travel management platform TravelPerk has raised $200 million at a hefty $2.7 billion valuation \u2014 almost double the $1.4 billion valuation at its previous fundraise last year.\n\nAlongside the raise, TravelPerk also announced it has acquired Swiss startup Yokoy to bring native expenses management into the fray.\n\nWith the travel and tourism industry just about back to pre-pandemic levels, this has proved a boon for startups offering everything from tour packages and trip-planning tools to luggage storage and vacation rental smarts.\n\nThis trend has been reflected somewhat in the corporate sphere, too, with the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) noting that business travel was on course to hit a record $1.5 trillion in 2024 \u2014 6.2% more than the pre-pandemic peak in 2019. This demand is filtering down into the corporate travel startup space, too, and investors are taking note. In September, news emerged that Denver-based Engine, which focuses on hotel bookings, flights, car rentals, and meeting spaces, had raised $140 million at a $2.1 billion valuation.\n\nTravelPerk, for its part, touts an all-in-one platform for businesses to book, manage, and report all their domestic and international travel, with integrations that extend the platform to functions such as HR and expenses.\n\nWhile the pandemic has had an indelible impact on working culture in terms of remote and hybrid working, there is little correlation between this and the kind of corporate travel that TravelPerk is concerned with. TravelPerk president and chief operating officer, Jean-Christophe Taunay-Bucalo, pointed to its recent Value of Business Travel Report, which found that companies are still planning to invest in travel to boost sales and new business efforts, such as by traveling to conferences.\n\n\u201cHybrid and remote working models have had a minimal impact on demand for business travel \u2014 those who are travelling for work will continue to do so, because it\u2019s part of their job,\u201d Taunay-Bucalo told TechCrunch over email. \u201cWhether it\u2019s for a sales meeting or to install a wind turbine, there are many situations where workers need to be on the ground and in person.\u201d\n\nHowever, a more distributed workforce does mean that companies are investing more in off-sites, which require travel. And TravelPerk sees this decentralization as a perfect opportunity to gets its technology into the hands of more people.\n\n\u201cDecentralised travel systems empower employees to manage their own bookings, and while in the past that meant a lack of control over expenses and compliance, tools built into our platform give control and visibility back to the business by providing oversight without burdening travel managers with logistical complexities,\u201d Taunay-Bucalo said.\n\n\u201cUnified travel and expense\u201d\n\nFounded in 2015, TravelPerk had previously raised around $660 million in equity and debt capital, and with another $200 million in the bank, the company said it\u2019s now doubling down on its global growth plans. This includes the U.S. market, where it acquired Chicago-based rival AmTrav last year with support from $135 million in debt financing.\n\nBut these growth efforts also include expanding into tangential verticals. Among TravelPerk\u2019s existing integrations is Yokoy, an AI-enabled spend management platform backed by Sequoia Capital. And as part of its Series E funding announcement Monday, TravelPerk said it\u2019s now acquiring Yokoy outright for an undisclosed sum \u2014 though TechCrunch is told that it was a \u201cnine figure\u201d transaction, which makes sense given that Yokoy had raised around $107 million since its inception in 2019.\n\nThis will allow TravelPerk to offer a \u201cdeeper and more unified travel and expense offering,\u201d with expenses baked natively into its core platform rather than relying exclusively on third-party integrations.\n\n\u201cOur focus has never been stronger as we expand across core markets, accelerate growth in the U.S., and now work to become the number one travel and expense management platform,\u201d TravelPerk co-founder and CEO Avi Meir (pictured above) said in a statement.\n\nThis mirrors moves elsewhere in the tech realm. For example, TripActions expanded into expenses management back in 2020 in response to a pandemic that put most companies\u2019 travel plans on long-term hiatus. Ramp, meanwhile, moved in the opposite direction in 2022, adding travel management to its existing expenses product.\n\nExpanding into expenses makes a great deal of sense, as it future-proofs against whatever headwinds the travel sector faces today and in the future. Indeed, expenses is something that all businesses have to deal with, regardless of their position on corporate travel.\n\nAs a result of the transaction, Yokoy\u2019s team, including CEO Philippe Sahli and CTO Devis Lussi, will join TravelPerk, where they will set about integrating their respective products.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Yokoy has already been a great success, and we are excited to take it to the next level by welcoming Phil, Devis, and the rest of the team to TravelPerk,\u201d Meir said. \u201cWe share a common vision for the role of AI reshaping the future of travel and expense management, and the innovation coming out of Yokoy\u2019s AI labs in Zurich is seriously impressive.\u201d\n\nTravelPerk\u2019s Series E round was led by European venture capital firm Atomico, with participation from EQT Growth, Noteus Partners, Kinnevik, General Catalyst, among other existing investors.",

    "raw_text": "Web-based party games are making a comeback, now with the infusion of generative AI. Among the startups joining the trend, the current forecast looks good for one startup, Little Umbrella, which leverages AI for its social party games.\n\nThe company announced on Thursday its $2 million seed funding round. Little Umbrella plans to use the new capital to help expedite the launch of three AI-powered social games, set to be released in the coming year.\n\nSocial games are experiencing a resurgence, particularly within online communities like Discord. This genre is appealing to players and their friends because they are quick to play and primarily depend on group dynamics for enjoyment. Jackbox Games is a notable example; its core focus is on party video games that attract millions of players. In 2021 alone, players reportedly participated in over 72.2 million games.\n\nLittle Umbrella believes it can differentiate itself by using AI to develop games more rapidly than ever before. Additionally, because large language models (LLMs) can be unpredictable, employing them as game masters ensures that each round will be different and entertaining.\n\nThe startup\u2019s flagship title, Death by AI, quickly became a hit after its launch last year. Within the first three months, the game attracted over 20 million players. Its success is not surprising, as it features a hilarious premise: Players are challenged to create deadly scenarios and observe how they and their friends would react. Utilizing generative AI, the game evaluates whether a player succeeds or fails, allowing each player five attempts before they are eliminated.\n\nDeath by AI is available for free on Discord, the web, and iOS. It can be played by up to eight players.\n\nLittle Umbrella will soon launch its new party game, tentatively titled The Last Show by AI. The company describes it as a dystopian game show hosted by sinister AI game masters. In the game, players must survive while voting their friends out in the process. The company plans to launch a beta version during the 2025 Game Developers Conference in March.\n\nThere has been a significant rise in the use of generative AI tools in video game development. This technology enables developers to create ambitious games with minimal effort, reducing costs in the process. For instance, Little Umbrella claims that it was able to develop and launch Death by AI in just 10 weeks. In contrast, Jackbox Games releases its game packs on a nearly annual schedule.\n\nLittle Umbrella developed a cross-platform social game kit called Playroom to power Death by AI, along with its upcoming projects. This kit includes an AI orchestration layer that utilizes multiple custom models in partnership with ElevenLabs, Inworld, and OpenAI.\n\nPlayroom is currently available to all video game developers and costs between $10 and $150 per month, depending on the size of the team. There\u2019s also a free version.\n\nThe small gaming studio is led by Tabish Ahmed, who was formerly the design leader at Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds. Recognizing the opportunity to create social experiences on platforms like Discord, where friends already interact, Ahmed noted that cross-platform development poses significant challenges for studios, leading to a gap between demand and content availability.\n\n\u201cAt Little Umbrella, we\u2019ve embraced this challenge by creating platform-agnostic social games that are built and maintained at a fraction of the cost using AI, designed specifically for where players gather with their friends, bridging the gaps in both demand and scalability,\u201d Ahmed told TechCrunch.\n\nThe team also includes Timothy Johnson (CTO), who previously worked at Gallium Studios building AI-simulated worlds, and Sean Webster (CBO), former AppLovin vice president and head of partnerships at Snap. Additionally, Little Umbrella\u2019s art director, Bill Robison, has contributed his skills to popular titles like \u201cBoss Baby,\u201d \u201cScoob!,\u201d and \u201cYoung Jedi Adventures.\u201d\n\nInvestors who participated in the latest round include a16z speedrun, Breakpoint Ventures, Disrupt.com, GFR Fund, ubiQuoss Investment, Venture Reality Fund, and Workplay Ventures (Mark Pincus\u2019 VC firm), along with angel investors Matt Bilbey (former Electronic Arts exec) and Flexport founder Ryan Peterson.",

    "raw_text": "ICON Technologies Inc., which builds homes using 3D printing, is laying off 114 people, according to a WARN letter filed with the Texas Workforce Commission.\n\nA spokesperson for the company confirmed the news to TechCrunch, providing a statement that ICON had \u201crecently made a difficult decision to re-align\u201d its team and team size \u201cto focus on our highest priorities and continue to invest in our best growth opportunities.\u201d\n\nICON was founded in late 2017 and launched during SXSW in March 2018 with the first permitted 3D-printed home in the U.S. That 350-square-foot house took about 48 hours (at 25% speed) to print.\n\nOver the years, Austin-based ICON has raised over $450 million in funding from investors such as Tiger Global Management, Norwest Venture Partners, 8VC, and others. At the time of its last raise in February of 2022 \u2014 a $185 million extension of a Series B round \u2014 ICON\u2019s valuation was said to be \u201capproaching $2 billion.\u201d\n\nIt is unknown just how many employees ICON will have after the layoffs take place, which according to the letter, will occur on March 8. The Austin Business Journal reported that ICON had about 400 employees \u201cat last count,\u201d so a layoff of 114 people would be more than 25% of its workforce. A spokesperson for the company said only that ICON had \u201cless than 400 employees\u201d prior to this workforce reduction.\n\nAt the time of its last raise, the startup said it had delivered more than two dozen 3D-printed homes and structures across the U.S. and Mexico. More than half of those homes were built for the homeless or those in chronic poverty. For example, in 2020, ICON delivered 3D-printed homes in Mexico with nonprofit partner New Story. It also completed a series of homes serving the chronically homeless in Austin, Texas, with nonprofit Mobile Loaves & Fishes.\n\nThe startup broke into the mainstream housing market in early 2021 with what it said were the first 3D-printed homes for sale in the U.S. for developer 3Strands in Austin, Texas.\n\nThen, in October 2021, ICON announced a partnership with Lennar, one of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders and an investor in the startup through its venture arm, LENx.\n\nAn ICON spokesperson on Thursday told TechCrunch the company\u2019s priority now is to accelerate the development of Phoenix, its line of multi-story 3D printers \u201cand begin putting the robotic technology into the hands of builders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile our mission remains to develop these intelligent machines to build humanity\u2019s future, we will continue to design and build a selection of key projects across residential, hospitality, social/affordable and those within the Department of Defense with a more streamlined team,\u201d the spokesperson added.",

    "raw_text": "The jury is still out on whether the Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek is a game changer or part of an elaborate plan by its hedge fund parent company to short Nvidia and other tech stocks. Whichever it might be (maybe both?), DeepSeek and its large language model have made some major waves. And now, it\u2019s catching the eye of data protection watchdogs.\n\nToday the Irish Data Protection Commission confirmed to TechCrunch that it has sent a note to DeepSeek requesting details concerning how the data of citizens in Ireland is processed by the company. \u201cThe Data Protection Commission (DPC) has written to DeepSeek requesting information on the data processing conducted in relation to data subjects in Ireland,\u201d said a spokesperson. They declined to answer further questions.\n\nThe letter from Ireland\u2019s DPA was sent less than 24 hours after the data protection watchdog in Italy sent a similar note to the company. DeepSeek has yet to respond to either request publicly. However, its mobile app no longer appears in both the Google and Apple app stores in Italy.\n\nThe Italian move appeared to be the first major move from one such watchdog since DeepSeek went positively viral in recent days; Euroconsumers, a coalition of consumer groups in Europe, has filed a complaint to the Italian Data Protection Authority related to how DeepSeek handles personal data in relation to GDPR, the data protection regulatory framework in Europe.\n\nThe Italian DPA confirmed today that it subsequently wrote to DeepSeek with a request for information. \u201cA rischio i dati di milioni di persone in Italia,\u201d it notes. (\u201cThe data of millions of Italians is at risk.\u201d) DeepSeek has 20 days to respond.\n\nTwo key details about DeepSeek that many noticed are that the service is made in and operates out of China. Per its privacy policy, this includes the information and data that DeepSeek collects and stores, which is also housed in its home country.\n\nDeepSeek also briefly notes in its policy that when it transfers data to China from the country where DeepSeek is being used, it does so \u201cin accordance with the requirements of applicable data protection laws.\u201d\n\nBut Euroconsumers \u2014 the organization that brought a successful case against Grok last year over how it used data to train its AI \u2014 and the Italian DPA want more detail.\n\nAddressing Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence and Beijing DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence, the Italian DPA said it wants to know what personal data is collected, from which sources, and for which purposes \u2014 including what information is used to train its AI system \u2014 along with what the legal basis is for processing. It also wants more details on those servers in China.\n\nFurther, it writes in its information request, it wants to know \u201cin the event that personal data is collected through web scraping activities,\u201d how users who are \u201cregistered and those not registered to the service have been or are informed about the processing of their data.\u201d\n\nThe news outlet MLex notes that Euroconsumers also highlighted that there are no details regarding how DeepSeek protects or restricts minors on its services, from age verification to how it handles minors\u2019 data.\n\n(DeepSeek\u2019s age policy notes that it is not intended for users under the age of 18, although it does not provide a way to enforce that. For those between the ages of 14 and 18, DeepSeek suggests these younger users read through the privacy policy with an adult.)\n\nEuroconsumers and the Italian watchdog represent the first effort to make a move against DeepSeek. They might not be the last, although follow-ups may not be as swift.\n\nEarlier today, DeepSeek was a prime topic at a press conference at the European Commission. Thomas Regnier, Commission spokesperson for Tech Sovereignty, was asked whether there are concerns at the European level over DeepSeek related to security, privacy, and censorship. For now, though, the main message appeared to be: It\u2019s too soon to say anything about any investigations.\n\n\u201cThe services offered in Europe will respect our rules,\u201d Regnier noted in a response to a question about data privacy, adding that the AI Act applies to all AI services offered in the region.\n\nHe declined to say whether DeepSeek, in the EU\u2019s estimation, respected those rules or not. He was then asked whether the app\u2019s censorship on topics that are politically sensitive in China fell afoul of free speech rules in Europe and if that merited an investigation. \u201cThese are very early stages, I\u2019m not talking about an investigation yet,\u201d Regnier said quickly in response. \u201cOur framework is solid enough to tackle potential issues if they are here.\u201d\n\nQuestions TechCrunch sent to the ICO in the U.K. about DeepSeek received a similar response: DeepSeek, in effect, will be subject to the same scrutiny as any other GenAI developer. But no further actions yet.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI developers and deployers need to make sure people have meaningful, concise, and easily accessible information about the use of their personal data and have clear and effective processes for enabling people to exercise their information rights,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe will continue to engage with stakeholders on promoting effective transparency measures, without shying away from taking action when our regulatory expectations are ignored.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, could new avenues of regulatory questioning open around areas like copyright and IP protection?\n\nMany have marveled at how DeepSeek\u2019s very existence seems to challenge assumptions about the actual costs of training and operating an LLM or a generative AI service: Its cheaper infrastructure and cost base undermine the idea that building foundational AI and running generative AI applications have to cost a fortune in chips, data center usage, and energy consumption.\n\nBut more recently, some have started to raise questions about all that. Microsoft and OpenAI say that there appears to be evidence that it was partly trained on \u201cdistillations\u201d from their proprietary models. There would be an uncanny irony in this if it proves to be true \u2014 given the many legal and other dramas that have swirled around how some LLM builders have allegedly regarded intellectual property and copyright.\n\nWe have contacted DeepSeek regarding the Italian DPA complaint and will update this post as more information becomes available. In the meantime, DeepSeek\u2019s apps have now been pulled from the major Italian app stores, although it appears to still be live online in the country.\n\nUpdated with further detail on regulatory responses, legal issues, and status of the service in Italy.",

    "raw_text": "With its 700,000 customers, Alan could be considered as a mature company. But the health insurance company that wants to become a digital companion for your health is still growing like a startup.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company shared some financial metrics. The most impressive one is its top-line revenue. In 2024, the company generated \u20ac505 million in revenue (around $525 at today\u2019s exchange rate).\n\nBut comparing Alan to a normal tech startup can be difficult as the startup is an insurance company. It offers a health insurance product that complements the national healthcare system in France, Spain, Belgium, and soon Canada.\n\n\u201cThe model remains the same: We aim for a breakeven claims-to-premiums ratio, with a membership fee of 12% to 14%,\u201d Alan\u2019s co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve said at a press conference. In other words, the vast majority of Alan\u2019s revenue could be considered as insurance premiums, with Alan taking a 12 to 14% cut for additional services and management fees.\n\nIf you want to compare Alan with a software-as-a-service company, a little back-of-the-envelope calculation would rank Alan as a startup with \u20ac60 million to \u20ac70 million in annual recurring revenue ($62 million to $73 million).\n\nHowever, the startup \u2014 valued at $4.5 billion \u2014 is still losing money. In 2024, Alan registered a net loss of \u20ac54 million compared to \u20ac59 million in 2023 ($56 million and $61 million, respectively).\n\n\u201cWe confirm the objective we announced last year of achieving profitability by 2026,\u201d Alan\u2019s chief financial officer Mihaela Albu said.\n\nWhile the company isn\u2019t turning a profit just yet, the good news is that its distribution strategy is scaling well. The Alan team only grew by 8% in 2024 and the sales team is more or less stable.\n\nIn France, the company won tenders for government workers. In Belgium, it signed a strategy partnership with Belfius, the second biggest bank and insurance company of the country. Belfius is now an investor in Alan and is going to distribute Alan\u2019s products to its own customers.\n\nDisrupting the health insurance market with AI\n\nJust like last year, artificial intelligence came up quite often during the press conference. Ludovic Baupl\u00e9, Alan\u2019s chief revenue officer, said that the sales team has increased its results by around 50% thanks to the use of artificial intelligence in the sales process.\n\n\u201cOperationally, we\u2019ve been able to cut customer service costs. On the product side, we\u2019ve accelerated our code production and the way we do unit tests,\u201d Samuelian-Werve said. \u201cIn marketing, it\u2019s actually quite amazing how much we\u2019ve accelerated the production of assets and videos, reducing costs while dramatically increasing quality and performance.\u201d\n\nUp next, Alan plans to grow total revenue by another 40% in 2025 compared to 2024. The company should reach 1 million end customers by early 2026. And, of course, there will be more automations, with 40% of customer support requests that should be handled without any manual input by the end of the year.\n\nThe company also used Wednesday\u2019s press conference as an opportunity to announce its health insurance offers for retired people in France. According to the company, there are 750,000 new retirees in France every year. So this will help when it comes to growth.",

Behind those trades \u2014 which earned SoftBank the \u201cNasdaq whale\u201d moniker \u2014 was Akshay Naheta, an executive whose career has been marked by bold wagers on disruption.\n\nNow, after orchestrating multi-billion-dollar deals, including an attempt to merge Nvidia and ARM, Naheta is making perhaps his most ambitious bet yet: That the world\u2019s payment infrastructure is ripe for reinvention.\n\nHis Zug, Switzerland-based startup, Distributed Technologies Research (DTR), is attempting to bridge the gap between traditional banking and blockchain technology, joining an army of companies trying to modernize the global payments infrastructure.\n\nThe startup claims its technology can eliminate various payment inefficiencies, from transfer costs and interchange fees to foreign exchange conversion charges and settlement delays. \u201cCurrent payment networks suffer from inefficiencies \u2014 transfer costs, interchange fees, FX conversion charges, settlement delays and other opaque fees,\u201d Naheta told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\nDTR\u2019s core technology, AmalgamOS, essentially connects banks with blockchain networks. Through APIs, it allows businesses to integrate payment capabilities while maintaining compliance with local regulations. The system can handle everything from merchant payments to treasury management, supporting both traditional currencies and major stablecoins across 48 countries.\n\nThe startup has built what Naheta describes as an \u201cinternational orchestration network\u201d that automatically routes transactions through either traditional banking or blockchain rails, depending on which path offers the optimal combination of speed and cost. \u201cWe\u2019re connected to 12,000 banks in Europe,\u201d he said in an interview. A business integrating DTR\u2019s APIs can let its customers initiate transfers directly through banking apps.\n\nDTR\u2019s push into payments infrastructure comes at a seemingly opportune time. Visa and Mastercard \u2014 both of which charge 2% to 3% swipe fees, typically the second highest cost for merchants after payroll \u2014 are facing mounting scrutiny over their duopoly, and the U.S.\u2019 proposed Credit Card Competition Act could require banks to offer merchants alternatives to the dominant networks.\n\nDTR\u2019s early customers say its infrastructure fills a significant gap. Phillip Lord of Oobit, a crypto wallet startup, said the system allowed his company to move money from his crypto wallet to a U.K. bank account on Christmas Day in under 30 seconds \u2014 a transfer that would have taken days through traditional channels.\n\nNaheta\u2019s interest in payment infrastructure stems from an unlikely source: SoftBank\u2019s acquisition of Fortress Investment Group in 2017. The deal put about $20 million worth of Bitcoin on SoftBank\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nAs he studied the underlying blockchain technology, Naheta says he saw an opportunity to apply his background in wireless communications to payment networks. While still at SoftBank, Naheta had begun assembling what he hoped would be DTR\u2019s founding team. He reached out to his undergraduate thesis adviser, Pramod Viswanath, an expert in wireless communications who now leads Princeton\u2019s blockchain center and Sreeram Kannan, who would later start EigenLayer.\n\nThe team saw blockchain as a peer-to-peer communications network at heart, one that could apply decades of research in wireless systems to revolutionize payments. Naheta said he nearly resigned from SoftBank in summer 2018 to focus on DTR and crypto venture Bakkt, but was persuaded to stay by senior executives, including Rajeev Misra and Masayoshi Son.\n\nNaheta\u2019s previous forays into the payments sector also included SoftBank\u2019s investment in Wirecard, which later collapsed. SoftBank still made profits on its investment in Wirecard. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of missteps,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cI looked at it from a perspective of, here\u2019s a company that has all of these regulated licenses around the world, clearly has the payments technology.\u201d\n\nThose experiences appear to have influenced DTR\u2019s emphasis on compliance and institutional credibility. This measured approach extends to the company\u2019s growth strategy. \u201cEven if I increase my headcount to 60 people by the second quarter, we\u2019ll be free-cash-flow positive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe startup faces competition on multiple fronts. Wise has built a successful business matching currency flows between countries, Ripple offers blockchain-based settlement despite its legal troubles, while traditional banks also say they are upgrading their systems through initiatives like SWIFT. Last, but not least, Stripe\u2019s recent $1 billion acquisition of Bridge stands to help the world\u2019s most valuable fintech startup make deeper inroads into payments.\n\nYet Naheta sees an opening in serving businesses caught between these worlds \u2014 particularly digital nomads, creator economy platforms, and companies operating across emerging markets.\n\n\u201cBanks are not equipped to run KYC/AML at that small level, where you\u2019re paying out $200 to 10,000 people per month,\u201d he argued. The fragmented nature of national payment systems creates particular challenges for businesses operating globally, as each jurisdiction maintains its own rails and regulations.\n\nThe payments industry\u2019s high margins and network effects make it notoriously difficult to disrupt. PayPal commands a $70 billion market cap even after recent declines, while Visa and Mastercard together are worth over $1 tillion.\n\n\u201cI really think that the retail customer is getting screwed on payments,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not the fault of the banks. They are plugged into legacy systems and it\u2019s very hard to turn a Titanic.\u201d\n\nLord of Oobit said in an interview that the space remains wide open. He pointed out that until just a year ago, the only option for businesses needing to move between crypto and traditional banking systems was to \u201cgo to like an OTC shop and pay probably like 1 to 3% to get it transferred.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy that for so many years, we have had so many startups come up, we have had so many coins show up, and whenever I wanted to do an on-ramp or off-ramp, there was no other formalized legal idea system around,\u201d he said. DTR\u2019s solution is \u201ca block faster\u201d than alternatives.",

    "raw_text": "OpenAI disbanded its robotics department. Then, it brought it back. Now, through a social media post from its hardware director and newly published job descriptions, OpenAI is revealing more about its plans for the revived team.\n\nIn a post on X on Friday, Caitlin Kalinowski, who joined OpenAI to lead hardware last November from Meta\u2019s AR glasses division, said that OpenAI will develop its own robots \u2014 complete with a custom sensor suite.\n\nIn the post, Kalinowski spotlighted new OpenAI robotics job listings with additional info.\n\nPer the listings, OpenAI\u2019s robotics team will focus on \u201cgeneral-purpose,\u201d \u201cadaptive,\u201d and \u201cversatile\u201d robots that can operate with human-like intelligence in \u201cdynamic,\u201d \u201creal-world\u201d settings. OpenAI plans to create new sensors and computational elements for its robotics, which will be powered by AI models that the company develops internally.\n\n\u201cWorking across the entire model stack, we integrate cutting-edge hardware and software to explore a broad range of robotic form factors,\u201d reads one of the listings. \u201cWe strive to seamlessly blend high-level AI capabilities with the physical constraints of physical robotic platforms.\u201d\n\nOne of the listings implies that OpenAI intends to employ contract workers to test its robotic prototypes. Another suggests that the company\u2019s robots might have limbs.\n\nThe Information recently reported that OpenAI has explored building its own humanoid robot.\n\nWhatever form they end up taking, OpenAI\u2019s robots will \u2014 if all goes according to plan \u2014 reach \u201cfull-scale production\u201d someday, one description reads. OpenAI appears to be bullish on the effort. In another listing, the company says it is seeking an engineer with \u201cexperience designing mechanical systems intended for high volume (1M+).\u201d\n\nRobotics is a hot commodity. The sector raised over $6.4 billion from VCs last year, according to Crunchbase, illustrating the interest in a technology with potentially endless applications.\n\nCompanies like Bright Machines and Collaborative Robotics, which develop software and systems for factory manufacturing, appear to have successfully found a niche. So have firms like Carbon Robotics, which is creating an AI-enabled weeding robot, and Bear Robotics, which makes a mobile robot capable of carrying trays and packages.\n\nHumanoid robots have attracted the most publicity, however.\n\nX1 and Figure, both of which have OpenAI backing, are attempting to create general-purpose robots that move more or less like humans. The challenges are formidable, but these companies claim that technology has reached the point where mass-produced humanoid robotic systems are a realistic near-term goal.\n\nThe many disappointments in recent robotics history suggest that will be easier said than achieved.\n\nRobots aren\u2019t the only hardware project OpenAI is actively working on. Legendary ex-Apple product designer Jony Ive confirmed last year that he is collaborating with OpenAI on a new device, and OpenAI is said to be designing a custom chip for running its AI models.",

    "raw_text": "Password managers have become commonplace at this point. But businesses often have different needs than consumers. Teams, after all, often have to share credentials to access resources, all while IT and security teams need ways to control who has access to them. Passbolt, which is announcing an $8 million seed round Thursday, aims to become the de facto password manager for small and midsize businesses, with ambitions to serve enterprise customers in the long run.\n\nThe Passbolt team, led by its France-born CEO Kevin Muller, argues that most organizations are not served well by what he argues are more consumer-oriented tools like Bitwarden or 1Password. \u201cYou look at Bitwarden, for example, or even 1Password, what they are doing is they have, at one end, a simple password management for the workforce, and then they built a secret manager \u2014 or they purchased a secret manager \u2014 for the DevOps teams, and then they build something else for authentication,\u201d Muller said. \u201cSo it\u2019s quite fragmented. And one of the problems is that these tools, most of the time, cannot talk to each other. They are very much standalone.\u201d\n\nMuller previously founded e-learning platform Click on French and ran a web development consultancy in India. He founded Passbolt in 2017, together with Remy Bertot and C\u00e9dric Alfonsi, after previously prototyping the open source community edition for a few years.\n\nThe service is based, in part, on KeePass, the popular open source password manager, but as Muller stressed, KeePass was never built for them. KeePass itself is already widely popular with technical teams, but it essentially creates a single static file where credentials are securely stored, he noted. This can easily be shared among team members, but because of that, there is no way to easily control who has access to it and there is no way to audit access (or revoke it), among other things.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted was more collaboration, more security, and more control,\u201d Muller said. \u201cWith control I mean: How do we install it behind our firewall on a server that we manage? How do we have it interoperable? How do we share passwords, secrets, and all types of credentials granularly?\u201d\n\nOver the course of the last few years, the team added features like native desktop apps, password expiry and rotations, a tool for getting two-factor authentication codes, and role-based access controls for using Passbolt\u2019s own user interface. One of the next features on the horizon is support for managing passkeys.\n\nIn the long run, the Passbolt team would also like to challenge the more enterprise-centric Privileged Access Management (PAM) services like CyberArk, Muller told me.\n\nToday, Passbolt offers a free community edition that users can self-host, as well as a self-hosted Pro edition ($49/month for 10 seats) with additional features like LDAP provisioning, single-sign-on support, activity logs, and more. Like so many other open source projects, Passbolt also offers a hosted solution (starting at $54 per month for 10 seats).\n\nAbout 38,000 teams use the free version, with 2,000 paying for Passbolt\u2019s services. The majority of users (75%) opt to self-host.\n\nAs Muller stressed, the code is regularly audited, and Passbolt is SOC2 Type II certified.\n\nPassbolt, which is based in Luxembourg and currently has about 30 employees, actually reached profitability in the summer of 2024. But the team still decided to raise in order to capitalize on the current growth and to keep up with feature requests from its users.\n\nThe company\u2019s Series A round was led by Netherlands-based Airbridge Equity Partners. Existing investors Expon Capital\u2019s Digital Tech Fund, ScaleFund, Seeder, Dedicated, Bondi Capital, Carricha Capital, and LBAN also participated, along with angel investors like Christophe Bianco (co-founder of Excellium Services) and Xavier Buck (co-founder of Datacenter Luxembourg).\n\n\u201cLegacy password managers like KeePass or Bitwarden and Privileged Access Management solutions such as CyberArk fall short for today\u2019s cross-functional, distributed and agile teams,\u201d said Rick van Boekel, managing partner at Airbridge Equity Partners. \u201cPassbolt\u2019s organic traction across various industries confirms the demand for a more collaborative, enterprise-grade solution, and their impressive SaaS metrics prove that Passbolt users are delighted with the solution offered.\u201d",

This marks a 274% increase from 2023 (the app launched in May of that year). Among tens of thousands of competitor apps \u2014 some of which license OpenAI\u2019s own technology \u2014 ChatGPT is so dominant that it has consistently earned more than the aggregate revenue of other top AI assistant apps.\n\nThe success of these apps is also a boon for Apple and Google, which retain about 30% of revenue from in-app purchases. Overall, mobile AI apps constitute a $2 billion market, according to Appfigures.\n\nChatGPT has been downloaded 353 million times to date, but the demographics that use the app are skewed. Over half of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile users are under age 25, indicating that perhaps young people are more open to experimenting with new technology (or, maybe, these users just want help with their homework \u2014 the Pew Research Center estimates that a quarter of U.S. teens have used ChatGPT for schoolwork, which has doubled from 2023).\n\nHowever, users between ages 50 and 64 make up the second largest age demographic, with 20.2% of users.\n\nThe gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nThough women hold prominent roles in the AI industry, a Pew report from 2022 indicates that women tend to be more skeptical about AI than men; an Axios poll found that 53% of women surveyed would not allow their children to use AI at all, as opposed to 26% of men. Meanwhile, McKinsey estimates that women will be more likely to lose their jobs to automation than their male counterparts, which could drive further resistance.\n\nWomen might also be less enthusiastic about the mass adoption of consumer AI products because they are particularly vulnerable to the most sinister impacts of this technology, like sexually explicit deepfake images.",

    "raw_text": "U.S. authorities have indicted five people over their alleged involvement in a multi-year North Korean IT worker scheme that saw them obtain remote employment with dozens of American companies.\n\nThe Department of Justice on Thursday announced the indictment of North Korean citizens Jin Sung-Il and Pak Jin-Song; Pedro Ernesto Alonso De Los Reyes of Mexico, and U.S. nationals Erick Ntekereze Prince and Emanuel Ashtor.\n\nThe DOJ said the FBI arrested Ntekereze and Ashtor, and a search of Ashtor\u2019s home in North Carolina found evidence of a \u201claptop farm\u201d that hosted company-provided laptops to deceive organizations into thinking they had hired workers based in the U.S.\n\nAlonso was also arrested in the Netherlands after a U.S. warrant was issued.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Ntekereze and Ashtor allegedly installed remote access software, including AnyDesk and TeamViewer, on the company-provided devices, allowing the North Koreans to conceal their locations. The two Americans also provided Jin and Pak with forged identity documents, including U.S. passports and U.S. bank accounts.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the defendants gained employment from at least 64 American organizations over the course of the multi-year scheme, which ran from April 2018 through August 2024. These included a U.S. financial institution, a San Francisco-based technology company, and a Palo Alto-headquartered IT organization.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, payments from ten of those companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue, most of which was laundered through a Chinese bank account.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice remains committed to disrupting North Korea\u2019s cyber-enabled sanctions-evading schemes, which seek to trick U.S. companies into funding the North Korean regime\u2019s priorities, including its weapons programs,\u201d Devin DeBacker, supervisory official with the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, said in a statement.\n\nAlongside Thursday\u2019s indictments, which come just days after the Treasury Department sanctioned two individuals and four entities for allegedly engaging in similar behavior, the FBI released an advisory warning that North Korean IT workers are increasingly engaging in malicious activity, including data extortion.\n\nThe agency said it has observed North Korean IT workers leveraging unlawful access to company networks to \u201cexfiltrate proprietary and sensitive data, facilitate cyber-criminal activities, and conduct revenue-generating activity on behalf of the regime.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "Move over, DeepSeek. There\u2019s a new AI champion in town \u2014 and they\u2019re American.\n\nOn Thursday, Ai2, a nonprofit AI research institute based in Seattle, released a model that it claims outperforms DeepSeek V3, one of Chinese AI company DeepSeek\u2019s leading systems.\n\nAi2\u2019s model, called Tulu 3 405B, also beats OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o on certain AI benchmarks, according to Ai2\u2019s internal testing. Moreover, unlike GPT-4o (and even DeepSeek V3), Tulu 3 405B is open source, which means all of the components necessary to replicate it from scratch are freely available and permissively licensed.\n\nA spokesperson for Ai2 told TechCrunch that the lab believes Tulu 3 405B \u201cunderscores the U.S.\u2019 potential to lead the global development of best-in-class generative AI models.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis milestone is a key moment for the future of open AI, reinforcing the U.S.\u2019 position as a leader in competitive, open source models,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWith this launch, Ai2 is introducing a powerful, U.S.-developed alternative to DeepSeek\u2019s models \u2014 marking a pivotal moment not just in AI development, but in showcasing that the U.S. can lead with competitive, open source AI independent of the tech giants.\u201d\n\nTulu 3 405B is a rather large model. Containing 405 billion parameters, it required 256 GPUs running in parallel to train, according to Ai2. Parameters roughly correspond to a model\u2019s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.\n\nAccording to Ai2, one of the keys to attaining competitive performance with Tulu 3 405B was a technique called reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, or RLVR, trains models on tasks with \u201cverifiable\u201d outcomes, like math problem solving and following instructions.\n\nAi2 claims that on the benchmark PopQA, a set of 14,000 specialized knowledge questions sourced from Wikipedia, Tulu 3 405B beat not only DeepSeek V3 and GPT-4o, but also Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 405B model. Tulu 3 405B also had the highest performance of any model in its class on GSM8K, a test containing grade school-level math word problems.\n\nTulu 3 405B is available to test via Ai2\u2019s chatbot web app, and the code to train the model is on GitHub and the AI dev platform Hugging Face. Get it while it\u2019s hot \u2014 and before the next benchmark-beating flagship AI model comes along.",

    "raw_text": "Lily Vittayarukskul (pictured above) was studying aerospace engineering when her aunt was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer. Her aunt had lived under the same roof as Vittayarukskul while she was growing up and helped raise her. \u201cWe went all in on her care,\u201d she recalled.\n\nPost-chemotherapy, Vittayarukskul\u2019s aunt \u201cbecame very frail,\u201d so her family \u2014 originally from Cambodia \u2014 navigated about two and half years of her daily long-term care needs. \u201cIt wiped us out financially,\u201d she told TechCrunch.\n\nThe emotional and financial impact was so traumatic that it prompted Vittayarukskul to pivot her studies to genetic and data science.\n\nIn December 2021, she founded Waterlily, a San Francisco startup aimed at helping individuals and advisors navigate long-term care options by modeling costs and funding strategies. Its goal, according to Vittayarukskul, is to make it easier for financial advisors and insurance agents \u201cto recommend the right financial products based on a family\u2019s predicted long-term care needs.\u201d\n\nExplained Vittayarukskul, \u201cUsually individuals start to think about long-term care when they\u2019re between the ages of 65 and 70, or just when they need it.\u201d But in many cases, that can be too late.\n\nWaterlily uses artificial intelligence to predict a family\u2019s future long-term care needs and costs and then guides them \u201cin building a care plan and figuring out the right way to pay for it,\u201d Vittayarukskul told TechCrunch. \u201cThat might mean buying life insurance with a long-term care rider, purchasing a dedicated LTC policy, using annuities, or simply self-funding.\u201d\n\nWaterlily\u2019s predictive AI can be used for any individual over 40.\n\nThe company pulls from more than 500 million data points and machine learning algorithms using its AI modeling software in an effort \u201cto make highly personalized care and cost predictions\u201d and forecast the \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d and \u201chow much\u201d of someone\u2019s potential long-term care needs.\n\n\u201cWe have formal data-sharing agreements with long-term care providers, government databases, academic research studies, and individual users\u201d \u2014 these include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019re finalizing similar contracts with insurance carriers to securely ingest their anonymized data,\u201d Vittayarukskul said.\n\nVittayarukskul initially started Waterlily as a solo founder until Evan Ehrenberg, a small angel investor, came along. Ehrenberg \u2014 who had previously founded and sold Clara Health \u2014 helped with early research and was struck by the industry\u2019s response. Curious, he tested the platform himself and was shocked by his long-term care predictions \u2014 so much so that he changed his diet, hired a personal trainer, and updated his financial plans.\n\nThat experience pulled him in deeper. He saw parallels between long-term care and issues he\u2019d encountered in clinical trials. Clara Health had helped tens of thousands of patients find trials, but he also saw how many turned to them not for cutting-edge treatments, but for generic copycats of existing drugs because insurance wouldn\u2019t cover the name-brand drugs they needed. Long-term care brought a similar realization \u2014 health insurance doesn\u2019t cover it, and many are unprepared for the financial burden, noted Vittayarukskul.\n\n\u201cAfter six months of working together, we knew it was a great fit and made him a co-founder,\u201d she said.\n\nEhrenberg\u2019s own backstory is interesting: After graduating from UC Berkeley at 16, he became MIT\u2019s youngest neuroscience PhD. Today, he also serves as Waterlily\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nStanding out in a complicated space\n\nOther tools exist that help with long-term planning, but Vittayarukskul believes they differ from Waterlily\u2019s more personalized offering. Genworth\u2019s cost of care calculator, for example, shows ZIP-code averages. NaviPlan, eMoney, MoneyGuidePro, and RightCapital are broader financial-planning platforms that include basic long-term care modules or cost calculators as one of their multiple functions.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWhile these tools help advisors model retirement and insurance scenarios, their LTC assumptions are typically driven by national averages or Monte Carlo simulations in order to stress-test financial planning by introducing noise into a basic default simulation.\u201d Waterlily, by contrast, \u201cblends deep predictive modeling with an easy-to-use platform.\u201d\n\nWaterlily only launched its platform publicly in March of 2024 so it doesn\u2019t have year-over-year metrics yet, but Vittayarukskul told TechCrunch the startup\u2019s monthly recurring revenue (MRR) today is greater than 22x what it was after its first month in the market. And, she said, its average month-over-month MRR growth since its launch has been 58%.\n\nThe company currently has eight \u201cmajor\u201d enterprise customers, including Prudential and \u201cseveral other Fortune 100 insurance carriers.\u201d There are also hundreds of independent financial advisors and insurance agents who use Waterlily, according to Vittayarukskul. Its revenue model is SaaS-based, with the company charging $250 per advisor or agent seat per month.\n\nAnd now the startup has raised $7 million in seed funding led by John Kim, founding partner of Brewer Lane Ventures, with strategic investments from Genworth, Nationwide, and Edward Jones. The startup previously raised a $2.2 million pre-seed round from investors including Scott Barclay, managing director of healthcare at Insight Partners.\n\nWaterlily plans to use its new capital, which was raised via a SAFE, to build out its engineering data science and enterprise management teams, as well as to continue strengthening its AI models and data partnerships. It also plans to increase its sales and marketing efforts.\n\nPresently, the startup has nine full-time employees in addition to contractors.\n\nLooking ahead, Waterlily is looking at disability, critical illness, hospital indemnity and Medicare planning, or \u201creally any area where advanced predictive modeling would help families make better life and health coverage decisions,\u201d Vittayarukskul said.\n\nThe company says it is also receiving interest from insurance carriers that want to use its data in underwriting. It potentially might expand internationally as well to Canada, the U.K., and parts of Asia.\n\nInvestor Kim, who is also former president of New York Life, told TechCrunch that he put money into Waterlily because he believes it is \u201cthe first AI-native guidance tool to assist in the single largest need as Americans age.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cLTC insurance is a large and growing need, and largely underserved by trusted advisors today. Waterlily\u2019s guidance tool has no comparable offering. It provides a customized and personalized recommendation for one\u2019s LTC needs. I believe it will be a game changer for the LTC insurance marketplace.\u201d\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech here.",

    "raw_text": "Roughly two and a half years after their patent battle began, Boston Dynamics and Ghost Robotics have settled the dispute on reasonably amicable terms. The robotics firms on Wednesday issued a joint release announcing the end of the dispute.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to resolve this dispute on mutually advantageous terms,\u201d Boston Dynamics Chief Legal Officer Jason Fiorillo noted. \u201cWe look forward to collaborating on common ground issues where our two companies might collaborate in the future, to advance the state of robotics in the United States and around the world.\u201d\n\nThe dispute arose from alleged infringement against a Boston Dynamics patent over legged robots. Exacerbating the battle was Ghost\u2019s seeming agnosticism with regard to military-mounted weaponry. A month prior, Boston Dynamics was one of a handful of robotics firms that contributed to an open letter condemning the weaponization of \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d robots.\n\nThat letter appeared to have been inspired \u2014 at least in part \u2014 by images of an autonomous rifle mounted to the top of a Ghost-produced robot dog that had recently made waves on social media.\n\nGhost co-founder and current CEO Gavin Kenneally responded to the recent resolution by emphasizing potential future collaborations with Boston Dynamics.\n\n\u201cThis resolution allows us to focus on driving innovation in robotics,\u201d Kenneally said. \u201cThis agreement underscores our shared commitment to advancing the progress of legged robots while fostering new opportunities for collaboration on key policy and technological initiatives.\u201d\n\nBoston Dynamics has its own roots in military contractors. DARPA was a key supporter in the Hyundai-owned company\u2019s earliest days. Notably, however, those early Boston Dynamics dogs were designed to transport payloads, rather than mounting weapons.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the United States has no national robotics strategy,\u201d Fiorillo added. \u201cCountries like China are heavily investing in robotics and AI, and setting aggressive technology acceleration goals at a national level. Without more direct interest and engagement from policymakers, the U.S. risks falling behind.\u201d\n\nThe two companies announced plans to meet early this year to \u201cdiscuss further policy proposals that could benefit both companies and the industry at large.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "UC Berkeley spinout Ambi Robotics announced Tuesday the arrival of AmbiStack, a novel system that automates pallet packing.\n\nThe system features an industrial robotic arm mounted above a conveyer belt that moves along the X and Y axes and lifts boxes up via suction cups mounted to a gripper. Once lifted from the conveyer belt, the boxes are tightly packed into pallets, which are used to ship or store packages.\n\nThe AmbiStack is notable because it combines two key warehouse operations into a single workflow, by both picking and stacking. Both are time-consuming and have been known to cause injury among human workers. Earlier solutions, such as forklifts, have introduced their own injury risk into the workplace. AmbiStack, meanwhile, effectively removes the human worker at these key stages of the logistics process.\n\nAmbi\u2019s solutions focus on both the hardware and software sides of the equation. AmbiStack\u2019s AI offering was trained on more than 200,000 hours of warehouse data, according to the company. That field experience helps the system analyze, track, pick, and place a variety of package sizes.\n\nPresales have already opened for the new system, with the first deployments expected to arrive in mid-2025. Ambi also plans to expand its own manufacturing processes in early-2026 to meet demand.\n\nAmbi was founded in 2018 by UC Berkeley students and lead robotics professor, Ken Goldberg. The firm\u2019s earlier solution, the AmbiSort A-Series, operates in a similar fashion, albeit with smaller parcel packages, which are sorted into bins. That process requires significantly less precision than stacking. The AmbiSort B-Series was released in 2023 with the ability to handle as many as 1,200 sorts in an hour.\n\nAmbi\u2019s AI-driven systems have helped the robotics startup bring in more than $67 million in funding from investors like Tiger Global and Bow Capital. High-profile shipping services have deployed Ambi\u2019s Systems, including Pitney Bowes, which signed a $23 million expansion deal with the firm in 2022.\n\nAmbi is one of a large number of warehouse/fulfillment robotics firms that greatly benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial shutdowns led many logistics companies to invest in automation. A continuing struggle to staff those roles in the intervening years has maintained such interest.",

    "raw_text": "Tesla earnings day is upon us \u2014 the quarterly check-in with one of the world\u2019s largest EV makers and its controversial CEO Elon Musk.\n\nTesla\u2019s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings are expected to be released Wednesday after market close. A webcast, in which Tesla management will answer questions from analysts and retail investors, is scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. ET.\n\nEver since Tesla\u2019s public debut in June 2010, the quarterly report and accompanying earnings call has delivered surprises, often from Musk\u2019s own mouth. This earnings \u2014 the first with Musk embedded in the Trump administration \u2014 is poised to be its most action-packed yet.\n\nRevenue and net income results are on our what-to-look-for checklist along with any guidance for 2025. Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 1.77 million vehicles globally in 2024, down 2.2% from 1.81 million in 2023. This was the first year-to-year drop in deliveries, and will likely translate to lower revenue unless other sectors in Tesla\u2019s business can close the sales gap.\n\nTesla\u2019s fourth-quarter delivery results did hint at some positive momentum heading into 2025. The company delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter, 7% higher than Q3 and about 2.28% more than the same period in 2023.\n\nStill, eyes will be on the financials, and ears will be listening for Musk to share their sales and profit expectations for 2025.\n\nThere are other nuggets we\u2019ll be watching for, including any Musk comments about President Trump\u2019s executive order to pause disbursement of funds from programs created by the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including money for EV charging stations.\n\nOf course, we\u2019ll be watching for any updates on the long-delayed Tesla Roadster, progress with the Tesla Semi, and how its Supercharger network is handling non-Tesla vehicles.\n\nRobotaxi dreams\n\nBut top on the list is how Musk will talk about his long-promised, never-delivered idea of making Tesla\u2019s cars autonomous. It\u2019s a promise that has kept the company\u2019s stock price sky-high, and one that animated Musk to cut more than 10% of Tesla\u2019s global workforce last year, when he said Tesla was going \u201cballs to the wall for autonomy.\u201d\n\nIt seems to be a priority ahead of the call \u2014 Tesla posted a video on Musk\u2019s social media platform X Wednesday morning that showed the company is now apparently having finished cars drive themselves about a mile to a delivery prep parking lot.\n\nMusk has claimed that Tesla will start letting people hail self-driving Teslas in Texas and California later this year, and Bloomberg recently reported that the company has been talking with city officials in Austin and across Texas about launching such a service.\n\nCalifornia is a more restrictive place to try to launch a robotaxi service. Companies like Waymo, which operates the only commercial robotaxi fleet in the U.S. at the moment, started with test vehicles and then ramped up to autonomous drives with safety operators, before removing humans from the driver\u2019s seat. Texas, which loves Musk, seems more likely to let Tesla take riskier shortcuts on the path to achieving Musk\u2019s dream.\n\nLooking back\n\nThose big ideas won\u2019t change the company\u2019s bottom line for 2024, though, which was looking iffy prior to the final quarter.\n\nThe company reported $25.2 billion in sales during the third quarter of 2024 and a $2.2 billion profit \u2014 nearly flat compared to the same quarter in 2023.\n\nHow close will the fourth quarter compare to the prior year\u2019s? On a year-over basis, Tesla generated $25.17 billion revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 and reported a net income (on a GAAP basis) of $7.9 billion in the fourth quarter. This was an unusually outsized figure that included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.9 billion for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.\n\nThe company\u2019s operating income and its earnings on an adjusted basis, which was $2.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, provided a clearer picture of its financial performance.\n\nThe company also continued to turn other automakers\u2019 hesitancy to transition to full-electric lineups into free money throughout 2024, though there is some question as to how reliable that income stream will remain.\n\nTesla booked $739 million worth of sales of regulatory credits (which other companies buy to make up for their vehicle fleet emissions) in the third quarter last year, a huge amount second only to the previous quarter when the company sold credits totaling $890 million.",

    "raw_text": "Last week, Founders Fund partner Delian Asparouhov realized he hadn\u2019t checked on his genetics in a while. He clicked open a dashboard created by Nucleus Genomics, a Founders Fund-backed startup that gets saliva samples sequenced and then compares the DNA results to extensive data linking health issues to genes. Within seconds, he concluded that he had a predisposition for schizophrenia, a sky-high IQ, and prostate cancer. \u201cBummer,\u201d he shrugged.\n\nIf Asparouhov\u2019s reaction seems nonchalant, it\u2019s only because he and the Nucleus team he backed are dreaming much, much bigger. Imagine a world where your medical treatments are tailored to your genetics or where every couple gets their DNA sequenced before having kids together \u2014 or a world where, as Asparouhov imagines, dating apps have a \u201ckid simulation\u201d that meshes your genetic tests together and shows you what a child might inherit.\n\nToday, Nucleus is a step closer to that future. The company, founded by 25-year-old Kian Sadeghi, announced a $14 million Series A, bringing its total funding to about $32 million. Investors like Alexis Ohanian\u2019s Seven Seven Six, Balaji Srinivasan and SpaceX alum Achal Upadhyaya have all rallied behind Sadeghi\u2019s vision for widely available genetic testing.\n\n\u201cDNA is actually the kind of ultimate health test,\u201d Sadeghi said. \u201cSo one swab and you get your analysis on about 800-plus conditions. And that\u2019s going to be rapidly growing over the next several months, until it\u2019s effectively every common and rare disease known.\u201d\n\nNucleus is possible because the cost of genome sequencing has plummeted in recent years. In 2007, genome sequencing cost close to $1 million. Today, Nucleus, staffed by a team of PhDs and genetic experts, charges $400 to send a saliva sample to a third-party sequencer and then analyze the results, telling users a host of potential illnesses they may be at risk for. Sadeghi believes that, in the next five years, \u201cthe cost of sequencing the genome is going to be negligible,\u201d and everyone will have \u201ctheir genome on their smartphone.\u201d\n\nSadeghi\u2019s dream began with tragedy. One night, his cousin died in her sleep from a previously unknown genetic condition. The loss permanently altered his life\u2019s path. He dropped out of college and moved home, where his schedule was as follows: wake up, meditate for an hour, scribble gene-related company plans in a notebook for 12 hours, meditate for another hour. \u201cI do believe in the soul,\u201d he reflected. \u201cI\u2019ve meditated every day for, I think, five years.\u201d\n\nHis year of work and meditation birthed Nucleus \u2014 and sent Sadeghi into the orbit of Silicon Valley\u2019s most famous contrarians. He first met Peter Thiel at Hereticon, the Founder Fund bash that celebrates all that is controversial (Sadeghi recalls a particularly exciting exorcist). It was a fitting place to meet, considering all the controversy that Sadeghi would court.\n\nLast year, Sadeghi launched Nucleus IQ, which tells users how much their genetics correlate with markers for high intelligence. Sadeghi puts a huge asterisk next to that claim: There is still much we don\u2019t know about the connection between genes and IQ, and, even if we did, genetics can only account for so much, while one\u2019s environment handles the rest.\n\nGeneticist Sasha Gusev called into question the accuracy of Nucleus\u2019s IQ tests (Sadeghi then published a lengthy defense), and others pointed out that Nucleus\u2019s IQ tests could lead to discrimination and stigmatization. Sadeghi\u2019s approach is also markedly different from competitors: Back in 2018, 23andMe told the MIT Technology Review it purposefully wouldn\u2019t release consumer information around genetics and intelligence for fear of \u201cmisinterpretation.\u201d\n\nBut Sadeghi and Asparouhov believe that the average American should have as much information about their genetics as possible. Asparouhov finds the hesitancy around Nucleus IQ \u201cvery odd,\u201d adding that if we\u2019re able to acknowledge genetic advantages in athletes (like, say, Michael Phelps\u2019 astonishing wingspan), why wouldn\u2019t we do the same for IQ? \u201cExperts claim that they know what\u2019s best for you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s best to just give consumers the information that\u2019s available to them and let them decide.\u201d\u2019\n\nAs Nucleus acquires more customers, Asparouhov says the company\u2019s insights will get even better, the results on a Nucleus dashboard automatically updating with new information. \u201cAt some point maybe there will be, like, phenotypic reporting, where you tell Nucleus, I have blue eyes, I have brown hair, maybe you come in for an IQ test, etc., and that actually improves the model,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if linking things like blue eyes, blonde hair, and IQ could be interpreted as eugenics, he clarified with a laugh, \u201cI said brown hair!\u201d\n\nThen, miming the same hand motion that Elon Musk performed following President Trump\u2019s inauguration, he joked, \u201cMy heart goes out to you.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "General Motors expects to save up to $1 billion annually by ending its Cruise robotaxi development program, CEO and Chair Mary Barra said Tuesday during the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nThe estimate comes nearly two months after the automaker said it would no longer fund Cruise, its self-driving subsidiary that aimed to commercialize robotaxis. \u201cGM has proposed a restructuring plan that will refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles,\u201d Barra said, adding the company expects to see a run rate savings of about $1 billion on an annualized basis by ending robotaxi development.\n\nCFO Paul Jacobson said those projected cost savings are \u201cbased on our assumption that Cruise employees will be fully integrated into GM by mid-year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe our refocused autonomous driving strategy will lead to efficiencies and a $1 billion annual run rate savings in our investment relative to the $1.7 billion we spent on Cruise in 2024,\u201d he said.\n\nGM reported Tuesday a $2.9 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2024, results driven by charges related to ending robotaxi development as well as costs associated with restructuring its China operations. The company took a $500 million one-time charge related to its decision to stop funding Cruise. It also reported a $4 billion non-cash restructuring charge and impairment of interests related to its China business.\n\nDespite those fourth-quarter hits, GM\u2019s full-year results \u2014 particularly on a pretax, adjusted basis \u2014 were rosier. The company reported net income of $6 billion for the year; on an adjusted basis, its annual profit was $14.9 billion.\n\nCruise expenses, excluding the special items for the restructuring charge, were $400 million in the quarter, down from $800 million in 2023.\n\nCruise employees were blindsided by GM\u2019s decision to pull back from the company, which the automaker had invested close to $10 billion in since 2016. Following the announcement in December, most of those employees have all but stopped working as they wait to hear if they will be among those who get laid off or those who get retention offers to join GM and work on autonomy there, according to two employees who spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity.\n\nGM offers customers Super Cruise, an advanced driver assistance system that can perform some automated driving tasks such as hands-free driving on certain highways. The automaker has been working to roll out a hands-free, eyes-off version of the technology, and may rely on Cruise self-driving technology to beef out Super Cruise\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe want to be leaders in Level 4 autonomy, and we think we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate the landscape to do that as capital efficiently as possible,\u201d Barra said, noting that GM is open to working with strategic partners.\n\nLevel 4 automated systems can drive themselves without requiring a human to take over in certain conditions.\n\nIn mid-January, Cruise management began extending retention offers to employees, almost all of whom were engineers, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nIn an email sent to Cruise staff on January 16, CEO Marc Whitten asked for continued patience as senior leadership worked out what the next steps would be and waited for the Cruise board to make a call.\n\n\u201cWhile our plans remain subject to Cruise board approval, I wanted to share that we completed our first wave of notifications to those employees whose roles we expect to need as part of the go-forward Cruise,\u201d Whitten said in the email, which TechCrunch has viewed.\n\nWhitten also said the company will continue to evaluate the rest of the team, and noted that those who haven\u2019t yet received a notification aren\u2019t necessarily at risk of losing their jobs.\n\nSources at Cruise told TechCrunch the board should be meeting in early February, at which time they\u2019ll hopefully come up with a plan for the thousands of now-idle and worried workers. That said, Barra said during Tuesday\u2019s earnings call she expects to finalize the Cruise restructuring plan \u201clater this quarter.\u201d\n\nJacobson noted Tuesday the expenditures for Cruise employees in GM\u2019s North America segment will be included in the company\u2019s financials later this year. He warned those expenditures will impact GM\u2019s North America margin \u201cby around 50 basis points this year,\u201d though he expects GM will remain \u201cwithin our 8 to 10% range.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will also increase our auto fixed costs and reduce our adjusted automotive cash flow, as the cash used by Cruise was excluded previously,\u201d Jacobson said.",

    "raw_text": "Quantum computing remains something of a holy grail in the world of technology: It promises a huge leap in computing power, but only if someone can figure out how to square away the fault rates that prevent any scaling of the tech.\n\nNow, one of the more promising quantum startups in Europe is announcing a big round of funding to help it work toward a solution.\n\nAlice & Bob, a Paris-based startup that is a pioneer in the area of cat qubit quantum architecture, has raised \u20ac100 million ($104 million). It plans to use this Series B to continue working toward building a \u201cfault tolerant\u201d quantum computer (accepting errors and working around them) based on cat qubits. Alice & Bob believes its first \u201cuseful\u201d quantum computer will be available by 2030.\n\n\u201cFrom the get go, Alice & Bob had a very clear vision of how quantum computers should be made [and] it was all about fault tolerance,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Th\u00e9au Peronnin in an interview. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the whole industry over the last 12 to 18 months is really a complete shift to align with our vision.\u201d\n\nThe appetite for more computing power is at the highest it has ever been \u2014 a belief underscored by major projects like the $500 billion Stargate AI data center commitment in the U.S., and the huge boost that computing chip makers like Nvidia have seen in recent times.\n\nAs Peronnin sees it, the traditional computing architecture race is untenable in the longer run, and that will drive more investment in quantum computing as it promises more efficiency than traditional processors.\n\n\u201cComputing is becoming the core resource for productivity, and quantum is a potential game changer here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game is on.\u201d\n\nThe investment is co-led by Qatari-backed Future French Champions (FFC), AVP (AXA Venture Partners), and Bpifrance, which also co-led its Series A of $30 million in 2022. While the startup is not disclosing its valuation, for some guidance, Riverlane (a partner of Alice & Bob\u2019s) was valued last year at around $400 million. We understand from multiple sources that Alice & Bob is at a comparable valuation, more likely between $300 million and $400 million.\n\nThe deal represents one of the larger rounds for a quantum computing startup in Europe. But notably for the quantum industry, it\u2019s not happening in a vacuum.\n\nSome of the more notable fundraises in the space include Riverlane, which also builds technology to correct quantum errors, raising $75 million; quantum chip maker SEEQC, which raised $30 million earlier this month; and Quantum Machines, which is reportedly also in the process of raising $100 million. Perhaps the biggest of all, last year, Quantinuum raised $300 million at a $5 billion valuation. There is now talk of it listing at a $10 billion valuation.\n\nMeanwhile, Google had a breakthrough in the fault-removal race in November 2024 with AlphaQubit, an AI system that it said could automatically identify errors in quantum computations. And, Microsoft and Atom Computing promised they would release a commercial quantum computer sometime this year.\n\nThe startup\u2019s name and the cat qubit are both key to what it is building. \u201cAlice & Bob\u201d is a reference to the two fictional characters that are often used as archetypes for hypothetical thought experiments in areas like cryptography and quantum physics.\n\nThe building block of Alice & Bob\u2019s system also has a theoretical reference in it. Rather than pursuing ways to reduce faults by throwing more qubits at the problem (qubits are the typical building blocks of a quantum computing system), Alice & Bob devised an architecture that it calls a \u201ccat qubit.\u201d This is a reference to Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat and the idea of something being in \u201ctwo states\u201d at once. Effectively, it accepts some faults (hence \u201cfault tolerant\u201d) while fixing others.\n\nAs Peronnin describes it, \u201ccat qubit is a special design of qubit that is meant to correct errors directly at the hardware level \u2014 not all of them, half of them, to be precise \u2014 but that is really the result of the cat qubit. It\u2019s to have this first layer of built-in error correction. And the reason why we went for that is because we believed it would dramatically simplify the total machine.\u201d\n\nAlice & Bob\u2019s investors believe this could be the key to making quantum a commercial reality.\n\n\u201cReality is at the core of our debate about quantum in the investment industry,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Robinet, a partner at AVP, said in an interview. He said that while he has been watching Alice & Bob for years, AVP hadn\u2019t wanted to invest before \u201cbecause it was just R&D\u201d like so many others. But now, he said, with quantum chip architecture appearing to be capable of supporting 48 qubits, \u201cwe believe the R&D phase is over.\u201d\n\nFran\u00e7ois Charbonnier, a partner at Bpifrance, seconds this. \u201cGetting rid one of two major errors,\u201d as Alice & Bob is doing, is the game changer for scaling, he said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s still a long-term marathon, but we are convinced that Alice & Bob will be in the race.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "It\u2019s only January, but the recent hack of U.S. edtech giant PowerSchool has the potential to be one of the biggest breaches of the year.\n\nPowerSchool, which provides K-12 software to more than 18,000 schools to support some 60 million students in the United States, confirmed the breach in early January. The California-based company, which Bain Capital acquired for $5.6 billion in 2024, said at the time that hackers used compromised credentials to breach its customer support portal, allowing further access to the company\u2019s school information system, PowerSchool SIS, which schools use to manage student records, grades, attendance, and enrollment.\n\n\u201cOn December 28, 2024, we became aware of a potential cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access to certain PowerSchool SIS information through one of our community-focused customer portals, PowerSource,\u201d PowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler told TechCrunch.\n\nPowerSchool has been open about certain aspects of the breach. Keebler told TechCrunch that the PowerSource portal, for example, did not support multi-factor authentication at the time of the incident, while PowerSchool did. But a number of important questions remain unanswered.\n\nThis week, TechCrunch sent PowerSchool a list of outstanding questions about the incident, which has the potential to impact millions of students in the U.S. Keebler declined to answer our questions, saying that all updates related to the breach would be posted on the company\u2019s SIS incident page, which hasn\u2019t been updated since January 17.\n\nPowerSchool told customers it would share an incident report from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the company hired to investigate the breach, on January 17. But several sources who work at schools impacted by the breach told TechCrunch that they have yet to receive it.\n\nThe company\u2019s customers also have lots of unanswered questions, forcing those impacted by the breach to work together to investigate the hack.\n\nHere are some of the questions that remain unanswered.\n\nIt\u2019s not known how many schools, or students, are affected\n\nTechCrunch has heard from schools affected by the PowerSchool breach that the impact could be \u201cmassive.\u201d However, PowerSchool\u2019s incident page makes no mention of the scale of the breach, and the company has repeatedly declined to say how many schools and individuals are affected.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch last week, Keebler said PowerSchool had \u201cidentified the schools and districts whose data was involved in this incident,\u201d but would not be sharing the names of those involved.\n\nHowever, communications from impacted school districts give a general idea of the size of the breach. The Toronto District School Board (TDSB), Canada\u2019s largest school board that serves approximately 240,000 students each year, said this week that hackers may have accessed some 40 years\u2019 worth of student data. Similarly, California\u2019s Menlo Park City School District confirmed that hackers accessed information on all current students and staff \u2014 which respectively number around 2,700 students and 400 staff \u2014 as well as students and staff dating back to the start of the 2009-10 school year.\n\nThe scale of the data theft is also unknown. PowerSchool also hasn\u2019t said how much data was accessed during the cyberattack, but in a communication shared with its customers earlier this month, seen by TechCrunch, the company confirmed that hackers stole \u201csensitive personal information\u201d on students and teachers, including some students\u2019 Social Security numbers, grades, demographics, and medical information. TechCrunch has also heard from multiple schools affected by the incident that \u201call\u201d of their historical student and teacher data was accessed.\n\nOne person who works at an affected school district told TechCrunch that the stolen data includes highly sensitive student data, including information about parental access rights to their children, including restraining orders, and information about when certain students need to take their medications.\n\nPowerSchool hasn\u2019t said how much it paid the hackers responsible for the breach\n\nPowerSchool told TechCrunch that the organization had taken \u201cappropriate steps\u201d to prevent the stolen data from being published. In the communication shared with customers, the company confirmed that it worked with a cyber-extortion incident response company to negotiate with the threat actors responsible for the breach.\n\nThis all but confirms that PowerSchool paid a ransom to the attackers that breached its systems. However, when asked by TechCrunch, the company refused to say how much it paid, or how much the hackers demanded.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what evidence PowerSchool received that the stolen data has been deleted\n\nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch earlier this month, PowerSchool\u2019s Keebler said the organization \u201cdoes not anticipate the data being shared or made public\u201d and that it \u201cbelieves the data has been deleted without any further replication or dissemination.\u201d\n\nHowever, the company has repeatedly declined to say what evidence it has received to suggest that the stolen data had been deleted. Early reports said the company received video proof, but PowerSchool wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny when asked by TechCrunch.\n\nEven then, proof of deletion is by no means a guarantee that the hackers are still not in possession of the data; the U.K.\u2019s recent takedown of the LockBit ransomware gang unearthed evidence that the gang still had data belonging to victims who had paid a ransom demand.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know who was behind the attack\n\nOne of the biggest unknowns about the PowerSchool cyberattack is who was responsible. The company has been in communication with the hackers but has refused to reveal their identities. CyberSteward, the Canadian incident response organization that PowerSchool worked with to negotiate, did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions.",

But there is tangible demand for cheaper and easier alternatives, particularly in underserved regions like Francophone Africa.\n\nThe Guinea-based fintech Cauridor is setting out to solve that, and it recently raised $3.5 million in seed funding to continue building its payment rails that let merchants, banks, telecom operators, and money transfer companies move funds in and out of Africa.\n\nCauridor says its platform supports mobile wallets, bank transfers, and cash pickups through a network of more than 25,000 agents across Guinea, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. These agents are part of a popular distribution method in the region \u2014 they\u2019re usually small business owners equipped with point-of-sale (POS) devices and enable cash deposits, withdrawals, and bill payments.\n\nCauridor is adopting a hybrid approach to solving the money transfer problem \u2014 the same way other fintechs in the region combine cash networks with digital infrastructure for local payment needs. Still, the approach has enabled it to operate remittance corridors to key markets like Ghana and Nigeria, and establish group-level contracts with major players such as Ria, MoneyGram, and Western Union, alongside partnerships with Orange and MTN.\n\nFrom remittance to B2B payments\n\nCauridor\u2019s founders Oumar Rafiou Barry and Abdoulaye Bah experienced firsthand the challenges of sending money back home to Guinea when studying in Canada. They faced slow, expensive remittance options in Francophone Africa, a region long underserved by the global remittance industry.\n\nIn 2019, this frustration drove them to start BNB CashApp, a consumer-focused remittance platform for users in Canada to send money to Africa. The app integrated directly with banks, mobile wallets like MTN, and an agent network equipped with a mobile portal to facilitate cash payouts.\n\nBut as the platform grew, the founders encountered a larger challenge: Africa\u2019s fragmented and inefficient payment infrastructure. \u201cWe realized early on that the rails in Francophone Africa were almost nonexistent. So we had to go in and start building payment rails in the region since the payments there were fragmented,\u201d CEO Barry told TechCrunch.\n\nSensing an opportunity, the team pivoted in 2022 to build payment rails for the region. By 2023, the company had merged its consumer remittance business and B2B payment infrastructure under the Cauridor brand, much like Tanzania\u2019s Nala\u2019s and Rafiki\u2019s operational model.\n\nThe shift paid off: Over 90% of the company\u2019s revenue now comes from its payment rails business. In 2023, Cauridor processed 2 million transactions and recorded total payment volume (TPV) of $300 million, which grew to $500 million in 2024, the company said.\n\nCompetition and future plans\n\nWhile Barry references more prominent players like Onafriq (formerly MFS Africa) and Thunes as Cauridor\u2019s main competition, he says his company has remained relevant because it built payment rails in markets \u201cno one was looking at,\u201d like Guinea and Liberia.\n\nHe noted that hands-on customer service and pricing have also helped it retain customers. The fintech provides customer service to resolve common issues like rejected mobile money transactions due to incomplete KYC. For example, if a recipient can only receive $10 out of a $700 payment, Cauridor steps in to help upgrade their account and ensure the transaction goes through.\n\nBarry thinks Cauridor\u2019s strong local presence gives it an edge in securing better forex margins, which it passes on to its customers. He said this advantage has helped the company attract major clients like MoneyGram, which switched from competitors for better rates and improved customer support.\n\nInterestingly, competition in the cross-border payments space doesn\u2019t rule out collaboration. Some of Cauridor\u2019s competitors rely on its infrastructure in specific regions, just as it partners with companies like Thunes for a global reach.\n\nCauridor employs about 200 people globally and has offices in Ivory Coast, Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.\n\nThe seed round was led by Pan-African VC firm Oui Capital and saw participation from Rally Cap, BKR Capital, and some angel investors.\n\nWith the fresh cash, the company plans to expand into new markets (it has new offices in Mali and Nigeria opening this year), flesh out its teams, and boost marketing efforts. Barry told TechCrunch that Cauridor is also preparing for a Series A round and exploring blockchain integration to streamline settlements and tap into the growing adoption of stablecoins in Africa\u2019s cross-border payment space.",

    "raw_text": "Researchers at Cornell University on Monday showcased a pair of bio-inspired robotics running on a hydraulic fluid-powered battery. The redox flow battery (RFB) also mimics biological functions, as it releases electrolytic fluids, which dissolve to create energy through chemical reaction.\n\nThe first two robots on display are a modular worm and a jellyfish, designed by the Cornell Engineering labs. The batteries powering these systems utilize embodied energy, \u201can approach that incorporates power sources into the body of a machine, to reduce its weight and cost,\u201d according to the school.\n\nMechanical and aerospace engineering Professor Rob Shepherd describes the underlying technology thusly: \u201cThere are a lot of robots that are powered hydraulically, and we\u2019re the first to use hydraulic fluid as the battery, which reduces the overall weight of the robot, because the battery serves two purposes, providing the energy for the system and providing the force to get it to move.\u201d\n\nIn addition to improving the speed and movements, the battery technology extended the robot jellyfish\u2019s runtime to an hour and a half. The robot itself was built atop technology the school utilized in the development of a lionfish-inspired biological robot. When that system was unveiled in 2019, researchers referred to the circulating liquid as \u201crobot blood,\u201d which presumably makes the battery a robot heart.\n\nThe RFB powering the jellyfish features a tendon that propels the robot upward when flexed into a bell shape. When the shape is relaxed, the robot sinks down. Footage of the system in action showcases familiar jellyfish-like movements as it navigates through the water.\n\nThe worm, meanwhile, is constructed from modular segments, similar to those seen on larger snake robots. Each segment contains a motor and a tendon actuator, which expands and contracts to create locomotion.\n\nThe team notes that the transition from underwater to land presented its own challenges. Chief among them is the fact that submerged robots don\u2019t require a rigid skeletal structure.\n\n\u201cThis is how life on land evolved,\u201d Shepherd says. \u201cYou start with the fish, then you get a simple organism and it\u2019s supported by the ground. The worm is a simple organism, but it has more degrees of freedom.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "In 2023, defense tech recruiter Peterson Conway VIII pulled up to the offices of nuclear fusion startup Fuse in a black Suburban, donning his signature cowboy hat. He picked up a recent Fuse hire and proceeded to regale her with stories of his old recruiting days. One story involved prostitutes attending a recruiting event (\u201cnot for sex,\u201d Conway clarified to TechCrunch).\n\nThe new hire was not happy. \u201cI thought I told it in a funny way,\u201d Conway sighed, admitting he was being \u201can a\u2013hole.\u201d\n\nFuse founder JC Btaiche caught wind of the conversation and agreed, promptly firing Conway \u2014 although Btaiche told TechCrunch that telling the prostitution story wasn\u2019t the only inappropriate thing that Conway had done.\n\nBut Conway, who has become one of the defense tech industry\u2019s biggest behind-the-scenes power brokers, didn\u2019t give up on Fuse. Conway has recruited for some of the buzziest defense and hard tech firms in Silicon Valley over the last decade, like Palantir and Mach Industries. He spent nearly half a decade doing recruitment for Joe Lonsdale\u2019s venture firm 8VC and for its portfolio companies, and since last year, he has been the head of talent at venture firm A*.\n\nSo even after being dismissed, Conway continued to pitch candidates to Btaiche and woo prospects with flights in his private plane or offers to \u201cgo blow s\u2014 up out in the desert,\u201d Conway said. After a few months, Fuse reinstated Conway. He has now recruited more than seven people to Fuse, including Fuse\u2019s chief strategy officer, Laura Thomas, a former CIA officer.\n\nIn many ways, Conway is a stand-in for the whole industry: rich, determined, prone to telling unbelievable stories, and, by all accounts, brilliant. According to the dozen people TC interviewed for this story, Conway is wildly successful at luring very talented people away from stable jobs and into startup life. \u201cThere\u2019s a line between crazy and genius,\u201d Btaiche said. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s just on that line.\u201d\n\nAs defense tech funding soared to almost $3 billion last year, Conway is ready to convince the next generation to help make new age nuclear reactors or AI-powered weapons.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of young people in the Valley, often working jobs in the defense sector or in national security or on very ambitious, difficult things,\u201d said Gregory Dorman, a recent Princeton graduate who worked with entrepreneur and A* partner Kevin Hartz on his new security startup Sauron, thanks to Conway\u2019s introduction. \u201cAnd they\u2019re there because of Peterson.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes not comply\u201d with safety regulations\n\nConway\u2019s signature move is to take candidates up in his tiny plane. \u201cI like to joke that I make them sick until they accept the terms of our deals,\u201d he said.\n\nI first met him at an airport in San Carlos, California, shortly before I climbed into his tiny two-seater plane, purchased with a loan from Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar. A small sign in the cockpit warned me: \u201cThis aircraft is an experimental light-sport aircraft and does not comply with federal safety regulations for standard aircraft.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, we were soaring over the shimmering San Francisco Bay as Conway recounted his fable-like life story. His father, Peterson Conway VII, dodged the draft, sold LSD in Tokyo, and eventually moved to Afghanistan in the \u201970s with Conway\u2019s mother, a Mormon school teacher. After a series of escapades across the Middle East and Africa, they moved to Carmel to raise Conway and his brother, but eventually divorced.\n\n\u201cMy dad threw himself off there,\u201d Conway said nonchalantly as we soared over the Golden Gate Bridge. He then explained that the attempted suicide was unsuccessful. His father was caught by the nets and is alive and well today, selling antiques in his Carmel shop.\n\nConway rebelled against his father by briefly pursuing normalcy, attending Dartmouth to study economics. But after college, in the early 2000s, he found himself becoming a recruiter.\n\nIn Conway\u2019s version of events, he was riding his motorcycle around San Francisco, a cowboy in search of office space. He spotted a warehouse with a ramp, rode onto it, and ran straight into Hartz. At the time, Hartz was in the early stages of building Xoom, a fintech service for international money transfers that was eventually bought by PayPal.\n\nConway said Hartz asked him if he had any skills. \u201cNone,\u201d Conway answered. \u201cBut I can bring lunches. I\u2019m a decent writer. I had an Airstream trailer \u2014 I\u2019m like, we can go surfing.\u201d\n\nHartz laughed when I asked him about the story, saying, \u201cThat is all entirely false.\u201d According to Hartz, Conway simply rented office space in the same building and that\u2019s how he started recruiting for Xoom and, later, the broader PayPal crowd.\n\nWhen PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel launched Palantir in 2003, Conway was in the right place at the right time and began recruiting for the firm. Conway apparently had no official title at the defense company, \u201dbut was \u2018just Peterson,\u2019\u201d like a defense tech \u201cmononymous artist in the style of Prince or Madonna,\u201d joked Gabe Rosen, 8VC\u2019s resident humanities scholar who worked with Conway at Palantir.\n\nPalantir sent Conway across the world to build out its international teams. According to Conway, the company wanted employees with an \u201cinternal compass and conviction,\u201d people who had grappled with the values they were raised with and paved their own path.\n\nFor example, Conway claimed he would get missives like \u201cfind me a Jew that married a Christian from the outback of Australia that was gay.\u201d Palantir had no comment.\n\nConway was known for getting recruits\u2019 attention by sending handwritten letters with wax seals. His methods were successful, landing people like Michael Leiter, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and many of Palantir\u2019s international hires.\n\nUnconventional methods\n\nLast summer, Conway and his father flew to the Mojave desert in Hartz\u2019s plane, borrowed for the occasion. Like some kind of American Dynamism mirage, they saw a gaggle of young men mounting a drone to the back of a truck.\n\nIt was a testing session for Mach Industries, a weapons company founded by Ethan Thornton when he was 19 years old. Mach is one of the handful of defense and hardware companies that has Conway recruited for as head of talent at A*. Mach has since raised over $80 million from investors like Bedrock and Sequoia Capital.\n\nWhile those men set up orange cones and explosive equipment for their engineering tests, Conway took people for trips in Hartz\u2019s plane. \u201cHe hit the ground so hard, so many times, landing in the Mojave,\u201d Hartz sighed. \u201cEverything came loose.\u201d Conway denied Hartz\u2019s account, saying the plane simply \u201cgot pretty dirty\u201d and he lost a window covering.\n\nAccording to Conway, he recruited SpaceX alum Gabriela Hobe and Fasil Mulatu Kero, Mach\u2019s vice president of manufacturing and former Tesla employee. \u201cEthan has probably paid me over a million dollars to do what I do for him,\u201d Conway said, although he later denied that figure.\n\nIt seems like everyone in the defense tech industry has an eye-popping story about Conway. One time, after Conway ordered an Uber and hit it off with the driver, he surprised a founder by setting him up with a ride and telling the founder to interview the driver for a job.\n\nAnother time, Fuse founder Btaiche said Conway left a Porsche with the keys in it at the airport for a recruit, who was then a government contractor, to drive when he touched down. The company later clarified that it was a four-seater Porsche, loaned to the candidate so the company could save money on Ubers.\n\nThe candidate took the Porsche for their meetings and ended the day at Conway\u2019s home, a sprawling compound in the wealthy California coastal town Carmel-by-the-Sea, stuffed with his father\u2019s antiques and animal parts from hunting expeditions. Conway hosts regular dinners for candidates there (his father cooks), as well as, according to Conway, parties ranging from a birthday bash for Joe Lonsdale to a wedding for Sankar.\n\nBut Btaiche said Conway\u2019s real superpower isn\u2019t his stunts, but rather his ability to talk about \u201ccandidates in a more human way, rather than just looking at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and credentials.\u201d\n\nFor Fuse hiring, Conway had Btaiche brainstorm what upbringing might create someone who can lead a team, or bring new ideas to the engineers; as a result, they\u2019ve scouted people from rural areas, people who grew up as athletes, and people who are obsessed with gaming.\n\nAs for winning candidates over, Btaiche said that Conway sells people on the imperative of defending America. \u201cIf you\u2019re working on something that is truly mission-driven,\u201d he said, \u201cI think Peterson can deliver that story.\u201d\n\nDorman, one of the people who had the Conway Experience, was a philosophy major at Princeton debating between careers in the Valley or New York when he met the famed recruiter. Conway persuaded him to choose the Valley. \u201cPeterson convinces people that there\u2019s actually a lot of adventure there,\u201d he said.\n\nConway has fashioned himself as something of a cowboy in the Valley for years, and now the rest of tech might have finally caught up. He applauds the current interest in American Dynamism, the term coined by Andreessen Horowitz for government-adjacent companies. \u201cIt is just perfect. It is right on the border of fanaticism,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIt\u2019s become its own religion.\u201d\n\nMain character energy\n\nThere\u2019s a common theme in how people describe Conway: a genius, an influential player in defense tech, and, at times, a liability.\n\nFor instance, a few days after I flew in his plane, he called me and asked, \u201cDid you see the news?\u201d\n\nThe day before, Conway had taken a 6 a.m. flight from the Carmel area to Silicon Valley. In the early morning darkness, Conway failed to pull out a flashlight when he was checking his fuel gauge and, as a result, misread the gauge. \u201cI made an assumption that was entirely pilot error,\u201d he said. As he was flying, he realized he didn\u2019t have enough in the tank to make it to the nearest airport.\n\nConway regaled the story to me in mythical proportions: a fork in his path, a choice between good and evil. As he described it, he initially thought his best chance at living was to land on a sports field at a nearby school. \u201cI started freaking out that a kid was no match for a propeller,\u201d he said.\n\nSo he opted to land his plane on Highway 85, touching down toward oncoming traffic in hopes that it would be safer for drivers. Miraculously, his two-seater glided onto the concrete, leaving Conway and the surrounding cars unharmed.\n\nConway then warned me that I had been a hair\u2019s breadth away from a similar fate. \u201cIf we had flown any further, we would\u2019ve run out of gas,\u201d he said.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t quite true; he told me later that he had flown the plane at least one time after our flight. But he painted our journey together in an existential light, making it unforgettable. After spending the day with him (and a subsequent two months fact-checking his many exaggerations), I learned that Conway is singular in his epic storytelling skills. That\u2019s why he gets hired by so many amazing companies. And fired. And then rehired once again.\n\nAs Dorman put it, \u201cHe\u2019s a super unconventional recruiter.\u201d Yet, he\u2019s also \u201cbetter than any other recruiter.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "The developer behind Pixelfed, Loops, and Sup, open source alternatives to Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp, respectively, is now raising funds on Kickstarter to fuel the apps\u2019 further development.\n\nThe trio is part of the growing open social web, also known as the fediverse, powered by the same ActivityPub protocol used by X alternative Mastodon. The latter saw increased signups and use after the company formerly known as Twitter sold to Elon Musk in October 2022 and during the X exodus that followed the U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn the months and years following that sale, open source and decentralized apps like Mastodon and Bluesky (which uses the newer AT Protocol), have continued to grow their user bases, as people sought alternatives to centralized social media apps controlled by billionaires like Musk and Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, even Meta realized it needed to plant a flag in the fediverse. This led it to release its own X rival in 2023 called Instagram Threads, which is in the process of integrating with ActivityPub.\n\nNow, Daniel Supernault, the Canadian-based developer behind the federated apps that challenge Meta\u2019s social media empire, is seeking funds for continued development and support of his open social communities.\n\n\u201cHelp us put control back into the hands of the people!\u201d he said in a post on Mastodon where he announced the Kickstarter\u2019s Thursday launch.\n\nAs of the time of writing, the campaign has raised $58,383 so far. While the goal on the Kickstarter site has been surpassed, Supernault said that he hopes to raise $1 million or more so he can hire a small team.\n\nSupernault wants his set of apps to become the first in the fediverse to reach a network of a billion people, but of course, there\u2019s still a long way to go before they can meet that lofty goal. Though Pixelfed has been around for years, it just launched the 1.0 version of its mobile app earlier this month, for instance, and Loops is still in alpha testing on Apple\u2019s TestFlight. Sup, meanwhile, has not yet been released but is said to be \u201ccoming soon,\u201d per its Instagram page.\n\nBoth Loops and Sup will be released to Kickstarter supporters.\n\nA fourth project, PubKit, is also a part of these efforts, offering a toolset to support developers building in the fediverse.\n\nIt includes interactive tools and testing frameworks, allowing developers to mock popular activities on their service, set up an inbox for ingesting and debugging activities in real time, and tools to inspect, debug, and verify HTTP Signature implementations.\n\nThis is the first time Supernault has turned to Kickstarter to help with these efforts, which aim to also benefit the Pixelfed Foundation.\n\nThe stretch goal of the Kickstarter campaign is to register the Pixelfed Foundation as a not-for-profit and grow its team beyond volunteers. This could help address the issue with Supernault being a single point of failure for the project, which has raised concerns in light of recent behavior.\n\nMastodon CEO Eugen Rochko made a similar decision earlier this month to transition to a nonprofit structure.\n\nIf successful, the campaign would also fund a blogging app as an alternative to Tumblr or LiveJournal at some point in the future.\n\nThe funds will also help the apps manage the influx of new users. On Pixelfed.social, the main Pixelfed instance, (like Mastodon, anyone can run a Pixelfed server), there are now more than 200,000 users, thanks in part to the mobile app\u2019s launch, according to the campaign details shared with TechCrunch. The server is also now the second-largest in the fediverse, behind only Mastodon.social, according to network statistics from FediDB.\n\nNew funds will help expand the storage, CDNs, and compute power needed for the growing user base and accelerate development. In addition, they\u2019ll help Supernault dedicate more of his time to the apps and the fediverse as a whole while also expanding the moderation, security, privacy, and safety programs that social apps need.\n\nAs a part of its efforts, Supernault also wants to introduce E2E encryption to the fediverse.",

    "raw_text": "What do AI voice agents and self-driving cars have in common? Their performance can be evaluated in the same way, argues Brooke Hopkins, a former tech lead at Waymo. Coval, Hopkins\u2019 new startup, looks to do just that.\n\n\u201cWhen I left Waymo, I realized a lot of these problems that we had at Waymo were exactly what the rest of the AI industry was facing,\u201d Hopkins (pictured above in the center) told TechCrunch. \u201cBut everyone was saying that this is a new paradigm, we\u2019re having to come up with testing practices from first principles and that basically we all have to recreate everything. And I looked at that and said, wait, we\u2019ve spent the last 10 years in self driving figuring out how to do this.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, she decided to launch Coval, a platform that builds simulations for AI voice and chat agents that tests and evaluates how they perform tasks in the same way Hopkins tested self-driving cars at Waymo. Coval can run thousands of simulations simultaneously, like having the agent make a restaurant reservation or having the agent respond to a customer service question asked in an indirect way.\n\nCoval\u2019s tech evaluates the agents on a general set of metrics, but companies can also customize what they are looking for and use Coval to continue to evaluate for regressions. Users can also take this data, and the insights they gleam off of it, and bring it to their end-customers either for a demo or as a monitoring tool to show their customers the agent is working as intended.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest blockers to agents being adopted by enterprises is them feeling confident that this isn\u2019t just a demo with smoke and mirrors,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cChoosing between vendors is a really complicated task for these executives because it\u2019s just very hard to know what you even ask or how do you even prove that these agents are doing what you expect. And so this gives our companies the ability to really show that and demonstrate it.\u201d\n\nHopkins really formulated the idea behind Coval during the Y Combinator Summer 2024 batch before launching the product publicly in October 2024. She said that demand has been strong and has become explosive in the last two months, with customers asking how quickly they can get their agents evaluated.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup is now announcing a $3.3 million seed round led by MaC Venture Capital with participation from Y Combinator and General Catalyst. The startup will use the capital to build out its engineering team and work to achieve product-market fit. Hopkins added that the company will also be working toward enabling its users to evaluate other types of AI agents, like web-based agents, in the future.\n\nCoval comes on the scene while both momentum \u2014 and hype \u2014 around AI agents appears to be at an all-time high. Enterprise tech leaders like Marc Benioff have been praising (and marketing) the technology by saying Salesforce will deploy more than a billion of its AI agents by next year. OpenAI is rumored to be releasing its take on an AI agent very soon.\n\nThere are also numerous startups building in the space. There were more than 100 startups building AI agents across Y Combinator\u2019s three 2024 cohorts alone. Some AI agent startups have landed sizable venture funding rounds too. One, /dev/agents, raised a $55 million seed round at a $500 million valuation in November 2024, less than a year after it was founded.\n\nThis momentum means it\u2019s likely that there will be more companies looking for help to evaluate their agents too. Hopkins said Coval has a good shot at standing out from the pack because, unlike the inevitable new entrants, Coval has a head start.\n\n\u201cI think where we really stand out is I\u2019ve been working in this space for half a decade and I\u2019ve built these systems over and over,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve built multiple iterations and we\u2019ve seen how they fail and how they scale and we\u2019re building the same concepts into Coval and all of those learnings.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "Uber-backed Moove, an Africa-born mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers across six continents, has acquired Kovi, a Brazilian urban mobility provider.\n\nThe value of the deal is not being disclosed, but Moove confirmed it was an all-share transaction, and Kovi is now wholly owned by Moove.\n\nMoove co-founder and co-CEO Ladi Delano told TechCrunch that the deal bumps the mobility fintech\u2019s annual revenue to $275 million. Last March, Moove reported a $115 million ARR.\n\nThe news comes two months after Moove announced a partnership with Waymo to provide driverless vehicle fleet operations in two U.S. cities, Phoenix and Miami.\n\nDelano said Moove\u2019s acquisition of the S\u00e3o Paulo-based Kovi marks a significant step toward the company\u2019s goal of building the world\u2019s largest rideshare fleet. What began with 76 cars in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2020 has now grown to 36,000 cars operating in 19 cities across six continents, with Latin America now emerging as a key market.\n\nSimilarly, the acquisition unites two companies tackling the same challenge \u2014 providing financing solutions for rideshare drivers. Founded in 2018, Y Combinator-backed Kovi launched to make vehicle ownership more accessible in Brazil. Following the acquisition, pending approval from the Brazilian antitrust authority, Kovi will continue to operate under its brand while its executive and management teams will remain unchanged.\n\nWhile Moove will keep the Kovi brand operating in its existing markets, Brazil and Mexico, there are plans to expand further across Latin America. Moove recently launched operations in three cities across Colombia and Mexico. As such, the acquisition further cements Moove\u2019s position in Latin America, giving the company a major foothold in Brazil, the region\u2019s largest ride-hail market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about working with a fantastic team of like-minded individuals at Kovi who set up this business to address a similar problem that we found in Nigeria,\u201d he remarked. \u201cKovi is one of the top two players in Brazil. So we have not just entered or strengthened our presence in the Latin American market but also put ourselves in a top-two position in the largest single market in Latin America through this acquisition.\u201d\n\nMoove has built a third pillar in the global mobility marketplace by offering vehicle supply to ride-hailing platforms. This includes its flagship Drive-to-Own product, a taxi and employment model, and an emerging autonomous vehicle (AV) business line involving AI-driven mobility.\n\nWhile AI plays a key role in its AV business line, Delano says the company\u2019s AI mobility strategy will span the entire business, from optimizing traditional ride-hailing services to improving fleet management, according to Delano. This is where the Kovi acquisition comes in. According to the chief executive, Kovi\u2019s proprietary technology and algorithms will \u201ccomplement and strengthen our existing Moove AI mobility strategy and ensure that we can start to deliver an improved service and product to our customers around the world.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Kovi was struggling financially before its acquisition by Moove. Its last known funding round was a $104 million Series B in 2021 from investors like Valor Capital, Prosus Ventures, and Quona Capital. Despite raising funds to expand across Latin America, Kovi primarily focused on Brazil. That year, it reported $45 million in ARR, growing 15% month-over-month.\n\nThe all-share transaction makes Kovi\u2019s investors shareholders in Moove, aligning their growth trajectories. In a statement, Kovi CEO Adhemar Milani Neto expressed confidence in the deal. \u201cI met the founders [Moove\u2019s Delano and Jide Odunsi] many years back when they were scaling their business in Africa, and I was immediately impressed by their purpose-driven approach, which is also a perfect match to our culture. Together, I believe we will become a truly global category-defining business and will leverage scale and deep expertise never seen in our market.\u201d\n\nMoove raised a $100 million Uber-led Series B last year at a $750 million valuation. The mobility fintech has secured over $500 million in debt and equity from backers like Mubadala, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Janus Henderson, and the IFC (World Bank) since its launch five years ago.\n\nDelano declined to comment on potential new fundraising efforts. Instead, he stressed that the company will focus on driving its capex-heavy business to profitability this year and realizing its vision of building the largest ride-hailing fleet globally.",

    "raw_text": "Few fusion startups have been as closely watched as Helion. The 12-year-old company is backed by Sam Altman, rumored to be in talks with OpenAI, and has a deal to supply Microsoft with electricity by 2028 \u2014 years earlier than its competitors.\n\nThe company\u2019s unorthodox approach to fusion power and relative secrecy has earned it plenty of fans \u2014 and critics. But don\u2019t count its investors among the naysayers.\n\nHelion announced Tuesday a $425 million Series F raise that pushed its valuation $5.245 billion. The startup also flipped the switch last month on its latest prototype, Polaris, which it anticipates will be the first fusion reactor to generate electricity.\n\nPolaris, Helion\u2019s seventh prototype, sits inside a 27,000-square-foot building in Everett, Washington. It took more than three years to build, which is quick by fusion industry standards. But to hit its ambitious 2028 deadline for Microsoft, the startup will have to move even faster on its commercial-scale power plant.\n\nThe difficulties Helion faces are in many ways similar to those in other leading-edge industries.\n\n\u201cIn AI, what\u2019s the big challenge? Getting the chips. In fusion, what\u2019s the big challenge? Getting the chips,\u201d CEO David Kirtley told TechCrunch in a recent interview. \u201cPolaris is 50,000 of these large-scale, pulse-power semiconductors, and getting those set the timeline.\u201d\n\nThe solutions it\u2019s seeking are similar, too. The new investment will go toward bringing a significant amount of specialized manufacturing in-house. For example, the company had to order a type of short-term energy storage device known as capacitors three years in advance.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to go from waiting three years for a supplier to give us capacitors to us making our own capacitors but faster, so now we can make them in a year or less,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite having to build a supply chain from scratch, Kirtley remains optimistic that Helion can still deliver electrons to Microsoft in just a few years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on siting for the Microsoft facility for a few years already,\u201d Kirtley said. He declined to name a location, but said the company has been working on permitting and grid interconnection, a process that can take years.\n\nPart of Helion\u2019s appeal \u2014 and part of the risk, critics would argue \u2014 is that its approach to fusion power differs from virtually every other startup in the sector.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two main approaches: Magnetic confinement uses powerful magnets to squeeze plasma to get it hot and dense enough to spark fusion reactions, which are meant to burn continuously to generate steam to drive a turbine. Inertial confinement fires powerful lasers at fuel pellets, compressing them to the point where the fuel atoms fuse. To generate enough heat to feed a steam turbine, a reactor has to fire several times per second.\n\nHelion is building something completely different, known as a field-reversed configuration reactor. The device looks like an hourglass with a bulge in the middle, and it\u2019s ringed with powerful magnets, which guide and compress the plasma throughout the course of each reaction, which Helion calls a \u201cpulse.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of a pulse, Helion injects a mix of deuterium and helium-3 into each end and heats it until it forms a plasma. Magnets then shape each plasma into a doughnut and propel them toward each other at more than 1 million miles per hour.\n\nWhen the plasmas reach the fusion chamber \u2014 the bulge in the middle of the hourglass \u2014 they collide and are squeezed further by another set of magnets. This heats the plasma to more than 100 million degrees C, leading to a cascade of atoms fusing. Altogether, it\u2019s similar to how a spark plug ignites fuel inside an internal combustion engine.\n\nThe energy added by the fusion reactions generates a surge in magnetic force, which pushes back on the reactor\u2019s magnets. This extra magnetic force is then converted directly into electricity. If everything works as intended, Helion\u2019s reactor will generate more electricity from that magnetic burst than it needed to power the magnets in the first place. And because the system harvests electricity from magnets instead of generating steam to spin a turbine, it should be more efficient, lowering the bar to break even.\n\nThe current design for a commercial-scale Helion reactor will pulse a few times per second, Kirtley said. A single reactor will generate 50 megawatts of electricity, and a power plant could contain multiple reactors.\n\nIn the lab, the company has small systems that can fire more than 100 times per second, so it\u2019s possible that future Helion reactors will be able to fire 60 pulses per second, the same frequency as electricity on the grid. \u201cBut there\u2019s some big engineering challenges to get to those high repetition rates at the kind of big pulse powers where we talk about millions of amps flowing around,\u201d Kirtley said.\n\nHelion raised the new funding to speed work on the power plant, including expanding in-house machining capabilities and capacitor manufacturing. \u201cOne of the things that drove the Polaris timeline was actually making all the magnetic coils. And so I want to be able to make all of those in-house,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new round is smaller than the startup\u2019s previous fundraise of $500 million. New investors in the round include Lightspeed Venture Partners, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, and a major university endowment. Existing investors Sam Altman, Capricorn Investment Group, Mithril Capital, Dustin Moskovitz, and Nucor also participated.",

Plus, we have one new startup to track.\n\nBlazing through public markets: Blaize, an AI chip startup founded by Intel engineers in 2011 that focuses on edge applications, went public Tuesday after announcing its intention to do so via a SPAC the day before.\n\nBuy now, pay now: Amazon is set to buy Indian BNPL startup Axio for over $150 million, according to sources. This will help the e-commerce giant accelerate its push into financial services in India, which is one of its fastest-growing markets.\n\nCar sales: eBay plans to acquire Caramel, a startup that helps car sellers and buyers complete the final steps of the transaction. It previously acquired Cargigi, an advertising and marketing tech company for car dealerships, as well as U.K. classifieds site Motors.co.uk.\n\nMoody\u2019s buys Cape: Moody\u2019s agreed to acquire geospatial AI startup Cape Analytics for an undisclosed sum. This will give the financial services firm the ability to create a property database that it plans to use for delivering local risk insights for its insurance clients.\n\nAn idea for AGI: High-profile AI researcher Fran\u00e7ois Chollet teamed up with Zapier co-founder and head of AI Mike Knoop to launch Ndea, an AI research and science lab looking to \u201cdevelop and operationalize\u201d artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nMost interesting VC and funding news this week\n\nMammoth ambitions: Colossal Biosciences raised a $200 million Series C round of funding at a colossal $10.2 billion valuation with the equally big ambition of bringing back the woolly mammoth and two other extinct species.\n\nTaking off: Fast-growing space infrastructure startup Loft Orbital raised $170 million in Series C funding co-led by Tikehau Capital and Axial Partners. It declined to reveal its valuation, but that\u2019s more capital in one round than the combined $160 million it had raised to date.\n\nRise of avatars: Synthesia, a British startup whose AI technology helps companies build avatar-based videos, closed a Series D funding round of $180 million led by NEA at a valuation of $2.1 billion.\n\nGPT for biology: French AI startup Bioptimus raised $41 million to develop a foundational AI model for biology, trained specifically for downstream biological applications.\n\nDigital switch: With the ambition to become the biggest fintech startup in the healthcare industry, Berlin-based startup Nelly raised $51 million in Series B funding to help more medical practices switch to a digital workflow.\n\nQuantum acceleration: Quantum computing startup SEEQC raised a $30 million Series A extension co-led by Booz Allen and NordicNinja to accelerate the commercial rollout of its chips and improve their capabilities.\n\nSpinning off: Intel announced plans to spin off its corporate venture arm, Intel Capital, into a stand-alone fund, which will begin operating independently in the second half of 2025 with Intel as an \u201canchor investor.\u201d\n\nFounders and investors: Powerset, the investment program co-founded by AngelList alum Jake Zeller that operates as a sort of decentralized venture fund, will give five to 10 founders $1 million to invest in other startups.\n\nNvidia\u2019s AI empire: Only a few days after TechCrunch\u2019s roundup of Nvidia\u2019s startup investments, another one was added: MetAI, a Taiwanese company that creates Al-powered digital twins.\n\nLast but not least",

Symbotic is paying $200 million in cash for the program, plus up to $350 million in \u201cadditional contingent consideration,\u201d depending on how the deal shakes out.\n\nThe relationship is more partnership than straight acquisition, however, massively bolstering Symbotic\u2019s longtime position as a key Walmart technology supplier. As part of the deal, Walmart is paying Symbotic a total of $520 million \u2014 a sum that includes $230 million if it closes.\n\nSymbotic provides back-end hardware and software systems for warehouses and distribution. This deal will essentially find the company taking control of automating Walmart\u2019s pickup and delivery centers.\n\nWalmart is regarded as Symbotic\u2019s \u201canchor\u201d partner, with deals dating back to 2017, when the retailer began introducing its automated systems into its U.S. distribution centers. It\u2019s not entirely clear what the deal will mean for future contracts with non-Walmart customers, though in some ways it echoes Amazon\u2019s 2012 purchase of Kiva Systems, which gave rise to the Amazon Robotics division.\n\nThe deal was announced in the days leading up to a second Trump administration, which is expected to have a much lighter touch with regard to corporate M&As. Amazon\u2019s recent attempt to purchase Massachusetts-based iRobot ultimately died on the vine due to international regulation, leaving the Roomba-maker in a financial hole.\n\nThe Symbotic deal, meanwhile, is expected to close in Q2 2025.",

    "raw_text": "Openvibe\u2019s clever app that integrates multiple open social networks, including Bluesky, Mastodon, Nostr, and Threads, just got a boost toward its future development. The company on Tuesday announced that it has received outside investment of $800,000 in a round led by Czech Founders VC, which includes backing from WordPress.com and Tumblr parent company, Automattic, as well as Tensor Ventures.\n\nCzech Founders VC and former CTO of Mews Jan \u0160irok\u00fd also invested separately from his firm.\n\nLaunched in 2024, Openvibe initially supported three of the more prominent open social networks, all of which operate using different protocols: Mastodon uses ActivityPub, Bluesky runs on AT Protocol, and Nostr powers a number of third-party apps. Openvibe later added support for Instagram Threads, as that app became further integrated with ActivityPub and opened itself up to the developer community.\n\nAs CEO Matej Svancer explained at the time, the idea behind his app was to offer users a more friendly and \u201ceasy-to-use gateway\u201d to the open social web. Because of the different protocols these networks utilize, it can be difficult for newcomers who end up having to switch apps or limit their engagement to just their preferred platform.\n\nBut Openvibe doesn\u2019t just let people stay connected with friends across all these services in a combined timeline, it also allows cross-posting to multiple networks at once.\n\nWith the added capital, Svancer plans to accelerate product development, expand Openvibe\u2019s user base, work on integrations with other social platforms, refine the user interface, and more.\n\nIn addition, Automattic\u2019s investment is worth noting, as the company historically backs projects in the open source space, particularly those designed to compete with Big Tech. (Unfortunately, Automattic CEO and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg has created a lot of division and drama within the WordPress community over the past several months, which has some questioning his commitment to open source values.)\n\nStill, Openvibe\u2019s fundraising signals that there is some appetite among investors for backing apps and services that are taking advantage of the new open social protocols. Recently, for example, celeb investor and entrepreneur Mark Cuban put out a call for video apps building on Bluesky\u2019s AT Protocol. Bluesky has also raised funding, most recently its $15 million Series A last fall.",

Sign up here.\n\nThis week was supposed to be a short one in the U.S., as it started with a holiday. But Inauguration Day kept some founders busy, and the following days brought us more than their fair share of startup news.\n\nMost interesting startup stories from the week\n\nThis week reminded us that not all sales are created equal, and that it is often worth looking beyond the price tag. Plus, there were legal troubles for an AI decacorn.\n\nNo divvy: Divvy Homes, a rent-to-own startup backed by a16z, is selling to a division of Brookfield Properties for about $1 billion. However, some shareholders may not see a dime from the sale.\n\nBeauty for sale: Consumer goods giant Hindustan Unilever agreed to acquire Peak XV-backed Indian skincare startup Minimalist for about $342 million \u2014 more than the $300 million valuation it reportedly sought in a fundraising attempt last year.\n\nBig markdown: AI-powered parking platform Metropolis acquired computer vision company Oosto for a fraction of what the startup had raised to date. Formerly known as AnyVision, it had lost backers over its technology being used in controversial surveillance applications.\n\nLegal clash: Valued at $13.8 billion last year, Scale AI is facing its \u200b\u200bthird worker lawsuit of 2025, with contractors claiming they suffered psychological harm from writing prompts about disturbing content. A spokesperson for Scale AI said it had \u201cnumerous safeguards in place.\u201d\n\nMost interesting VC and funding news this week\n\nSeries B rounds announced this week varied greatly in size, with some of these exceeding other Series C rounds. And for companies that don\u2019t quite feel like going public yet, there are still more letters in the alphabet.\n\nPre-IPO letters: Data analytics platform Databricks closed a $10 billion Series J equity funding round at a $62 billion valuation, with an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing. Meta is backing the company as a strategic investor.\n\nFrom cat to unicorn: Neko Health, the Swedish body-scanning startup co-founded by Spotify\u2019s Daniel Ek, and whose name means \u201ccat\u201d in Japanese, raised a $260 million Series B round of funding at $1.8 billion post-money.\n\nMoney to move: Lindus Health, a startup backed by Peter Thiel and Creandum that is currently moving its HQ from the U.K. to the U.S., secured a $55 million Series B round to \u201cfix the broken clinical trial industry.\u201d\n\nSpending less: AI-powered SaaS spend management platform Vertice raised a $50 million Series C round of funding led by Lakestar, at a valuation close to $500 million, according to sources.\n\nIndian robotics: Indian-based autonomous mobile robots startup Ati Motors raised a $20 million Series B to grow internationally. The U.S. already dominates Ati\u2019s revenues, and the company hopes to further benefit from demand for robotics manufactured outside of China.\n\nCrypto crypto crypto: Capitalizing on crypto\u2019s comeback, AngelList and CoinList teamed up to launch crypto special purpose vehicles and crypto roll-up vehicles that will let crypto founders raise capital using crypto coins.\n\nLast but not least",

    "raw_text": "For many emerging market economies, remittances have become a lifeline. Inflows surpassed $669 billion in 2023, according to World Bank research, and they now represent significant portions of GDP in these countries, often outpacing foreign direct investment as the primary source of foreign exchange.\n\nTraditional banks and agents maintain a firm grip on the remittance market, with over 60% market share despite fierce competition from new tech challengers. Some of these challengers, like Remitly, have gone public, while others, such as Zepz and Taptap Send, remain privately owned \u2014 all vying for the remaining share.\n\nLemFi, the London-based financial services platform designed for immigrants, is one such new player. It\u2019s now armed with $53 million in new funding, which it will use to fuel efforts to acquire more customers and further expand into more countries.\n\nSince its launch in 2020, LemFi has undergone rapid growth by helping diaspora communities in North America and, more recently, Europe, send money to emerging markets across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The 4-year-old fintech boasts over 1 million active users who rely on its multi-currency accounts to transfer money to friends and family in countries like Nigeria, Kenya, India, China, Pakistan, and 15 others.\n\nLast week, the company expanded into Europe by partnering with embedded finance provider Modulr. This partnership will help LemFi kickstart operations until it secures its license next month after acquiring a Republic of Ireland-based firm. With this move, LemFi \u2014 whose revenue comes from transaction fees and foreign exchange spreads \u2014 now operates in 27 send-from markets and 20 send-to countries.\n\nOne way the company has gained traction is through aggressive fraud detection. One recent report says that people sending money abroad are nearly four times more likely to fall victim to financial fraud than those who don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cFraud can significantly drive up costs. Higher costs often mean passing them on to customers through additional fees. We\u2019ve managed to keep our fraud rate extremely low, allowing us to offer customers the best possible prices,\u201d LemFi co-founder and CEO Ridwan Olalere, who founded LemFi with CFO Rian Cochran after the duo met at African fintech unicorn OPay, told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019ve built a brand and reputation in certain communities because of that, as well as our user experience, which makes our customers refer it to their friends. That has helped us differentiate and grow even faster than you would expect in such a competitive market.\u201d About 70% of LemFi\u2019s earliest customers still use the platform, while 60% of its customer base is active yearly.\n\nWhen we reported on LemFi\u2019s expansion into Asia and its broader strategy last April, Olalere revealed that the fintech recorded over $2 billion in annual transaction volume in 2023. Fast-forward to now, and the remittance platform is processing half that \u2014 $1 billion \u2014 in monthly payment volume, Olalere told TechCrunch in a recent interview. He credits this surge to strong adoption in the Asian corridor, which rakes in $160 million in monthly TPV and is growing 30% month-on-month within its first year of launch.\n\nOlalere also shared that the company doubled users, revenue, and transactions over the past two years, and that played a role in attracting investor interest and confidence. This growth momentum led to a Series B round led by Highland Europe, a London-based growth-stage investment firm that backs startups with more than \u20ac10 million in annualized revenues.\n\nThe round, which, according to Olalere, closed in just four months, also saw participation from existing investors Left Lane Capital, Palm Drive Capital, and Y Combinator and new investors like Endeavor Catalyst, bringing LemFi\u2019s total funding to $85 million.\n\nLemFi will use the funding to extend its offerings, scale its payment network licenses and partnerships to provide hyper-localized service, and recruit talent for its next growth phase. The firm currently has more than 300 employees across Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia.\n\n\u201cWhile regulations market by market remain complex and we have more stakeholders to deal with, scaling has become a lot easier for us because we have technology that is adaptable and can easily plug and play to different payment methods and schemes,\u201d Olalere noted. \u201cSo, we intend to go to as many markets as we have significant number of immigrants, starting now with Europe this year, which is going to be a big focus for us.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "Jared Zhao originally got interested in data analytics during his time at UC Berkeley because he was drawn to how it could turn raw data into a story. Zhao founded his first data analytics startup Polyture in 2021. But advancements in generative AI just a year later made Zhao realize what Polyture was building was too complicated for what users would be looking for in a post-ChatGPT world, and decided to change course.\n\nThe result was Athenic AI, a company that uses AI to run data analytics for enterprises across all of their data sources. Zhao, the founder and CEO, said that Athenic\u2019s products are designed to be a central nervous system of an organization\u2019s databases that can be used by anyone in the company regardless of their coding or data experience.\n\nZhao (pictured above in the center) added that Athenic is built to be flexible and can work with companies to get its AI to understand company \u201ctribal knowledge,\u201d KPIs, or internal terminology so that the AI has the needed context to run proper analytics.\n\nEach data report the AI-driven system pulls includes an explanation of how the AI interpreted the data, which makes it easier for users to spot potential errors and give the AI model feedback. Zhao added that this helps with visibility and that while they want the AI to get as close to 100% accuracy as it can, human data analysts can\u2019t reach 100% accuracy either.\n\n\u201cEven when the system is wrong, it is aware that it might be wrong, and it explains to the user why it thinks that it could be wrong,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what a good data analyst does. They don\u2019t just give you the report or the chart, they also give you an executive summary that explains how you should interpret this and what they did to do this analysis.\u201d\n\nThe company was founded in 2022 and launched its product in summer 2022. Since it launched, Athenic has been able to land customers ranging from small startups to large enterprises, including Additel and PMC. Zhao said that the company has found many of its smaller customers through outbound sales leads but that the majority of their enterprise clients came from inbound interest.\n\nSan Francisco-based Athenic is now announcing a $4.3 million seed round led by BMW i Ventures with participation from TenVC, Scrum Ventures, and Stage 2 Capital, among others. Zhao said the money will be put toward hiring and building out new tech capabilities.\n\n\u201cToday, the user asks questions and pulls the insights out of the system that they want to see,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a world where the data has some kind of insight that\u2019s innate to the data that we\u2019ll want to suggest to the user before they even ask.\u201d\n\nSamantha Huang, a principal at BMW i Ventures, told TechCrunch that she got introduced to Athenic in kind of a random way. Huang said that her firm decided to get a better feel of the AI startup ecosystem in general and \u201cboiled the ocean\u201d by reaching out to as many AI startups as they could to get a vibe check.\n\nAthentic was one of them. Huang said the company stood out from other data analytics companies because of the fact that it helps companies get the AI models set up with company-specific context and knowledge.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies will use these generic, monetized, foundational models, but the problem is, technically, the model, it\u2019s kind of dumb if you don\u2019t know what the data in the customer\u2019s environment looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cJared took a new approach, combining a knowledge graph plus foundational models that allowed him to bridge that problem.\u201d\n\nThe data analytics market is crowded, and likely will get increasingly so as generative AI improves and more companies look to capitalize on how AI can improve the management and use of their data. Databricks is just one example in this sector that has raised more than $19 billion in venture capital and is currently valued at $62 billion. There are also numerous data storage and optimization-focused companies that could easily expand into that space.\n\nZhao thinks the company\u2019s approach of focusing heavily on user experience and ensuring that the AI models have the proper company context helps set them apart.\n\n\u201cWe just think that there are too many businesses that are being run without the proper knowledge, even though all the data is technically there,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cFolks at the top sometimes, not out of ignorance, a lot of times are flying blind, and that\u2019s the problem that we really want to solve.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "1X has acquired Kind Humanoid, the Norwegian robotics startup told TechCrunch on Monday. The deal marks a small but key consolidation for a humanoid robotics industry on the brink of a major moment in 2025.\n\nTechCrunch spoke with Kind Humanoid in October, when the then-three-person startup announced that it had enlisted famed designer Yves B\u00e9har to help create its first commercial robot.\n\nThe story had all the charm one anticipates from a plucky startup formed in a Silicon Valley garage. CEO and ex-Google robotics researcher Christoph Kohstall gave us a quick tour of the company\u2019s chaotic East Bay headquarters via Zoom on his phone. He revealed, among other things, that Kind had eschewed a ceiling-mounted gantry system visible in the shot for a far less conventional $80 coat rack.\n\nAlong with attracting B\u00e9har \u2014 the designer of products like the Jawbone fitness tracker, One Laptop Per Child, and August Locks \u2014 Kind clearly won over fellow robotics firms. Meanwhile, 1X has made headlines for both its generative AI-driven approach to the space and its high-profile funding rounds, including $100 million raised last January.\n\nFirms, including Tiger Global and OpenAI, have counted themselves as investors. The latter is especially notable as interest around platforms like ChatGPT show no sign of slowing. Much of Kind\u2019s work, meanwhile, has focused on the role large language models are likely to play as more robotics firms push to create a kind of general intelligence to couple with general-purpose form factors like humanoids.\n\n1X notes:\n\nKind Humanoid\u2019s unique expertise and culture complement 1X\u2019s mission to create an abundance of labor through safe and intelligent humanoids. The relationship between the two newly joined companies is built on the foundational belief that humanoids need to be developed alongside humans \u2014 living and learning among us\n\nKind\u2019s operations will also help 1X expand its Bay Area operations. Details of the deal have not been disclosed.",

    "raw_text": "With inflation still stubbornly high in comparison to previous years, and the siren voices of subscription services like Netflix and Spotify continuing to lure, consumers have understandably turned to alternative forms of payment to manage their household bills.

Between 2024 and 2028 it\u2019s expected to record a CAGR of 9.1%, increasing from over $251 billion in 2023 to $395 billion by 2028.\n\nMore interestingly, Recharge\u2019s application for an e-money license with the Dutch authorities suggests it has plans to create a more robust \u201cfintech-style\u201d platform.\n\nVogelpoel said Recharge is \u201cvery keen\u201d on evolving into the financial services space: \u201cWe are in the application process of applying for an E-money license in the Netherlands, which will grant us a license for Europe. With that, we can launch our own financial services.\u201d He added that they would be in the market for a wallet-like or card-type kind of company \u201cthat would have a good fit with our current customer base.\u201d\n\nBut what about the technology aspect of this next phase?: \u201cWe are a profitable company,\u201d said Vogelpoel. \u201cWe have over 30% growth in 2024 which boosted our profit profitability as well. So we have money in the bank to invest in our platform and technology.\u201d\n\nHe said moving into holding larger funds for customers also makes sense: \u201cIf you have a wallet as a central product, then you can connect other services to that wallet as well as payments or cards that people could use for issuing virtual cards\u2026 Neo banks have a really good portfolio of services, but we, especially, cater to the needs of our customers that love to budget, to have control, as well as like to have privacy and security.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s those privacy and security aspects that he thinks might give Recharge an edge, going forward, as pre-payment often affords greater privacy with some services.\n\nIn a statement, Bas Janssen, senior banker, digital and consumer clients, ABN AMRO, said: \u201cWe see great promise in Recharge\u2019s growth trajectory as they broaden their reach within the global prepaid payments space.\u201d",

And some are very unhappy about it. Meanwhile, Bench claims that \u201cthe only way that they can get their data at all is to opt into giving Employer.com permission to access their data, because the only other entity that currently has that data to begin with no longer exists and is in active bankruptcy proceedings.\u201d\n\nDollars and cents\n\nFloat Financial, an expense management and corporate card startup focused on the Canadian market, has raised $50 million in a Series B funding round. The Toronto-based fintech likens itself to U.S.-based fintech giants Brex and Ramp but says it is different in that its sole focus is on Canadian SMBs.\n\nAt 24 years old, Pryce Yebesi already has one exit: selling his crypto invoicing company Utopia Labs to Coinbase for an undisclosed amount. On Monday, Yebesi announced the launch of his new company, Open Ledger, which embeds automated accounting software into products that enterprises and small businesses already use. He\u2019s already raised $3 million in a round led by Kindred Ventures and Blank Ventures.\n\nFocused primarily on cross-border payments for merchants across Asia and the Middle East, NomuPay has raised $37 million in funding at a $200 million valuation to expand its business.\n\nFinancial services firm Moody\u2019s has agreed to acquire Cape Analytics, a geospatial AI startup, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nClearwater Analytics, a company developing accounting, compliance, and risk reporting tools for asset managers, has agreed to acquire investment management platform Enfusion for $1.5 billion.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re writing\n\nRobinhood has agreed to fork out $45 million to settle an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over several alleged violations, including one related to this 2021 hack.\n\nAs digital payments morph into strategic assets, India is offering a template for other nations seeking to reduce dependence on Western payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard.\n\nGroww, India\u2019s largest retail stockbroker, is preparing to file for an IPO in 10 to 12 months, seeking a valuation between $6 billion and $8 billion, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.\n\nHigh-interest headlines\n\nIn HR software news, Buk, a Santiago, Chile-based human resources software provider, raised $50 million in Series B round funding at a valuation of about $850 million. That\u2019s up from the $417 million valuation it had achieved in 2021.\n\nToronto-based Humi has been acquired by fellow HR software company Employment Hero, as the Australian company seeks \u201cto gain a foothold in Canada.\u201d\n\nFintech giant Plaid told TechCrunch it is planning to open an office in Raleigh, North Carolina. Headquartered in San Francisco, Plaid now employs over 1,000 people and has additional offices in New York; Washington, D.C.; London; and Amsterdam. A spokesperson told TC that \u201cRaleigh is the next step of expanding Plaid\u2019s footprint to meet rising demand for its technology as the financial services sector moves increasingly online.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading. We\u2019ll see you again next week!",

    "raw_text": "CES 2025 is winding down\n\nAs CES comes to a close, let\u2019s take a look back at all the big announcements and reveals we\u2019ve seen throughout the conference.\n\nPress day started off strong with announcements from Nvidia, Samsung, and Toyota. We saw some weird and innovative gadgets on the show floor like a fun stringless electric instrument that certainly won\u2019t replace guitars anytime soon, a security system that shoots paintballs at intruders, and some super fun form factors from Lenovo. We saw a real autonomous vehicle moment manifest this year \u2014 and even took a ride in a Zoox robotaxi.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to have more coverage over the weekend, so stay tuned as the show wraps up!\n\nWhere are all the US automakers at CES?\n\nIndustry watchers have for years claimed that CES has turned into an auto show, maybe even the most important auto show of the year. But TechCrunch\u2019s Kirsten Korosec couldn\u2019t help but notice that not one American automaker could be found at this year\u2019s event, unless you count VW Group\u2019s U.S. spinoff Scout Motors. Several Chinese automakers filled that void, notably Zeekr, the EV brand owned by China\u2019s Geely Holdings.\n\nWhat\u2019s the reasoning behind their absence? Well, it could be attributed to the normal product cycle, which in the automotive industry tends to be much longer than other consumer electronics. Regardless, walking the floor of West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center \u2014 where virtually all vehicle tech can be found \u2014 the lack of U.S. automakers is certainly notable.\n\nSpotted at CES 2025: Cruise co-founder and former CEO, Kyle Vogt\n\nSpend enough time in the Las Vegas Convention Center and you\u2019ll run into the most interesting people.\n\nFor instance, while I was checking out the Waymo booth I saw none other than Kyle Vogt, the co-founder and former CEO of Cruise who launched a new robot company last year called the Bot Company. Vogt told me he always enjoys discovering new and interesting startups at CES. Take notice startup founders: you never know who might be looking at your tech.\n\nI also heard from a few folks that Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe and Wassym Bensaid, who heads up software development, were spotted walking around the show.",

    "raw_text": "Seven-year-old electric vehicle startup Canoo has filed for bankruptcy and will \u201ccease operations immediately.\u201d The company is liquidating its assets in a Chapter 7 proceeding in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court.\n\nThe company said in a press release published late Friday that it was \u201cin discussions with foreign sources of capital\u201d that proved unsuccessful and also singled out an inability to secure funding from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Program Office, which has been on a lending spree in the waning days of the Biden administration.\n\nCanoo said in its bankruptcy filing (and the filings for its subsidiaries) that it owes money to hundreds of creditors and that it has more than $164 million in total liabilities. It claimed around $126 million in assets.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing comes just a few weeks after Canoo furloughed the remainder of its workers and idled its factory in Oklahoma. The company struggled throughout 2024 to get more than a few of its electric vans into the hands of prospective customers and suffered numerous executive departures. It had just $700,000 in the bank in mid-November.\n\nCanoo is the latest EV startup to go bankrupt after merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) as a shortcut to going public. Electric Last Mile Solutions was the first in June 2022. But since then, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, Proterra, Lion Electric, and Arrival all filed for different levels of bankruptcy protection in their various home countries. (Canoo bought Arrival\u2019s assets out of insolvency in 2024, though it\u2019s unclear if it ever put any of it to use.)\n\nCanoo announced plans to merge with SPAC Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. in August 2020 and went public that following December, raising around $600 million. In the years since it went public, the company made a small number of its bubbly electric vans and handed them over to partners \u2014 some paying \u2014 willing to trial the vehicles. The U.S. Postal Service, Department of Defense, and NASA all have or had Canoo vehicles.\n\nAt one point, the company even courted Walmart, which agreed to purchase as many as 10,000 EVs from Canoo in 2022. But the deal was essentially nonbinding and bore little risk for the retail giant.\n\nCanoo was founded in late 2017 by a splinter group of executives who were fed up with the drama surrounding the other EV startup where they worked at the time, Faraday Future. Originally called Evelozcity, those executives developed a modular electric vehicle platform that could power cabins in multiple shapes and sizes, and utilized advanced technology like a steer-by-wire system.\n\nThe ideas inside Canoo were attractive enough that the startup at one point was in talks with Apple, which was interested in a potential investment or even acquisition as a way to boost the tech giant\u2019s own secretive electric car project. Former CTO and at one point CEO of Canoo, Ulrich Kranz, went on to help run Apple\u2019s car project before it was disbanded in 2024.\n\nBut Canoo underwent numerous pivots after it went public and gained a new chairman and CEO in Tony Aquila, who had invested in the company prior to the merger.\n\nA serial entrepreneur, Aquila immediately refocused Canoo away from selling to consumers and prioritized commercial fleets. On his watch, Canoo repeatedly changed plans on whether it would build its own electric vehicles or outsource the work. At one point, Canoo announced it was moving its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas \u2014 the home of Walmart \u2014 but then never really followed through. Instead, the company spent years trying to stand up multiple manufacturing facilities in Oklahoma.\n\nAquila\u2019s own financial firm appeared to benefit from his post atop the company. In 2023, Canoo spent double its meager revenue to pay for the use of its corporate jet. Canoo also rented office space from Aquila\u2019s firm, according to regulatory filings.\n\nIt was also Aquila\u2019s firm that kept Canoo alive in recent months. The firm loaned Canoo a few million dollars to keep the lights on dating back to October. Those loans were secured by a \u201cfirst priority lien and security interest\u201d on the equipment located at Canoo\u2019s Oklahoma City facility.\n\nSigns of a bankruptcy were bubbling up all week. Reddit users noticed that the company\u2019s billboard outside its office in Justin, Texas, had been taken down. Multiple employees who were on furlough told TechCrunch that they received official termination notices. Some people who had placed $100 deposits when the company was still planning on selling to regular customers had started to get refunds.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information about Canoo\u2019s total creditors, assets, and liabilities.",

    "raw_text": "Chinese AI lab DeepSeek provoked the first Silicon Valley freak-out of 2025 after releasing open versions of AI models that compete with the best technology OpenAI, Meta, and Google have to offer.\n\nDeepSeek claims to have built its models highly efficiently and quickly (though some are skeptical of these claims), and is providing these models at a fraction of the price American AI companies charge. The development has rattled not only tech giants but the highest levels of the U.S. government, which fear that China is pulling ahead in the AI arms race.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a lot of AI labs have war rooms going on right now,\u201d said Robert Nishihara, the co-founder of AI infrastructure startup Anyscale, in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nThe rise of DeepSeek marks an inflection point for Silicon Valley\u2019s AI landscape. AI CEOs, founders, researchers, and investors tell TechCrunch that DeepSeek\u2019s models have major implications for American AI policy. Moreover, these experts say, the models serve as an indicator of the accelerating rate of AI progress.\n\n\u201cOf course [DeepSeek] was over-hyped,\u201d said Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, an assistant professor at NYU\u2019s Center for Data Science, in an interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s still very interesting, and there\u2019s a lot we can take from it.\u201d\n\nNew ways to get AI thinking\n\nOne of DeepSeek\u2019s key innovations in creating its R1 model was \u201cpure reinforcement learning,\u201d a trial-and-error approach, according to Workera CEO and Stanford adjunct lecturer Kian Katanforoosh.\n\nKatanforoosh compared DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough to a kid figuring out not to touch a hot plate by accidentally burning themselves.\n\n\u201c[A kid] might touch a hot plate, get burned, and quickly learn not to do it again,\u201d Katanforoosh said via text. \u201cThat\u2019s pure reinforcement learning \u2014 learning from trial and error based on feedback [\u2026] DeepSeek\u2019s method is all about letting the model learn through experience alone.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek seems to have relied more heavily on reinforcement learning than other cutting edge AI models. OpenAI also used reinforcement learning techniques to develop o1, which the company revealed weeks before DeepSeek announced R1. OpenAI\u2019s upcoming o3 model achieves even better performance using largely similar methods, but also additional compute, the company claims.\n\nReinforcement learning represents one of the most promising ways to improve AI foundation models today, according to Katanforoosh. The term \u201cfoundation models\u201d generally refers to AI models trained on massive amounts of data, like images and text from the web. It seems likely that other AI labs will continue to push the limits of reinforcement learning to improve their AI models, especially given the success of DeepSeek.\n\nJust a few months ago, AI companies found themselves struggling to boost the performance of their foundation models. But the success of methods such as reinforcement learning and others, like supervised fine-tuning and test-time scaling, indicate that AI progress may be picking back up.\n\n\u201cR1 has given me a lot more confidence in the pace of progress staying high,\u201d said Nathan Lambert, a researcher at Ai2, in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nA turning point for AI policy\n\nR1, which can be downloaded and run on any machine that meets the hardware requirements, matches or beats o1 on a number of AI benchmarks. While it\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve seen the performance gap narrow between \u201cclosed\u201d models like that of OpenAI and openly available models, the speed with which DeepSeek did it has taken the industry aback.\n\nThis may push the U.S. to increase its investment in open, or even fully open source, AI in order to compete with China. Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), tells TechCrunch that DeepSeek proves just how \u201cwrongheaded\u201d the regulatory rationale of the last two years has been.\n\n\u201cFor AI, I think this just shows us that [the United States] is not alone in our technical capability,\u201d Casado said in an interview. \u201cVery competitive solutions can come from anywhere, but in particular, China. Rather than hampering U.S. innovation, we should invest strongly in it. Open source does not in some way enable China. In fact, disallowing our companies from doing open source means that our technology doesn\u2019t proliferate as much.\u201d\n\nCasado seemed to be referring to former President Biden\u2019s recently repealed AI executive order and the vetoed California bill SB 1047, both of which a16z aggressively opposed. a16z has argued both measures prioritized preventing \u201coutlandish\u201d AI doomsday scenarios over American innovation. More broadly, Silicon Valley generally had success tamping down the \u201cAI doom movement\u201d in 2024. The real concern around AI, a16z and others have repeatedly said, is America losing its competitive edge to China.\n\nThat scenario seems much more tangible in light of DeepSeek\u2019s rise.\n\nNot for nothing, a16z is heavily invested in many of the open AI world\u2019s largest players, including Databricks, Mistral, and Black Forest Labs. The VC firm may also play an outsized role advising the Trump administration on AI. Former a16z partner Sriram Krishnan is now Trump\u2019s senior policy advisor for AI.\n\nPresident Trump said on Monday that DeepSeek should be a \u201cwakeup call\u201d for American AI companies, while praising the Chinese AI lab for its open approach. That lines up pretty closely with a16z\u2019s stance on AI.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek R1 is AI\u2019s Sputnik moment,\u201d said a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen in a post on X, referencing the launch of the Soviet Union\u2019s Earth-orbiting spacecraft decades ago that pushed the U.S. to seriously invest in its space program.\n\nThe rise of DeepSeek also appears to have changed the mind of open AI skeptics, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Just last year, Schmidt expressed concern about the proliferation of Western open AI models around the globe. But in an op-ed published Tuesday, Schmidt said DeepSeek\u2019s rise marks a \u201cturning point\u201d in the global AI race, and called for further investment in American open AI.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nIt\u2019s important not to overstate DeepSeek\u2019s accomplishments.\n\nFor example, some analysts are skeptical of DeepSeek\u2019s claim that it trained one of its frontier models, DeepSeek V3, for just $5.6 million \u2014 a pittance in the AI industry \u2014 using roughly 2,000 older Nvidia GPUs. The Chinese AI lab did not sprout up overnight, after all, and DeepSeek reportedly has a stockpile of more than 50,000 more capable Nvidia Hopper GPUs.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s models are also flawed. According to a test by information-reliability organization NewsGuard, R1 provides inaccurate answers or non-answers 83% of the time when asked about news-related topics. A separate test found that R1 refuses to answer 85% of prompts related to China, possibly a consequence of the government censorship to which AI models developed in the country are subject.\n\nThen, there are the claims of IP theft. OpenAI says that it has evidence that DeepSeek used its AI models to train its own, using a process called distillation. If true, this would be a violation of OpenAI\u2019s terms, and would also make DeepSeek\u2019s accomplishments less impressive. For example, Berkeley researchers recently created a distilled reasoning model for just $450. (Of course, OpenAI is currently being sued by a number of parties for allegedly committing copyright infringement in training its own models.)\n\nStill, DeepSeek moved the needle with more efficient models \u2014 and it innovated. Lambert noted that, unlike o1, R1 reveals its \u201cthinking process\u201d to users. Lambert has observed that some users trust or believe AI reasoning models more when they see their internal process, during which they \u201cexplain their work.\u201d\n\nNow, we\u2019ll have to see how America\u2019s policymakers, and AI labs, respond.",

    "raw_text": "French startup Hyperline wants to build the next-generation Chargebee. Over the past two years, the startup has built a new billing platform that can be used for recurring subscriptions, one-off purchases, usage-based billing, and more.\n\nHyperline raised an initial \u20ac4 million funding round from Index Ventures back in 2023 ($4.1 million at today\u2019s exchange rate). And Index Ventures is doubling down on this investment as it is investing another $10 million in the startup.\n\nWhile billing seems like a straightforward issue, it becomes a tedious problem once you start scaling. \u201cWith billing, what\u2019s time-consuming is really the day-to-day operations. Every day, when you have more than 200 or 300 customers, someone has to go and check that everything is correct,\u201d founder and CEO Lucas B\u00e9dout told TechCrunch.\n\nSometimes, pricing isn\u2019t right. Other times, you forgot to add some items to the invoice or the client is asking for a partial reimbursement. And, of course, automatic payments fail fairly regularly for one reason or another.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we said to ourselves, we\u2019ll look at the current tools like Chargebee, and we\u2019ll do a little better than them. Except that 20% better is nice, but everything has changed so much that now it\u2019s just different. Now, people are looking for automation, they don\u2019t want to manually process invoices, send reminders, create quotes, etc.\u201d B\u00e9dout said.\n\nIn addition to subscription management, Hyperline has added other pricing models. For instance, clients can set custom pricing on the fly or add some usage-based component so that customers pay for what they use. Hyperline also handles invoices directly.\n\nAnd when it\u2019s time to pay, Hyperline doesn\u2019t process payments directly but takes care of that part for you. \u201cWe manage the entire value chain except payments \u2026 However, we do something that\u2019s pretty cool about payments. We position ourselves as an orchestrator. Our customers don\u2019t use payment processors directly,\u201d B\u00e9dout said.\n\nInstead of juggling between different tabs to interact with Stripe, GoCardless, Airwallex, or another payment processor, Hyperline acts as the interface to interact with these payment providers. It makes it easier to use multiple payment providers depending on the country or the payment method.\n\nCustomers usually get started with the web interface. They connect Hyperline to their CRM so that sales teams can create quotes directly from the CRM. They also connect the platform with the accounting software to process invoices and reconciliate payments.\n\nBut Hyperline offers an API as well, which can be particularly useful to sync events directly from a data warehouse for usage-based billing.\n\nThere are currently 14 people working for Hyperline, but the company expects to grow to 25 employees in the near future. Clients include Lokki, Malou, ScorePlay, Gladia, and Formance.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our customers today generate between \u20ac3 and \u20ac10 million in revenue,\u201d B\u00e9dout said. But Hyperline already thinks it can work with bigger companies that handle a large volume of invoices. That will require working with integration companies. And it\u2019s something that Hyperline is already testing.",

    "raw_text": "The number of machine identities is booming thanks to the growth of cloud and AI \u2014 and it\u2019s posing real security problems by giving hackers way more entry points than ever before. For example, a 2023 hack of authentication app Okta was caused by exploiting a service account while in 2024, Microsoft disclosed a major hack based on an old test account.\n\nToken Security\u2019s creation was sparked by exactly this kind of security risk: At a previous job, Itamar Apelblat found that an old service account for contractors still had full access across the entire organization. When Apelblat, now CEO of Token Security, told his friend and now CTO Ido Shlomo about the incident, they agreed that tackling the proliferation of these kind of non-human accounts was critical.\n\nToken Security, which emerged from stealth earlier this year and was founded in 2023, has now raised $20 million in Series A funding, the startup told TechCrunch. Notable Capital (formerly GGV Capital) led the round, with participation from TLV Partners and executives from Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Check Point, bringing Token\u2019s total funding to $27 million.\n\nToken Security says its platform looks across a company\u2019s entire tech stack to automatically pinpoint machine identities and who is responsible for them, helping customers catch potential breaches before they can happen. The startup, which told TechCrunch it counts HPE as one of its customers, says most incidents it has helped prevent involved credentials that were outdated or had excessive internal access.\n\nA key factor driving growth in machine identity security is that these kinds of accounts can be significantly more vulnerable to hackers than human ones. After all, a human who leaves a company typically has a clear offboarding process for their login credentials. But accounts created on the fly for specific projects, or that are meant to be shared by various contractors, don\u2019t go through those kinds of processes nearly as often.\n\n\u201cHackers don\u2019t break in; they log in,\u201d Apelblat told TechCrunch. \u201cEnterprises have done a good job securing human identities with things like multi-factor authentication, but automated systems are different.\u201d\n\nThe startup\u2019s co-founders met at Israel\u2019s Unit 8200 military intelligence unit, a prolific source of cybersecurity startup founders like those at Wiz, Snyk, and Apiiro, to name a few.\n\nApelblat worked on defensive security at the unit while Shlomo led work against nation-state actors on the offensive side \u2014 that is, actually getting into an enemy country\u2019s tech to gather intelligence or disrupt their operations.\n\n\u201cItamar and I met 16 years ago when I helped him tie his bootlaces on our first day being recruited into Unit 8200,\u201d Shlomo told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty much inseparable since then, going through army service, university, and entrepreneurial ventures together.\u201d\n\nMachine identity security is a hot field in cyber. Last year, Israel\u2019s Oasis emerged out of stealth with $40 million to tackle similar issues. The biggest deal in the space also happened in 2024 when Israel\u2019s CyberArk acquired U.S. firm Venafi for $1.54 billion.\n\nToken Security says it\u2019s using its new funding to relocate its headquarters from Israel to the United States, with Apelblat moving there next month. (The U.S. has a much bigger enterprise security market than Israel.) The company also plans to use the funding to expand its platform\u2019s AI security capabilities and grow its executive team, it told TechCrunch.",

    "raw_text": "Serial entrepreneur and former recording artist Victor D. Lombard, also known as DIVINE, announced this week the launch of a new company, in partnership with RAKIM, one of hip-hop\u2019s most influential emcees.\n\nThe company is called Notes, a fintech specifically for independent urban musicians and creators. It provides the knowledge and tools to help artists manage their careers \u2014 such as providing resources to help them apply for loans or access credit scores. It provides financial literacy and music business education by offering multimedia courses, step-by-step guides on financial management and how to monetize music. It also has a feature that lets artists write lyrics and connect with their peers on the app.\n\nNotes has a \u201cdigital passport\u201d feature that lets users track credit scores, access loans, and budget tools. The company partners with lenders and creditors and earns a commission on referral fees when users apply for loans through the platform.\n\nThe app, currently in beta, has AI tools, including an AI voice assistant in RAKIM\u2019s voice. It is hoping to launch fully at the end of February.\n\nChatting with TechCrunch, DIVINE said he was inspired to launch this company alongside RAKIM because of his firsthand experience dealing with the indie urban music scene and the hardship that comes when trying to fund a career. It\u2019s well-documented, through movies, profiles, and music itself, that breaking into the music industry is hard and expensive. For every big-named artist that hits the charts, there are thousands simply struggling to get by.\n\n\u201cThe music industry, as it stands, is structured to take advantage of artists through exploitative contracts and limited financial resources, forcing them into predatory deals just to survive,\u201d he said. Having spent the past 10 years building fintech companies, he also said he\u2019s come to view technology as a great equalizer, a way to redistribute control back to artists and creators. DIVINE previously founded fintech BLAK, which focused on serving underbanked communities, and built Solvent, a neobank also for underserved communities.\n\nSo he thought of Notes, to allow musicians to educate themselves, fund their own projects, and build careers on their own terms. He said now is a good time for this product because indie artists and creators are becoming more powerful and influential, yet still lack a lot of financial support.\n\nDIVINE then pitched the company to RAKIM\u2019s team as a way to partner, and \u201cit became an even more powerful force for change,\u201d DIVINE said.\n\nRAKIM was part of the hip-hop group Eric B. & RAKIM, which made waves during the golden age of hip-hop during the 80s. Their album \u201cPaid in Full\u201d was listed as one of the Greatest Albums of All Time by Rolling Stone in 2020 as it was one of the first albums to use funk samples and influenced the flow and lyricism of rappers to come.\n\nDIVINE says he\u2019s known RAKIM for 20 years and always admired him for \u201cstaying true to his artists and principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I started ideating Notes, I knew it had to be more than just a fintech platform, it had to be a movement rooted in the values of empowerment and cultural authenticity,\u201d DIVINE continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why it made perfect sense to bring RAKIM on board.\u201d\n\nThe partnership sees RAKIM come on as a co-founder and as an advisory board member. RAKIM\u2019s son, Tahmell Griffin, also holds an executive position at the company.\n\nRight now, the company is self-funded, but DIVINE said the company is seeking a pre-seed round. Notes offers freemium and premium subscription memberships. It seeks to make money from its subscription models and referral fees. He says this company is the culmination of his music and technological journey.\n\n\u201cI want Notes to shift the narrative from artists being exploited by record labels to artists owning their financial future and career success,\u201d DIVINE said. \u201cIf an artist can use Notes to get funding for their next album, learn how to run their music career as a business, and leverage community collaboration for growth, then we\u2019ve succeeded.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "There are a number of projects now underway that are focused on developing a video-first app for the open source social network Bluesky. However, one stands out from the rest: An upcoming app called Reelo isn\u2019t building on top of the Bluesky social network, as so many others are, but is building on the underlying AT Protocol that Bluesky uses. This allows it to differentiate itself with a broader feature set that will include support for longer videos, filters, effects, a music library, and, eventually, livestreaming.\n\nMany apps in this space \u2014 like Bluescreen, Videos for Bluesky, and Skylight \u2014 are constrained by Bluesky\u2019s limitations. As Bluesky was originally designed to compete with X (formerly Twitter), it doesn\u2019t have a feature set comparable to an app like TikTok.\n\nThese limitations make room for a new type of video app powered by the AT Protocol that could interoperate with Bluesky, as Reelo does, but can also stand on its own.\n\nOther Bluesky video apps work as a layer on top of Bluesky\u2019s platform, explains Reelo\u2019s developer, Jo\u00e3o Davi S. N., based in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. That means they lack key features that would allow them to compete more directly with TikTok, such as creator tools and monetization.\n\nLike other developers, Jo\u00e3o Davi initially tested the idea of building a video app for Bluesky, too. But he quickly found that it wasn\u2019t what he had in mind.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished the first prototype using Bluesky technology, I said, \u2018OK, this is crap. I can do nothing with this,\u2019\u201d he says. After all, Jo\u00e3o Davi points out, it was more than uploading video that made TikTok work.\n\n\u201cIt was music, effects, [and] a variety of capabilities,\u201d he says. \u201cCreating the video, posting the video is definitely not the most important thing. It\u2019s making videos that catch attention.\u201d\n\nTo address this, Jo\u00e3o Davi decided to work on a video app based on the AT Protocol, like Bluesky, but one that has its own back end, code base, and lexicon. (The latter he says refers to how the code dictates how the app\u2019s view is delivered.)\n\nThis choice allows Reelo to support videos of up to three minutes long \u2014 longer than Bluesky \u2014 and later will allow for livestreaming. By comparison, Bluesky and other third-party video apps built on top of Bluesky are limited to Bluesky\u2019s one-minute video support (unless the company changes that in the future).\n\nAs a sole developer with a separate business funding his efforts, he expects it will be March before he launches Reelo to the public. (Jo\u00e3o Davi has already had some investor interest, which could speed up efforts, but nothing is confirmed as of yet.)\n\nReelo features a swipeable vertical video feed with familiar interaction buttons for liking, commenting, sharing, and more. To store user data, Reelo will run its own PDS (personal data server), but technical users can set up their own PDS, just as they can for Bluesky.\n\nThe app will interoperate with Bluesky so users can find their friends, but posting Reelo videos back to Bluesky could be an optional step \u2014 like a checkbox in the app\u2019s user interface. (When cross-posting, one-minute videos could be published directly to Bluesky, but longer videos would need to be an embed.)\n\nAlso like Bluesky, Reelo could offer multiple custom feeds, including one featuring Bluesky videos, another for Reelo videos, and various topical feeds for things like Music, Dance, and more.\n\nTo monetize the app, Jo\u00e3o Davi is considering both ads and subscriptions, where revenue could be shared with creators. Premium plans may include things like livestreaming support and higher-quality video, but nothing is determined as of yet.\n\nHowever, Jo\u00e3o Davi intends to make the split fair to creators. \u201cI only need money to pay [for] the servers and whoever is working. More than that, it\u2019s like, \u2018What I do with this money?\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nReelo isn\u2019t yet available but will launch a sign-up for beta testers early this year.\n\nCorrection: Jo\u00e3o Davi lives in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, not Bras\u00edlia. This was updated after publication.",

    "raw_text": "French startup Karmen has secured a small funding round so that it can improve its instant financing products. The company offers short-term loans to small companies facing a working capital crunch.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u20ac9 million equity-and-debt round ($9.4 million at today\u2019s exchange rates) with Seventure Partners buying a stake in the small startup. Financi\u00e8re Arbevel and Bpifrance are complementing the round with some debt.\n\nThe startup isn\u2019t the only company operating in this space that could be described as instant financing for SMEs. French competitors include Silvr, Defacto, Unlimitd, and Hero.\n\nRevenue-based financing has become a hot vertical because banks and traditional financial institutions struggle to address SMEs at scale. It\u2019s a highly fragmented market with small margins. That\u2019s why tech startups are trying to fill that financing gap with a data-driven approach.\n\nToday\u2019s news comes just a few months after Karmen secured a \u20ac100 million debt vehicle that serves as the basis for the company\u2019s short-term loans. Six months later, it seems like quite a few companies are now relying on Karmen to fix their cashflow issues.\n\nAccording to the company, around 600 companies have used it to buy inventory, pay suppliers, finance paid acquisition campaigns, and more. Loans range from \u20ac20,000 to \u20ac3 million, from two months to 24 months.\n\nOn average, the typical Karmen client borrows \u20ac200,000 with a six-month term. But there\u2019s a wide diversity of financing options. The smallest customers generate only \u20ac300,000 in annual turnover (those are most likely one-person businesses), while Karmen\u2019s largest customer generates \u20ac160 million in revenue per year.\n\nMore importantly, Karmen says it has attracted some loyal customers, claiming that 80% of its customers contact Karmen several times per year to unlock a new debt line. Clients include Maison Kitsun\u00e9, Balibaris, Les Raffineurs, and Alm\u00e9.\n\nMost companies contact Karmen directly, but the startup has a hybrid distribution strategy. It partners with other fintech companies so that they can offer Karmen financing products to their own clients. Some ERPs, e-commerce marketplaces, and business banks like Qonto already integrate with Karmen.\n\nThis embedded financing strategy represents 40% of Karmen\u2019s clients right now, says the company, adding that it hopes it can raise that figure to 75% of new clients by the end of 2025.\n\nWhile most companies repay their loans without any issue, companies can sometimes struggle to repay what they owe.\n\n\u201cThis is part of our job as a lender. But we limit these risks through our data-driven approach, which allows us to have very granular visibility into the financial and operational performance of our clients,\u201d Karmen co-founder and CEO Gabriel Thierry said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we are investing heavily in our risk assessment technology tool (thanks to AI) to strengthen this approach,\u201d he added. Hence, today\u2019s funding round.\n\nKarmen currently uses around 60 different financial metrics to score loan applications in near real time. It argues that its embedded strategy can also be leveraged to make smarter decisions \u2014 bank accounts, accounting software, ERPs, and invoicing tools hold valuable data on a company\u2019s overall performance.",

    "raw_text": "SuperOps, an Indian startup offering tools to help IT service providers and internal system administrators at enterprises, has raised $25 million in a Series C round that values it at $200 million post-money, as it plans to double down on AI.\n\nFor enterprises with remote teams, IT teams often struggle to provide real-time support \u2014 whether it is onboarding new employees or troubleshooting a problem. That\u2019s what managed service providers (MSPs) are usually employed to help with, but sometimes even these third parties need help. That is where SuperOps comes in.\n\nThe space is a crowded one, but SuperOps hopes to capture a share of the market by catering to small and medium-sized enterprises that do not have big IT budgets \u2014 think MSPs with about five to 50 technicians, annual revenue of $1 million to $20 million, and serving clients with headcounts of 500 to 5,000 employees. It competes with companies like Atera and NinjaOne, and offers professional services automation (PSA), a remote monitoring management (RMM) platform, network monitoring, IT documentation, and more.\n\n\u201cBecause we have an India advantage, we are able to give them [MSPs and IT teams] the support even if they pay us $100 \u2026 Doesn\u2019t matter how much they pay, we will help them,\u201d co-founder and CEO Arvind Parthiban (pictured above, left) told TechCrunch.\n\nHe added that SuperOps charges $1.5 per endpoint for tools that its competitors, like NinjaOne, charge $4 per endpoint.\n\n\u201cWe are not the cheapest vendor, but we are also not the most luxury vendor in the market. We are like OnePlus [and not Apple]; we push in very well,\u201d he said.\n\nParthiban co-founded SuperOps with Jayakumar Karumbasalam (CPO and CTO) in 2020 after spending over a decade at Freshworks and Zoho.\n\nOver the past year, SuperOps said it has tripled its customer base to 1,300 across 104 countries. The U.S., U.K., Europe, and Australia are its top four markets.\n\nThe all-equity Series C round comes more than a year after SuperOps raised a $12.4 million Series B and is being led by March Capital, with participation from existing investors Addition and Z47.\n\nLast year, the startup launched a GPT-powered AI assistant called Monica that analyzes MSPs\u2019 datasets to provide personalized insights and automate routine workflows. It is now planning to upgrade the bot to add a prediction and recommendation algorithm that analyzes tickets filed in the past to predict issues and propose solutions in advance. The new feature is expected to be available in a year.\n\nThe startup has also launched an endpoint management tool for IT teams with fewer resources. The tool, also powered by AI, provides intelligent alerting, automates maintenance activities such as patching and software updates, and prioritizes incidents. It\u2019s aimed at increasing the company\u2019s presence in the IT services market, which makes sense since internal IT teams already comprise 20% of SuperOps\u2019 customer base.\n\nWith the fresh cash, the startup plans to enter the midsized enterprise market, expand geographically to new regions, and expand its footprint in the U.S. It plans to open an office in London by the end of the year and expand to Latin America as well as Spain, Portugal, and Germany.\n\nSuperOps employs 200 people, of which 180 work in India and 10 in the U.S. It plans to hire more in the coming months as it seeks to increase revenue by 300% this year, Parthiban said.",

    "raw_text": "In May 2023, Ford triggered a transformation when the U.S. automaker locked in a deal to give owners of its EVs access to the Tesla Supercharger network.\n\nIn a stunning shift, automaker after automaker \u2014 from GM and Hyundai to Rivian and Mercedes \u2014 followed suit. By the end of 2023, nearly every major automaker had agreed to adopt Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard (NACS) and promised EV owners that adapters would soon be on their way.\n\nMany non-Tesla customers are still waiting. However, recent announcements from automakers may provide an electric lining of optimism.\n\nTechCrunch is tracking which brands have access to the Tesla Supercharging Network and will be updating this list.\n\nThe shift to the Tesla EV charging standard\n\nIn November 2022, Tesla shared its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America. At the time, every other automaker was using the Combined Charging Standard (CCS) in North America.\n\nMass adoption seemed unlikely at the time even though Tesla\u2019s charging network was considered far superior thanks to its robust and user-friendly design and the ease of paying for the EV juice.\n\nSix months later, Ford became the first to announce it would work with Tesla in a deal that would give its customers access to more than 12,000 Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. But it wasn\u2019t just about giving Ford EV owners access to a special adapter. Ford also committed to integrating its future EVs with NACS ports instead of CCS.\n\nRivian, GM, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid, and Stellantis followed.\n\nTesla charging FAQs\n\nIn the U.S. today, there are 36,499 NACS ports available publicly (although some of those might be from other EV charging companies that have adapted Tesla\u2019s standard), compared to around 16,925 CCS ports. That\u2019s despite federal dollars that have gone explicitly to the buildout of CCS chargers.\n\nFor EV owners stuck with a CCS port, they\u2019ll have to hold out for manufacturer-approved adapters. While there are some third-party adapters that claim to be compliant with certain safety and performance standards, like Lectron\u2019s Vortex Plug for $199, Tesla\u2019s website says such adapters are prohibited.\n\nA GM spokesperson told TechCrunch its adapters have been specifically designed to protect GM EV batteries while charging and that its vehicle warranty doesn\u2019t cover damage to vehicle parts resulting from the use of non-GM approved adapters.\n\nIn late August, Tesla posted on X that it had ramped up production of adapters. That statement, combined with GM\u2019s announcement, could mean that even more non-Tesla EVs will be pulling up to Supercharger stations soon. They\u2019ll all have to download the Tesla app so they can pay for charging.\n\nTesla supercharging access checklist\n\nFord\n\nCertain Ford customers officially gained access to Tesla Superchargers in February, but ongoing supply constraints have delayed the delivery of free fast-charging adapters for most customers (although Ford says the delays have affected \u201csome\u201d customers).\n\nCurrent owners of the Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning who have yet to order their adapter can do so through their Ford Pass app. The deadline to apply for a free adapter is September 30.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nAs of September 2024, GM has finally updated the software on its Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC EVs so customers can use Tesla\u2019s Superchargers. If they want access soon, they need to purchase a \u201cGM approved\u201d adapter through their app for $225.\n\nGM wouldn\u2019t say how long shipping would take. A GM spokesperson said the company already has an inventory of the adapters and that it\u2019s worked with multiple suppliers to manufacture the approved NACS DC fast-charging adapters.\n\nFrom 2025 onward, GM\u2019s EVs will be built with the NACS charge port.\n\nHyundai Motor Group\n\nThe South Korean automaker has made several moves to give EV owners access to NACS chargers in the coming year.\n\nKia announced in September its plans to give EV owners access to NACS chargers starting January 15, 2025. They used the announcement as something of a promotion, offering customers who buy a new 2024 EV6 or 2024 or 2025 EV9 SUV from September 4, 2024 a free adapter mailed to them in early 2025, if there\u2019s enough supply. Existing Kia EV6, EV9, and Niro EV customers who took delivery before September 4 will have to buy an adapter from a dealer \u201cat a later date.\u201d\n\nBut for those who don\u2019t want to bother with an adapter, Kia shared some news at the LA Auto Show in November. Both the 2025 EV6 and 2026 EV9 GT will be manufactured with a NACS plug. The EV6 is expected to go on sale in the first half of 2025, and the EV9 GT in the latter half of next year.\n\nThe 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9 and the 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 were also both presented with NACS plugs at the LA Auto Show and promise drivers access to Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network. But for customers who want a Hyundai EV sooner than that, the automaker said in December that it would send customers who bought or leased an EV before January 31 a free NACS adapter.\n\nLucid\n\nOwners of the Lucid Gravity SUV will get access to Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network on January 31, 2025. The Gravity is built standard with the NACS charge port.\n\nPeople who have already purchased the Lucid Air sedan, built with a CCS port, will get access via adapters to the Supercharger network in the second quarter.\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nMercedes-Benz said in January that its EVs will be able to access Tesla\u2019s network starting in February 2025. Mercedes is offering existing EV customers the ability to purchase an adapter made by Lectron for $185 through authorized dealerships. The automaker plans to roll out its first vehicles with factory-installed NACS ports later this year. Mercedes has not yet shared which models will come first.\n\nMercedes will add Tesla Supercharger locations to its charger map in the app, and the system will integrate with the automaker\u2019s Plug & Charge feature, which initiates charging as soon as the customer plugs in.\n\nNissan\n\nBeginning in late 2024, Nissan plans to give Ariya drivers access to Tesla\u2019s network through a NACS adapter. The automaker also said that in 2025, it will start offering EVs for the U.S. and Canadian markets with a NACS port.\n\nRivian\n\nEV startup Rivian officially got access to 15,000 Superchargers across North America on March 18, 2024. At the time, Rivian promised to begin sending adapters to customers starting in April. A Rivian spokesperson told TechCrunch the automaker began delivery this spring and continues to ship adapters as quickly as it receives them.\n\nAs of September 2024, Rivian said that customers who order a new vehicle will have an adapter shipped to them automatically when they take delivery. Customers will receive the adapter within seven to 10 business days. The EV-maker also promised that those who already own a Rivian and are still awaiting an adapter will receive one at no cost by the end of January 2025.\n\nVolvo (and Polestar)\n\nThe two Swedish car brands owned by China\u2019s Geely began offering their EV customers access to Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network at the end of October.\n\nVolvo said it will include a free NACS adapter for any customer who buys a 2025 EX90, EX40, or EC40. Existing Volvo EV owners will have to shell out $230 for an adapter, which they can buy from a dealership or service center.\n\nPolestar is also selling the adapter through its service centers. Both brands gave a mid-November date when they\u2019ll start shipping adapters. Volvo and Polestar are also updating their Android-powered infotainment software so drivers can search for Tesla Superchargers in the vehicle\u2019s navigation.\n\nTechCrunch will update the list as automakers gain official access.",

    "raw_text": "Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech!\n\nThis week, we\u2019re looking at just how much fintech startups raised in 2024, a slew of fundraising deals, Plaid\u2019s reported revenue growth last year, and more!\n\nTo get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important fintech stories delivered to your inbox every Tuesday at 8:00 a.m. PT, subscribe here.\n\nThe big story\n\nGlobal funding to fintech startups continues to decline. According to CB Insights\u2019 State of Fintech 2024 Report, fintech startups globally raised a combined $33.7 billion in funding last year \u2014 down 20% from the year before. Deal volume also dropped \u2014 by 17% to 3,580. But there are at least a couple of bright spots: The annual decline in funding was fintech\u2019s smallest in three years. Plus, funding rebounded to close the year strong, reaching $8.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 \u2014 up 11% compared to the 2024 third quarter. CB Insights also reported a 33% annual increase in median fintech deal size \u2014 to $4 million.\n\nDollars and cents\n\nLemFi, a London-based financial services platform designed for immigrants, raised $53 million in new funding, which it will use to fuel efforts to acquire more customers and further expand into more countries.\n\nRecharge, a key European player in online prepaid payments, has secured a \u20ac45 million debt facility with ABN AMRO to look at rolling up the market with a round of M&A, as well as moving into fintech-style services.\n\nFrench startup Hyperline wants to build the next-generation Chargebee. It raised an initial \u20ac4 million funding round from Index Ventures back in 2023 ($4.1 million at today\u2019s exchange rate). And Index Ventures is doubling down on this investment as it is investing another $10 million in the startup.\n\nBench, the accounting startup that imploded over the holidays, filed for bankruptcy in Canada on January 7 revealing massive debts, documents seen by TechCrunch show. The filings \u2014 one for Bench and another for 10Sheet, Bench\u2019s original name \u2014 show that Bench had $2.8 million in cash on hand by the end of its life but $65.4 million in liabilities. Charles Rollet does a deep dive here.\n\nMore fintech IPOs?! Trading platform eToro has reportedly filed confidentially for a U.S. IPO that could value the company at over $5 billion. Israel-based eToro, which competes with the likes of Robinhood, told TechCrunch it is \u201cnot commenting on IPO rumors.\u201d\n\nAmazon has agreed to acquire Indian buy now, pay later startup Axio, deepening its push into financial services in one of its fastest-growing markets.\n\nEx-SoftBank veteran Akshay Naheta\u2019s Switzerland-based startup, Distributed Technologies Research (DTR), is attempting to bridge the gap between traditional banking and blockchain technology, joining an army of companies trying to modernize the global payments infrastructure.\n\nBarclays\u2019 Rise is shutting down in 2025.\n\nPeople moves\n\nSynctera has hired its first CFO, Matias Pino.\n\nMark Fiorentino announced he\u2019s left Index Ventures to join Bain Capital as \u201cthe newest partner charged with helping to guide the next generation of growth-stage AI-native, vertical SaaS and fintech startups.\u201d\n\nHigh-interest headlines\n\nLast year was a good year for Plaid. Bloomberg reports that revenue at Plaid Inc., which provides infrastructure to connect fintechs and banks, spiked by over 25% last year.\n\nCryptocurrency-wallet provider Phantom Technologies raised $150 million in a funding round at a $3 billion valuation. Sequoia Capital and Paradigm co-led the round.\n\nThanks for reading. We\u2019ll see you again next week!",

    "raw_text": "While the adoption of IP (intellectual property) blockchain and tokenization of assets is still in its early stages, more creatives in the entertainment industry are embracing what is called \u201ctokenized storytelling.\u201d This approach enables fans to participate in story development, contributing elements \u2014 such as characters and plot \u2014 that can be tokenized and owned as digital assets.\n\nDavid S. Goyer \u2014 known for \u201cBlade,\u201d \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d trilogy, and \u201cFoundation\u201d \u2014 is the latest filmmaker and comic book writer to explore how blockchain technology can give his fans a voice in the creative process while also protecting IP.\n\nAnnounced on Tuesday, Goyer (pictured above) teamed up with Incention, a new entertainment platform utilizing Story\u2019s IP blockchain, to launch his new sci-fi franchise called \u201cEmergence.\u201d\n\nIncention, backed by a16z crypto, aims to give IP holders a platform to protect their work and engage with their audiences. The company was founded by Chase Rosenblatt (CEO) and Spencer Marell (COO), two tech entrepreneurs who believe traditional IP development is flawed and new and rising creatives are being overlooked.\n\n\u201cI was intrigued with the idea of using the broader community and the tokenization of these ideas,\u201d Goyer told TechCrunch. \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful about these platforms is that if you create something, regardless of what it is, whether it\u2019s a drawing, a short story, a t-shirt, it tracks your creation throughout all the subsequent mediums, and it creates a watermark, if you will, and it compensates you forever.\u201d\n\nStarting today, everyone is now welcome to collaborate on Emergence, the first IP to debut on Incention\u2019s platform. This includes writers who want to create their own narratives, artists with visions for characters or landscapes, and musicians who wish to contribute to the soundtrack.\n\nOnce a community-created idea receives enough votes and is approved, it becomes part of the official canon. Fans are rewarded with ownership, giving them a stake in the story\u2019s success.\n\nGoyer revealed to us details about Emergence, which is centered around a white hole known as the \u201cWhite Fountain\u201d that ejects thousands of mysterious relics throughout the galaxy that possess incredible power. Much like his previous projects, Goyer\u2019s new universe is carefully crafted and rich with intricate details and unique characters, yet also offers ample room for creative exploration.\n\nGoyer and a team of award-winning writers also created a \u201cWorld Bible\u201d or guide that outlines the themes, characters, and evolving plotlines of the story. For instance, it details the various types of relics (micro, macro, and mega relics) and introduces the various types of lifeforms, including advanced humans known as \u201cThe Kind.\u201d\n\nA few characters have been fully fleshed out as well, including Captain Skadi (featured in the image below), who, as a child, touched a macro-relic and inadvertently turned her entire world into glass, including her parents and siblings. There\u2019s also Darius, a service worker who travels the galaxy and witnesses \u201ca lot of weird shit,\u201d as Goyer puts it.\n\nBeyond what is contained in the World Bible, much of the story remains untold. Goyer intentionally leaves many questions unanswered about the universe, including the nature of the relics and their origins.\n\nAdditionally, Incention built an AI agent called \u201cAtlas\u201d to help Emergence collaborators generate ideas and answer questions about the world or specific characters to ensure accuracy. Atlas can also create videos and images.\n\nIn the future, Goyer mentioned that fans will have the opportunity to vote on certain aspects of the story, such as the fate of a character (whether they live or die) and the introduction of new characters into the universe. There will also be a leaderboard for tracking points, as well as the ability to invite and collaborate with others on the platform.\n\nThe possibility of Incention users being able to monetize content remains unclear. The company declined to comment.\n\nAlthough Incention may present exciting opportunities for fans to engage more deeply with influential sci-fi writers like Goyer, it\u2019s still too early to determine if others will be on board. Many creators prefer to maintain direct control over their IP and are generally resistant to adopting new technologies like blockchain and AI.\n\nGoyer remarked, \u201cIf anything, [Incention] is going to lower the barrier and allow people that might not have had a way to break in and make some money and get some recognition early on\u2026 Hopefully, based on my track record, that will create enough initial interest.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "A February 2024 ransomware attack on UnitedHealth-owned health tech company Change Healthcare stands as the largest data breach of health and medical data in U.S. history.\n\nChange Healthcare confirmed in January 2025 that its data breach affects approximately 190 million people in America, almost double the company\u2019s previous estimate.\n\nThe company said it has notified millions of individuals by mail that their personal and health information was stolen by cybercriminals, and published a separate public notice for anyone whose contact information could not be found.\n\nChange Healthcare processes billing and insurance for hundreds of thousands of hospitals, pharmacies and medical practices across the U.S. healthcare sector. As such, the company collects and stores vast amounts of highly sensitive medical data on patients in the United States. Following a series of corporate mergers and acquisitions, Change Healthcare became one of the biggest processors of U.S. health data, handling as many as half of all U.S. health transactions.\n\nHere\u2019s what has happened since the ransomware attack began.\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nFirst report of outages as security incident emerges\n\nIt seemed like an ordinary Wednesday afternoon, until it wasn\u2019t. The outage was sudden. On February 21, billing systems at doctors offices and healthcare practices stopped working, and insurance claims stopped processing. The status page on Change Healthcare\u2019s website was flooded with outage notifications affecting every part of its business, and later that day the company confirmed it was \u201cexperiencing a network interruption related to a cyber security issue.\u201d Clearly something had gone very wrong.\n\nIt turns out that Change Healthcare invoked its security protocols and shut down its entire network to isolate intruders it found in its systems. That meant sudden and widespread outages across the healthcare sector that relies on a handful of companies \u2014 like Change Healthcare \u2014 to handle healthcare insurance and billing claims for vast swathes of the United States. It was later determined that the hackers initially broke into the company\u2019s systems over a week earlier, on or around February 12.\n\nFebruary 29, 2024\n\nUnitedHealth confirms it was hit by ransomware gang\n\nAfter initially (and incorrectly) attributing the intrusion to hackers working for a government or nation-state, UnitedHealth later said on February 29 that the cyberattack was in fact the work of a ransomware gang. UnitedHealth said the gang \u201crepresented itself to us as ALPHV/BlackCat,\u201d a company spokesperson told TechCrunch at the time. A dark web leak site associated with the ALPHV/BlackCat gang also took credit for the attack, claiming to have stolen millions of Americans\u2019 sensitive health and patient information, giving the first indication of how many individuals this incident had affected.\n\nALPHV (aka BlackCat) is a known Russian-speaking ransomware-as-a-service gang. Its affiliates \u2014 contractors who work for the gang \u2014 break into victim networks and deploy malware developed by ALPHV/BlackCat\u2019s leaders, who take a cut of the profits collected from the ransoms collected from victims to get their files back.\n\nKnowing that the breach was caused by a ransomware gang changed the equation of the attack from the kind of hacking that governments do \u2014 sometimes to send a message to another government instead of publishing millions of people\u2019s private information \u2014 to a breach caused by financially motivated cybercriminals, who are likely to employ an entirely different playbook to get their payday.\n\nMarch 3-5, 2024\n\nUnitedHealth pays a ransom of $22 million to hackers, who then disappear\n\nIn early March, the ALPHV ransomware gang vanished. The gang\u2019s leak site on the dark web, which weeks earlier took credit for the cyberattack, was replaced with a seizure notice claiming that U.K. and U.S. law enforcement took down the gang\u2019s site. But both the FBI and U.K. authorities denied taking down the ransomware gang as they had attempted months earlier. All signs pointed to ALPHV running off with the ransom and pulling an \u201cexit scam.\u201d\n\nIn a posting, the ALPHV affiliate who carried out the hack on Change Healthcare claimed that the ALPHV leadership stole $22 million paid as a ransom and included a link to a single bitcoin transaction on March 3 as proof of their claim. But despite losing their share of the ransom payment, the affiliate said the stolen data is \u201cstill with us.\u201d UnitedHealth had paid a ransom to hackers who left the data behind and disappeared.\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nWidespread disruption across U.S. healthcare amid fears of data breach\n\nMeanwhile, weeks into the cyberattack, outages were still ongoing with many unable to get their prescriptions filled or having to pay cash out of pocket. Military health insurance provider TriCare said \u201call military pharmacies worldwide\u201d were affected as well.\n\nThe American Medical Association was saying there was little information from UnitedHealth and Change Healthcare about the ongoing outages, causing massive disruption that continued to ripple across the healthcare sector.\n\nBy March 13, Change Healthcare had received a \u201csafe\u201d copy of the stolen data that it had just days earlier paid $22 million for. This allowed Change to begin the process of poring through the dataset to determine whose information was stolen in the cyberattack, with the aim of notifying as many affected individuals as possible.\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nU.S. government ups its bounty to $10 million for information leading to ALPHV capture\n\nBy late March, the U.S. government said it was upping its bounty for information on key leadership of ALPHV/BlackCat and its affiliates.\n\nBy offering $10 million to anyone who can identify or locate the individuals behind the gang, the U.S. government seemed to hope that one of the gang\u2019s insiders would turn on their former leaders. It also could be seen as the U.S. realizing the threat of having a significant number of Americans\u2019 health information potentially published online.\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nContractor forms new ransom gang and publishes some stolen health data\n\nAnd then there were two \u2014 ransoms, that is. By mid-April, the aggrieved affiliate set up a new extortion racket called RansomHub, and since it still had the data that it stole from Change Healthcare, it demanded a second ransom from UnitedHealth. In doing so, RansomHub published a portion of the stolen files containing what appeared to be private and sensitive patient records as proof of their threat.\n\nRansomware gangs don\u2019t just encrypt files; they also steal as much data as possible and threaten to publish the files if a ransom isn\u2019t paid. This is known as \u201cdouble extortion.\u201d In some cases when the victim pays, the ransomware gang can extort the victim again \u2014 or, in others, extort the victim\u2019s customers, known as \u201ctriple extortion.\u201d\n\nNow that UnitedHealth was willing to pay one ransom, there was a risk that the healthcare giant would be extorted again. It\u2019s why law enforcement have long advocated against paying a ransom that allows criminals to profit from cyberattacks.\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nUnitedHealth says ransomware hackers stole health data on a \u201csubstantial proportion of people in America\u201d\n\nFor the first time, UnitedHealth confirmed on April 22 \u2014 more than two months after the ransomware attack began \u2014 that there was a data breach and that it likely affects a \u201csubstantial proportion of people in America,\u201d without saying how many millions of people that entails. UnitedHealth also confirmed it paid a ransom for the data but would not say how many ransoms it ultimately paid.\n\nThe company said that the stolen data includes highly sensitive information, including medical records and health information, diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging and care and treatment plans, and other personal information.\n\nGiven that Change Healthcare handles data on as many as half of everyone living in the United States, the data breach is likely to affect more than 100 million people at least. When reached by TechCrunch, a UnitedHealth spokesperson did not dispute the likely affected number but said that the company\u2019s data review was ongoing.\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\nUnitedHealth Group chief executive testifies that Change wasn\u2019t using basic cybersecurity\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly when your company has had one of the biggest data breaches in recent history, its chief executive is bound to get called to testify before lawmakers.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened with UnitedHealth Group (UHG) chief executive Andrew Witty, who on Capitol Hill admitted that the hackers broke into Change Healthcare\u2019s systems using a single set password on a user account not protected with multi-factor authentication, a basic security feature that can prevent password reuse attacks by requiring a second code sent to that account holder\u2019s phone.\n\nOne of the biggest data breaches in U.S. history was entirely preventable, was the key message. Witty said that the data breach was likely to affect about one-third of people living in America \u2014 in line with the company\u2019s previous estimates that the breach affects around as many people that Change Healthcare processes healthcare claims for.\n\nJune 20, 2024\n\nUHG starts notifying affected hospitals and medical providers what data was stolen\n\nIt took Change Healthcare until June 20 to begin formally notifying affected individuals that their information was stolen, as legally required under a law commonly known as HIPAA, likely delayed in part by the sheer size of the stolen dataset.\n\nThe company published a notice disclosing the data breach and said that it would begin notifying individuals it had identified in the \u201csafe\u201d copy of the stolen data. But Change said it \u201ccannot confirm exactly\u201d what data was stolen about each individual and that the information may vary from person to person. Change says it was posting the notice on its website, as it \u201cmay not have sufficient addresses for all affected individuals.\u201d\n\nThe incident was so big and complex that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stepped in and said that affected healthcare providers, whose patients are ultimately affected by the breach, can ask UnitedHealth to notify affected patients on their behalf, an effort seen at lessening the burden on smaller providers whose finances were hit amid the ongoing outage.\n\nJuly 29, 2024\n\nChange Healthcare begins notifying known affected individuals by letter\n\nThe health tech giant confirmed in late June that it would begin notifying those whose healthcare data was stolen in its ransomware attack on a rolling basis. That process began in late July.\n\nThe letters going out to affected individuals will most likely come from Change Healthcare, if not the specific healthcare provider affected by the hack at Change. The letter confirms what kinds of data was stolen, including medical data and health insurance information, and claims and payment information, which Change said includes financial and banking information.\n\nA spokesperson for UnitedHealth told TechCrunch that the data review was in its \u201cfinal stages.\u201d\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\nUnitedHealth confirms at least 100 million people affected by data breach\n\nIt took the health insurance giant more than eight months to announce, but it has now confirmed that the data breach affects more than 100 million individuals. The number of those affected is expected to rise, given some have received data breach notifications as recently as October. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported the updated number on its data breach portal on October 24.\n\nAs it stands, the data breach at Change Healthcare is now the largest digital theft of U.S. medical records, and one of the biggest data breaches in living history.\n\nDecember 16, 2024\n\nNew details about Change hack emerge in Nebraska lawsuit\n\nThe state of Nebraska filed a lawsuit against Change Healthcare in December, accusing the health tech giant of security failings that led to the massive breach of at least 100 million people in America. New details about the hack emerged in the state\u2019s complaint, including that the ALPHV hackers initially broke in using the stolen username and password of a \u201clow-level customer support employee,\u201d which wasn\u2019t protected with multi-factor authentication. The state\u2019s complaint also accuses Change Healthcare of having poorly segmented IT systems, which allowed the hackers to travel freely between servers once inside the company\u2019s firewall.\n\nUnitedHealth Group, which owns Change Healthcare, told TechCrunch that the company was still in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of notifying individuals affected by the data breach (the same thing it told us in July), suggesting that the number of Americans affected by the data breach will be far higher than the 100 million disclosed so far.\n\nJanuary 24, 2025\n\nChange Healthcare says 190 million people in America affected by data breach\n\nOn a Friday evening almost a year after the cyberattack, UnitedHealth confirmed that the number of people in America who had private health information stolen in the data breach stands at 190 million, more than half of the population of the United States. The healthcare insurance giant said it planned to notify the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of the updated figure, as required by law, at a later date.\n\nMillions of people are affected by the breach, even if they didn\u2019t have UnitedHealthcare insurance, given the massive amounts of medical data and billion transactions that Change Healthcare processes across the U.S. healthcare system every day.",

    "raw_text": "When it comes to the world of cybersecurity, identity is often thought of as a \u201cperimeter\u201d around an organization. So many breaches begin through techniques like password theft, phishing, and credential stuffing; ergo, securing the identities of not only users, but also applications and machines, is the key to securing the whole system.\n\nEasier said than done \u2014 as the recent security breach at the U.S. Treasury demonstrated. Now, Clutch Security \u2014 one of the startups building tools to focus on the space on non-human (machine) identity \u2014 is announcing $20 million in funding, underscoring the demand in the market to address the issue.\n\nSignalFire is leading this round with participation also from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Merlin Ventures, existing backers that invested in its previous $8.5 million seed round. Clutch said it would be using the funding for R&D, product development, and to expand its business development.\n\nClutch today has integrations with close to 60 infrastructure services, applications, and identity providers most popular with enterprises. It secures a variety of data that these use to interface with each other, including API keys, service accounts, \u201csecrets,\u201d tokens and other credentials. Clutch\u2019s platform provides services like network visibility, posture and risk management, and lifecycle management, via a zero-trust approach. There is scope to cover much more: The average number of machine identities in a typical large enterprise has ballooned in the last couple of years, from 320,000 in 2022 to 1 million in 2024, according to research from Venafi (a competitor of Clutch\u2019s).\n\nClutch\u2019s focus on perimeter breaches, by coincidence, came into existence at the moment when another perimeter was breached. The Tel Aviv startup was founded in October 2023, more or less on the heels of Israel getting attacked by Hamas and in turn going to war against it in Gaza.\n\nCEO Ofir Har-Chen \u2014 who co-founded Clutch with Sagi Haas and Tal Kimhi (pictured above; Har-Chen is far left) \u2014 said that building a company at that moment was a blessing and a curse. On one hand, people were very distracted and distressed by the events that were unfolding, and many were simply unavailable to work, as they were stepping into positions supporting the situation at hand, many joining up with the military. On the other hand, for those who were working, it definitely focused their minds.\n\nHe said the company struggled to hire anyone at first, taking on its first employees finally in February. But then, it built its first minimum-viable product within just three months. \u201cI would say that we probably have probably one of the best engineering teams in Israel, because all of them are veterans of in the space,\u201d he said. Har-Chen is among those veterans: He\u2019s spent 20 years working across a range of cybersecurity technical and executive roles, both within the Israeli government and in private firms. (Haas and Kimhi meanwhile are alums of Axonius, another cyber firm.)\n\nThe problem that Clutch decided to pursue, meanwhile, is \u201cone as old as time,\u201d Har-Chen continued. Service accounts in Windows Active Directory have been examples of where machine identities can be exploited by malicious hackers, and these have been in operation since 1994, he said. \u201cThere is nothing new here.\u201d But the advent of cloud computing and the explosion of software as a service as the primary way that applications are used, he added, \u201chas exacerbated the problem.\u201d\n\nAdd to this the entry of AI, and specifically AI agents, which have become the newest target for malicious hackers.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing the pendulum swing from the human being as the weakest link, to the non-human, or the machine,\u201d he said. \u201cAI agents are now being rapidly adopted in the enterprise, replacing manual tasks done by humans.\u201d He said he believes there will be a bigger influx now of attacks aiming to compromise these agents, \u201cjust a proliferation of attacks.\u201d\n\nClutch is far from the first company to identify the problems here. The crowded market includes the likes of Semperis, which last year raised at a $1 billion valuation to focus just on that legacy issue of Active Directory; Astrix Security, which raised $45 million this past December; Oasis, a buzzy Israeli startup that raised $40 million a year ago; CyberArk, which acquired machine-to-machine security firm Venafi for over $1.5 billion last year; Silverfort, which is taking a holistic approach to identity; and Token Security, which also raised $20 million days ago.\n\nThe speed with which Clutch is building is one reason why investors are especially interested in this startup over (or alongside) all of these others. \u201cWhat Clutch has achieved in such a short time is remarkable \u2013 they\u2019re not just building a groundbreaking platform, they\u2019re reshaping the entire industry,\u201d said Guru Chahal, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, in a statement. \u201cTheir work is already pushing cybersecurity forward in meaningful ways, and as enterprises start embracing agentic AI, I believe Clutch will be transformative.\u201d",

    "raw_text": "Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech!\n\nThis week we\u2019re looking at the story behind the sale of Divvy Homes, Ramp\u2019s new product, some notable fundraising deals, and more!\n\nTo get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important fintech stories delivered to your inbox every Tuesday at 8:00 a.m. PT, subscribe here.\n\nThe big story\n\nLast week, real estate fintech Divvy Homes announced that it was selling to Brookfield Properties for \u201ca total consideration\u201d of about $1 billion. At its height in 2021, the rent-to-own startup was valued at over $2 billion. On the surface, the outcome didn\u2019t seem terrible, given the number of proptech companies that have shut down (most recently, EasyKnock) altogether in recent years.\n\nHowever, digging deeper, we realized that the deal wasn\u2019t really so rosy for many shareholders. Because Divvy had taken out so much debt, including a $735 million debt financing in October of 2021, most of that $1 billion was going toward paying that back as well as funding transaction costs and \u201cliquidation preference to preferred shareholders.\u201d CEO and co-founder Adena Hefets stated in a letter to stakeholders viewed by TechCrunch that \u201ccommon shareholders nor holders of the Series FF preferred stock\u201d would not receive any consideration. Ouch.\n\nNo doubt Divvy was hurt by interest rates surging in 2022, but it had other problems too. There were a variety of complaints alleging that the company was not maintaining its properties and/or was evicting people while also charging higher-than-market rate rents. Was it a fire sale or not? Guess that depends on who you ask. But even Hefets herself admitted she was \u201cnot proud of the financial outcome.\u201d\n\nDollars and cents\n\nDespite the recent turbulence in the space, some proptechs are still getting cash. Founded by a Better.com alum, Foyer \u2014 a platform that helps consumers save for down payments, essentially acting as a \u201c401(k) for homeownership\u201d \u2014 announced a $6.2 million seed round led by Alpaca VC and Hometeam Ventures.\n\nIndian fintech Jar has turned cash-flow positive, an executive at the Tiger Global-backed startup confirmed on January 22. The 3-year-old startup, which offers savings and investment services to consumers, achieved the milestone while still growing by more than 10 times last year, according to an investor note seen by TechCrunch\u2019s Manish Singh.\n\nOn January 22, Ramp announced a new treasury product that would give its customers a way to earn more on operating cash. I talked to CEO and co-founder Eric Glyman to get all the details. When I asked him if it was accurate to say Ramp was encroaching on digital bank territory with the new product, he acknowledged that was a \u201cfair\u201d assessment.\n\nAfter pivoting from crypto to payroll, Rollfi is being acquired by Priority Tech Ventures, a unit of the publicly traded payments and banking tech provider Priority Technology Holdings, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nVertice, a London-based startup that operates an AI-powered SaaS spend platform, raised $50 million at a reported $500 million valuation. Ingrid Owen gives us the scoop.\n\nVisa has joined African fintech Moniepoint as a new investor. Sources close to the deal told Tage Kene-Okafor that the fintech \u2014 which announced a $110 million investment last October \u2014 received over $10 million from Visa.\n\nAustin-based Method, a platform that powers debt and debt-repayment features in fintech applications for companies such as SoFi, raised a $41.5 million Series B round led by Emergence Capital.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re writing\n\nFintech giant Stripe is laying off 300 people, according to a leaked memo reported on January 21 by Business Insider, but still plans to hire in 2025.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s antitrust agency KPPU fined Google 202.5 billion Rupiahs, equivalent to $12.6 million, on January 22 for an antitrust violation related to its payment system services for the Google Play Store.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting connection between Mistral, the French AI startup with a $6 billion valuation, and Alan, a health insurance unicorn. Romain Dillet gives us the details.\n\nMore startups shut down in 2024 than the year prior, according to multiple sources, and that\u2019s not really a surprise considering the insane number of companies that were funded in 2020 and 2021. It appears we\u2019re not nearly done, and 2025 could be another brutal year of startups shutting down.

    "raw_text": "Fisker owners get help with recall repairs\n\nFisker\u2019s plan to liquidate its assets has been accepted by the bankruptcy court in Delaware. The court\u2019s acceptance of the plan brings the four-month process of Fisker\u2019s bankruptcy mostly to a close. And it gives a green light to a newly-appointed trustee to oversee the sale of around $1 billion in assets, including the manufacturing equipment that was used to build Fisker\u2019s electric SUVs. The plan also lays out all the details about how much money Fisker\u2019s myriad creditors will receive from the sale of those assets. More here.\n\nFisker\u2019s plan to make owners pay for recall repairs is illegal, DOJ says\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice says bankrupt EV startup Fisker\u2019s plan to make owners pay for labor costs related to multiple recalls is illegal, according to a new filing.\n\nThe DOJ, writing on behalf of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), said in a filing submitted to Fisker\u2019s bankruptcy docket Monday that the \u201cscheme\u201d violates the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act in multiple ways. The agency told the court that it therefore objects to Fisker\u2019s proposed settlement plan, which lays out steps to liquidate the remainder of the company. That plan could be confirmed by a judge as early as Wednesday during a previously scheduled hearing.\n\nFisker faces SEC investigation\n\nBankrupt EV startup Fisker is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a new filing from the financial regulator. The agency does not say what the investigation specifically involves, only that it could result in \u201cfuture actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nFisker reverses course on making Ocean owners pay for recall repairs\n\nBankrupt EV startup Fisker is reversing course just a few days after telling owners that they would have to pay labor costs for recall repairs. The company edited the FAQ page on its website to say \u201cFisker will provide the necessary parts (including the labor) at no cost to you.\u201d\n\nThe question haunting Fisker\u2019s bankruptcy\n\nJuly 29, 2024 \u2014 The question folks are asking: does the automaker\u2019s loan secured lender Heights Capital Management deserve to be at the front of the line to reap the proceeds of a liquidation? The entities reached an agreement to hammer out a settlement in the coming weeks on how to liquidate its assets. If successful, the case could remain in Chapter 11. If not, it would convert to Chapter 7, which would effectively dissolve Fisker forever.\n\nFisker cleared to sell North American EVs for $46.25M\n\nJuly 16, 2024 \u2014 A bankruptcy judge gave Fisker the green light to sell more than 3,000 of its Ocean SUVs to a vehicle leasing company, which will net the defunct EV startup a maximum of $46.25 million. The approval of the sale clears the way for the rest of Fisker\u2019s bankruptcy process to play out as it continues to liquidate what\u2019s left of its failed business.\n\nFisker has one major objector to its Ocean SUV firesale\n\nJuly 15, 2024 \u2014 The office of the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Department of Justice that oversees the administration of bankruptcy, is objecting to a deal that would keep Fisker\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding alive and pave the way for paying back creditors some of what they\u2019re owed.\n\nHenrik Fisker, Geeta Gupta-Fisker drop salaries to $1\n\nJuly 9, 2024 \u2014 Henrik Fisker and his wife, Fisker co-founder Geeta Gupta-Fisker, are lowering their salaries to $1 in order to keep their failed EV startup\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings funded. In addition to the salary reductions, Fisker\u2019s restructuring officer, John DiDonato, said in Tuesday\u2019s filing that Fisker will defer \u201ccertain severance payments, certain employee healthcare benefits, and vehicle sale incentive bonuses\u201d that have not yet been paid.\n\nThe fight over Fisker\u2019s assets is already heating up\n\nJune 21, 2024 \u2014 The fight over Fisker\u2019s assets is already charged just days into its bankruptcy filing, with one lawyer claiming the startup has been liquidating assets \u201coutside the court\u2019s supervision.\u201d At issue is the relationship between Fisker and its largest secured lender, which loaned Fisker more than $500 million in 2023 at a time when the company\u2019s financial distress was looming behind the scenes.",

Sign up here for free \u2014 just click TechCrunch Mobility!\n\nWe\u2019re just a few days into a new Trump administration, and it\u2019s already a firehose of executive orders, declarations, and even pardons. A few have crossed into the \u201cfuture of transportation\u201d world.\n\nNow, first let\u2019s be clear about executive orders. Regardless of who is president, executive orders can be political theater and often conflict directly with constitutional law. But they can be helpful signals into the priorities of the person sitting in the Oval Office.\n\nFor President Trump, it\u2019s clear he is not a fan of EV incentives \u2014 of any kind.\n\nAmong the slew of executive orders he signed on the first day of his second term, Trump ordered all agencies to immediately pause disbursement of funds from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He specifically called out funding for EV charging infrastructure from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program. It should be noted that Tesla \u2014 led by Trump ally Elon Musk \u2014 has benefited from these programs.\n\nWe\u2019ll be watching \u2014 and reporting on \u2014 how this plays out and which companies are most at risk.\n\nA little bird\n\nOh, Canoo! What you could have been. Canoo filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and has ceased all operations. We\u2019ll be following this as it winds through bankruptcy court.\n\nHere\u2019s some detail you might not know: A few months before Canoo went kaput, the company shuttered its former headquarters in Los Angeles. A few little birds told us that, in the months before Canoo filed for bankruptcy, multiple employees relocated from California to the company\u2019s offices in Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 leaving them jobless in a new location.\n\nGot a tip for us?

Or check out these instructions to learn how to contact us via encrypted messaging apps or SecureDrop.\n\nDeals!\n\nTalk about locking in a deal at the 11th hour.\n\nRivian and the Department of Energy (DOE) finalized a $6.6 billion loan announced in November just a few days before Trump\u2019s inauguration. The company will use the loan to help build out its planned factory in Georgia, east of Atlanta, with construction beginning in 2026. The first R2 SUVs are scheduled to come off the line in 2028.\n\nThe loan comes from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program, part of the DOE\u2019s Loan Programs Office. ATVM is most well-known as the program that gave Tesla a $465 million lifeline in 2009.\n\nOther deals that got my attention \u2026\n\nAti Motors, an Indian autonomous robotics startup, raised $20 million in an all-equity Series B funding round co-led by Walden Catalyst Ventures and NGP Capital. It also featured existing investors, including True Ventures, Exfinity Venture Partners, Athera Venture Partners, and Blume Ventures.\n\nLyteflo, a Canadian EV software sales startup, raised $3 million in seed funding led by Diagram. Whitecap Venture Partners and Amplify Capital also participated.\n\nMetafuels, a Swiss aviation fuel startup, raised $9 million in a round led by Celsius Industries. Other new investors include RockCreek, Fortescue Ventures, and Verve Ventures, with existing backers Energy Impact Partners and Contrarian Ventures also participating.\n\nMoment Energy, an EV battery repurposing startup, raised $15 million in a Series A round co-led by Amazon Climate Pledge Fund and Voyager Ventures. In-Q-Tel (IQT), Version One Ventures, Overture Ventures, WovenEarth Ventures, Fika Ventures, MCJ, One Small Planet, and Climate Capital also participated.\n\nNetradyne, which provides fleet owners with AI-enabled dash cams that collect vehicle data and video to improve driver safety, raised $90 million in a Series D round at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion. The round was led by Point72 Private Investments with participation from Qualcomm Ventures and Pavilion Capital.\n\nVoltpost, the lamppost EV charging company, secured $2.6 million in grant funding from the U.S. Joint Office of Energy and the Communities Taking Charge Accelerator to deploy 75 chargers across the tri-state region \u2014New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.\n\nNotable reads and other tidbits\n\nADAS\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation \u201cupgraded\u201d its investigation into Ford\u2019s hands-free advanced driver-assistance system known as BlueCruise \u2014 a required step before a recall can be issued.\n\nAutonomous vehicles\n\nTorc Robotics, the independent subsidiary of Daimler Truck AG, is closing its original testing location in Albuquerque and tech hub in Stuttgart while expanding elsewhere. The company is building out an autonomous truck hub in the Dallas-Forth Worth area, specifically in the Hillwood AllianceTexas development. The company said the Texas location will be a hub for autonomous testing, customer freight pilots, and future commercialization slated for 2027.\n\nElectric vehicles, charging, & batteries\n\nUBCO, the New Zealand-based electric motorcycle startup, has gone into receivership. The startup, which recently signed a deal with Australia Post to provide a new fleet of custom electric motorbikes, has ceased all operations due to the lack of available funding.\n\nIn-car tech\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission issued a proposed order to ban GM \u2014 and its subscription-based in-vehicle safety and security system known as OnStar \u2014 from selling such data to consumer reporting agencies for five years. The proposed order stems from allegations that GM collected, used, and sold drivers\u2019 precise geolocation data and driving behavior information from millions of vehicles without adequately notifying consumers and obtaining their consent.\n\nTwo security researchers (hackers) found a way to remotely unlock, start, and track millions of Subarus. The Japanese automaker has since fixed the vulnerabilities.\n\nSpace and future of flight\n\nOK, space isn\u2019t transportation really. But I will occasionally include space stories of note because there is some overlap with the industries. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration had to \u201cbriefly\u201d slow and divert a number of aircraft in the airspace near Puerto Rico, where debris was seen falling after SpaceX\u2019s Starship exploded during a test flight last Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, in other air-related matters, Amazon paused testing of its delivery drones following a crash involving two of its models.\n\nThis week\u2019s wheels\n\nWhile I was running around Las Vegas during CES 2025, I spotted a social media post from Lucid. The EV maker was in Vegas and offering rides in its all-new Lucid Gravity SUV.\n\nI spent about an hour with the Lucid Gravity SUV, which just went into production last month. I have a longer review coming in the next few days, but here\u2019s a sneak peek: Lucid nails the interior. It\u2019s roomy, it\u2019s luxurious, and it has lots of details that reflect the progression of Lucid. The company, it seems, is maturing.\n\nHere is another curious impression. When I stood outside the vehicle, it didn\u2019t quite feel or look like an SUV. Nor did it feel big. And yet, as soon as I climbed inside this third-row EV, the spaciousness was hard to ignore. More to come!\n\nWhat is \u201cThis week\u2019s wheels\u201d? It\u2019s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we\u2019re testing, whether it\u2019s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.",

People who use braille will be able to access HID (human interface design), which will \u201cmake it easier to use a braille display across operating systems and different types of hardware.\u201d\n\nFor more reveals out of Samsung Unpacked, stay up to date with the stream below.\n\nGoogle is making Circle to Search more helpful\n\nGoogle is updating Circle to Search to make it easier for users to find information and get things done. The feature allows people to search from anywhere on their phone by using gestures like circling, highlighting, scribbling, or tapping.\n\nGoogle is now expanding AI Overviews to more kinds of visual results for places, trending images, unique objects, and more with Circle to Search. If you\u2019re at a museum and see an interesting piece of art, for example, you can circle it to get an AI snapshot of helpful information about the piece.\n\nGoogle says Circle to Search will also be able to recognize numbers, email addresses, and URLs you see on your screen.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 line allows the side button to easily fire up Google Gemini\n\nSamsung announced a small but meaningful tweak to the side button for the Galaxy S25 line. As it continues to focus more efforts on mobile AI, Samsung is making it easier to access Google Gemini with the press of a button. Gemini can now be activated with a long press of the device\u2019s side button, signaling the end days of quick Home and Bixby access.\n\nWatch the full Samsung Unpacked event at the link below.\n\nSay hello to the $1,300 Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n\nSamsung announced the latest additions to its flagship Galaxy S smartphone lineup at Samsung Unpacked 2025. The Galaxy S25 Ultra headlines the trio, with a 6.9-inch display and quartet of rear-facing cameras: a 50-megapixel ultra-wide, 200-megapixel wide, and a pair of telephoto lenses, with 3x and 5x optical zoom, respectively.\n\nThe defining characteristic of the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra is the company\u2019s continued focus on mobile AI. All three S25 models are up for preorder today, with shipping starting February 7.\n\nFor more announcements, watch the full Samsung Unpacked event with us right here.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Unpacked 2025 is about to kick off\n\nIt\u2019s January, which means it\u2019s time for Samsung to follow the sprint that was CES with its first big phone event of the year \u2014 Unpacked 2025, which will feature the reveal of the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone lineup. But as was the case last year, and is all but certain to be the case again this year, it wouldn\u2019t be a hardware event without a whole bunch of AI. As our hardware editor Brian Heater predicted:\n\n\u201cGalaxy AI will, of course, be the centerpiece as Samsung looks not only to present itself as a leader in the category, but also differentiate its offering from Google Gemini features that will be available across Android devices. Of course, last year\u2019s big AI announcement was Circle to Search, a Google feature that launched on the S24 first.\n\n\u201cOther possible \u2014 but significantly less certain \u2014 reveals include a successor to the lukewarmly received Galaxy Ring wearable and a closer look at Project Moohan, an extended reality headset being jointly developed with Google.\u201d\n\nWatch the full event, kicking off at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET, via the embed below.",

    "raw_text": "Notably apolitical\n\nAs I look back over my notes from the Tesla Q4 earnings call, it\u2019s worth noting how apolitical it was, especially considering Elon Musk\u2019s current position inside the beltway. When asked about President Trump\u2019s position on EVs \u2014 which includes ending all incentives to encourage sales \u2014 Musk took a neutral tone and talked around the question.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I think that sustainable transport is inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m highly confident that all transport will be autonomous electric, including aircraft, and that it simply can\u2019t be stopped any more than one could have stopped the advent of the external combustion engine, steam engine, or one could have stopped the advent of the internal combustion engine.\u201d\n\nIn the one-hour call, Trump\u2019s name came up twice \u2014 and not by Musk.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap\n\nTesla\u2019s Q4 earnings call is over, and Elon Musk and other executives touched on a lot of subjects, including battery packs being a constraint to work through in 2025, Optimus taking on boring jobs in Tesla factories, and the company intending to launch a paid ride-hailing service in Austin this coming June. Oh, and yup \u2014 if you have a hardware 3 vehicle and want to fully unlock FSD, you\u2019re going to need a hardware upgrade.\n\nThe call is over, and the song \u201cSoft Words\u201d by Ben Fox fades in the background. Until next time \u2026\n\nThe China FSD workaround\n\nTesla hopes to launch Supervised FSD in China this year, but Musk said getting the tech ready for that \u201cgigantic market\u201d has been a challenge.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t currently allow us to transfer training video outside of China, and then the U.S. government won\u2019t let us do training in China, so we\u2019re in a bit of a bind there,\u201d Musk said.\n\nTesla\u2019s solution? To feed publicly available videos of China\u2019s streets \u2014 complete with street signs and traffic rules \u2014 into Tesla\u2019s FSD training and simulator.\n\nWut?\n\nMore confusion on the new, cheaper models\n\nI will not get into the whole thing here \u2014 that\u2019s why I wrote this explainer last October \u2014 but Tesla once was working on a $25,000 car to be built on the same next-gen platform that will power the upcoming Cybercab.\n\nThat changed, and now Tesla is working on mysterious new models that will be built on existing production lines and will likely cost more than $30,000.\n\nTesla has been saying, including in today\u2019s shareholder letter, that those new models \u201cremain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.\u201d But then CFO Vaibhav Taneja very clearly said on the call that the company is launching \u201ca more affordable model in the first half of 2025\u201d \u2014 clearly using the singular.\n\nWe\u2019d ask Tesla\u2019s press team to clear this up, but Musk disbanded it years ago.\n\nYeah, you\u2019re gonna need a hardware upgrade\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk was asked during the call if so-called hardware 3 vehicles with FSD (the advanced driver-assistance system) would require a hardware upgrade. That question matters because hardware 4 vehicles have a faster FSD computer compared to hardware 3 and Elon has repeatedly said an upgrade wouldn\u2019t be required to unlock the full, and frequently updated, FSD software.\n\nWelp \u2026 things change.\n\n\u201cI mean, I think the honest answer is that we\u2019re going to have to upgrade people\u2019s hardware three computer for those that have bought full self-driving and that is the honest answer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s going to be painful and difficult, but we\u2019ll get it done now. I\u2019m kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package.\u201d\n\nOptimus will be used in Tesla factories for the boring tasks\n\nMusk said the company expects to \u201cclose the loop with Optimus\u201d this year and will use the robot internally at Tesla. \u201cWe obviously can easily use several thousand human robots at Tesla for, you know, the most boring, annoying tasks in the factory, like the task nobody wants to do, where we have to, like, beg people to do this task,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin makes a financial cameo\n\nTesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja noted that the automaker\u2019s net income in Q4 was \u201cimpacted by a $600 million market benefit from bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets.\u201d He said that Tesla would adjust its other income in future reporting periods going forward.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in 2023, Tesla recorded a $204 million loss on its bitcoin holdings. Times have changed.\n\nRemember that time Musk said you could buy a Tesla with bitcoin?\n\nThe Optimus supply chain\n\nMusk noted during Tesla\u2019s earnings call that the company aspires to ramp production of Optimus by \u201can order of magnitude\u201d per year. But first, Tesla needs an entirely new supply chain for its \u201centirely new technology.\u201d\n\nMusk said there was nothing off the shelf to use to build the Optimus. \u201cWe tried desperately with Optimus to use any existing motors, any actuators, sensors \u2014 nothing worked for a human robot hand at any price. We had to design everything from physics first principles.\u201d\n\nHe said the Optimus robotic hand will be able to play the piano or thread a needle.",

    "raw_text": "ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\n\nOpenAI closed the year with \u201c12 Days of OpenAI,\u201d a series of 12 streams highlighting new product reveals and features. The event included the aforementioned Sora model, the rollout of real-time vision capabilities in Advanced Voice Mode, as well as a preview of its new \u201creasoning\u201d model family: o3 and o3-mini. You can revisit all the announcements on our live blog.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all big feature rollouts and model reveals though. OpenAI faced internal drama this year, including sizable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\n\nDecember 2024\n\nNovember 2024\n\nOctober 2024\n\nSeptember 2024\n\nAugust 2024\n\nJuly 2024\n\nJune 2024\n\nMay 2024\n\nApril 2024\n\nMarch 2024\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nChatGPT FAQs\n\nJanuary 2025\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI\u2019s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI\u2019s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech\u2019s faults\n\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they\u2019ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it\u2019s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days\n\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company\u2019s AI \u201cagent\u201d tool, for up to 90 days \u2014 even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator\u2019s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\n\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\n\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan\n\nOperator, OpenAI\u2019s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT\u2019s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren\u2019t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT\u2019s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI\u2019s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups\n\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number \u2014 no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can\u2019t upgrade to one of OpenAI\u2019s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn\u2019t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks\n\nChatGPT\u2019s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like \u2018chatty\u2019 and \u2018Gen Z\u2019\n\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and \u201ctraits\u201d they\u2019d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like \u201cChatty,\u201d \u201cEncouraging,\u201d and \u201cGen Z.\u201d However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it\u2019s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nDecember 2024\n\nChatGPT Search can be tricked into misleading users, new research reveals\n\nChatGPT Search can be fooled into generating completely misleading summaries, The Guardian has found. They found ChatGPT could be prompted to ignore negative reviews and generate \u201centirely positive\u201d summaries by inserting hidden text into websites it created and that ChatGPT Search could also be made to spit out malicious code using this method.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI reportedly have a finance-centric definition of AGI\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have a very specific, internal definition of AGI based on the startup\u2019s profits, according to a new report from The Information. The two companies reportedly signed an agreement stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profit, which is far from the rigorous technical and philosophical definition of AGI many would expect.\n\nOpenAI trained o1 and o3 to \u2018think\u2019 about its safety policy\n\nOpenAI released new research outlining the company\u2019s approach to ensure AI reasoning models stay aligned with the values of their human developers. The startup used \u201cdeliberative alignment\u201d to make o1 and o3 \u201cthink\u201d about OpenAI\u2019s safety policy. According to OpenAI\u2019s research, the method decreased the rate at which o1 answered \u201cunsafe\u201d questions while improving its ability to answer benign ones.\n\nOpenAI announces new o3 reasoning models\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the successors to its o1 reasoning model family: o3 and o3-mini. The models are not widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview. The reveal marks the end of the \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d event, which saw announcements for real-time vision capabilities, ChatGPT Search, and even a Santa voice for ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI brings ChatGPT to your landline\n\nIn an effort to make ChatGPT accessible to as many people as possible, OpenAI announced a 1-800 number to call the chatbot \u2014 even from a landline or a flip phone. Users can call 1-800-CHATGPT, and ChatGPT will respond to your queries in an experience that is more or less identical to Advanced Voice Mode \u2014 minus the multimodality.\n\nOpenAI is offering 15 minutes of free calling for U.S. users. The company notes that standard carrier fees may apply.\n\nOpenAI brings its ChatGPT Search to more users\n\nOpenAI is bringing ChatGPT Search to free, logged in users. Search gives ChatGPT the ability to access real-time information on the web to better answer your queries, but was only available for paid users when it launched in October. Not only is Search available now for free users, but it\u2019s also been integrated into Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nOpenAI blames massive ChatGPT outage on a \u2018new telemetry service\u2019\n\nOpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a \u201cnew telemetry service\u201d gone awry. OpenAI wrote in a postmortem that the outage wasn\u2019t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by a telemetry service it deployed to collect Kubernetes metrics.\n\nYou can make ChatGPT sound like Santa for a limited time\n\nOpenAI announced that ChatGPT users could access a new \u201cSanta Mode\u201d voice during December. The feature allows users to speak with ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode, but with a Christmas twist. The voice sounds, well, \u201cmerry and bright,\u201d as OpenAI described it. Think boomy, jolly \u2014 more or less like every Santa you\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nOpenAI adds vision to Advanced Voice Mode\n\nOpenAI released the real-time video capabilities for ChatGPT that it demoed nearly seven months ago. ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers can use the app to point their phones at objects and have ChatGPT respond in near-real-time. The feature can also understand what\u2019s on a device\u2019s screen through screen sharing.\n\nThere\u2019s more to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in to our live blog to stay updated.\n\nChatGPT and Sora hit with a major outage\n\nChatGPT and Sora both experienced a major outage Wednesday. Though users suspected the outage was due to the rollout of ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence, OpenAI developer community lead Edwin Arbus denied it in a post on X, saying the \u201coutage was unrelated to 12 Days of OpenAI or Apple Intelligence. We made a config change that caused many servers to become unavailable.\u201d\n\nCanvas rolls out to everyone\n\nCanvas, OpenAI\u2019s collaboration-focused interface for writing and code projects, is now rolling out to all users after being in beta for ChatGPT Plus members since October 2024. The company also announced the ability to integrate Python code within Canvas as well as bringing Canvas to custom GPTs.\n\nOpenAI pauses Sora sign-ups due to high demand\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that due to higher than expected demand, they are pausing new sign-ups for its video generator Sora and that video generations will be slower for the time being. The company released Sora as part of its \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d event following nearly a year of teasing the product.\n\nOpenAI has finally released its text to video model, Sora. The model can generate videos up to 20 seconds long in 1080p based on text prompts or uploaded images, and can be \u201cremixed\u201d through additional user prompts. Sora is available starting today to ChatGPT Pro and Plus subscribers (except in the EU).\n\nIn Monday\u2019s \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d livestream, CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT Plus members will get 50 video generations a month, while ChatGPT Pro users will get \u201cunlimited\u201d generations in their \u201cslow queue mode\u201d and 500 \u201cnormal\u201d generations per month.\n\nThere are still more reveals to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in to our live blog to stay updated.\n\nOpenAI launches $200 monthly ChatGPT Pro subscription \u2014 and full version of o1\n\nOn day one of its 12 Days of OpenAI event, the company announced a new \u2014 and expensive \u2014 subscription plan. ChatGPT Pro is a $200-per-month tier that provides unlimited access to all of OpenAI\u2019s models, including the full version of its o1 \u201creasoning\u201d model.\n\nThe full version of o1, which was released as a preview in September, can now reason about image uploads and has been trained to be \u201cmore concise in its thinking\u201d to improve response times.\n\nOver the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be updating all the news from OpenAI as it happens on our live blog.

With Temporary Chat, ChatGPT won\u2019t be aware of previous conversations or access memories but will follow custom instructions if they\u2019re enabled.\n\nBut, OpenAI says it may keep a copy of Temporary Chat conversations for up to 30 days for \u201csafety reasons.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nChatGPT users can now invoke GPTs directly in chats\n\nPaid users of ChatGPT can now bring GPTs into a conversation by typing \u201c@\u201d and selecting a GPT from the list. The chosen GPT will have an understanding of the full conversation, and different GPTs can be \u201ctagged in\u201d for different use cases and needs.\n\nChatGPT is reportedly leaking usernames and passwords from users\u2019 private conversations\n\nScreenshots provided to Ars Technica found that ChatGPT is potentially leaking unpublished research papers, login credentials and private information from its users. An OpenAI representative told Ars Technica that the company was investigating the report.\n\nChatGPT is violating Europe\u2019s privacy laws, Italian DPA tells OpenAI\n\nOpenAI has been told it\u2019s suspected of violating European Union privacy, following a multi-month investigation of ChatGPT by Italy\u2019s data protection authority. Details of the draft findings haven\u2019t been disclosed, but in a response, OpenAI said: \u201cWe want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.\u201d\n\nOpenAI partners with Common Sense Media to collaborate on AI guidelines\n\nIn an effort to win the trust of parents and policymakers, OpenAI announced it\u2019s partnering with Common Sense Media to collaborate on AI guidelines and education materials for parents, educators and young adults. The organization works to identify and minimize tech harms to young people and previously flagged ChatGPT as lacking in transparency and privacy.\n\nOpenAI responds to Congressional Black Caucus about lack of diversity on its board\n\nAfter a letter from the Congressional Black Caucus questioned the lack of diversity in OpenAI\u2019s board, the company responded. The response, signed by CEO Sam Altman and Chairman of the Board Bret Taylor, said building a complete and diverse board was one of the company\u2019s top priorities and that it was working with an executive search firm to assist it in finding talent.\n\nOpenAI drops prices and fixes \u2018lazy\u2019 GPT-4 that refused to work\n\nIn a blog post, OpenAI announced price drops for GPT-3.5\u2019s API, with input prices dropping to 50% and output by 25%, to $0.0005 per thousand tokens in, and $0.0015 per thousand tokens out. GPT-4 Turbo also got a new preview model for API use, which includes an interesting fix that aims to reduce \u201claziness\u201d that users have experienced.\n\nOpenAI bans developer of a bot impersonating a presidential candidate\n\nOpenAI has suspended AI startup Delphi, which developed a bot impersonating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) to help bolster his presidential campaign. The ban comes just weeks after OpenAI published a plan to combat election misinformation, which listed \u201cchatbots impersonating candidates\u201d as against its policy.\n\nOpenAI announces partnership with Arizona State University\n\nBeginning in February, Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT\u2019s Enterprise tier, which the university plans to use to build a personalized AI tutor, develop AI avatars, bolster their prompt engineering course and more. It marks OpenAI\u2019s first partnership with a higher education institution.\n\nWinner of a literary prize reveals around 5% her novel was written by ChatGPT\n\nAfter receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudan admitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences \u201cverbatim.\u201d Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI.\n\nSam Altman teases video capabilities for ChatGPT and the release of GPT-5\n\nIn a conversation with Bill Gates on the Unconfuse Me podcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be \u201cfully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support.\u201d Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024.\n\nOpenAI announces team to build \u2018crowdsourced\u2019 governance ideas into its models\n\nOpenAI is forming a Collective Alignment team of researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and \u201cencoding\u201d public input on its models\u2019 behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI\u2019s public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a \u201cdemocratic process\u201d for determining the rules AI systems follow.\n\nOpenAI unveils plan to combat election misinformation\n\nIn a blog post, OpenAI announced users will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for \u201cpersonalized persuasion.\u201d\n\nUsers will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting.\n\nThe company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI changes policy to allow military applications\n\nIn an unannounced update to its usage policy, OpenAI removed language previously prohibiting the use of its products for the purposes of \u201cmilitary and warfare.\u201d In an additional statement, OpenAI confirmed that the language was changed in order to accommodate military customers and projects that do not violate their ban on efforts to use their tools to \u201charm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.\u201d\n\nChatGPT subscription aimed at small teams debuts\n\nAptly called ChatGPT Team, the new plan provides a dedicated workspace for teams of up to 149 people using ChatGPT as well as admin tools for team management. In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT store officially launches\n\nAfter some back and forth over the last few months, OpenAI\u2019s GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI\u2019s partners and the wider dev community.\n\nTo access the GPT Store, users must be subscribed to one of OpenAI\u2019s premium ChatGPT plans \u2014 ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise or the newly launched ChatGPT Team.\n\nDeveloping AI models would be \u201cimpossible\u201d without copyrighted materials, OpenAI claims\n\nFollowing a proposed ban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbots in the U.K., OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee. OpenAI argued that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law \u201cdoes not forbid training.\u201d\n\nOpenAI claims The New York Times\u2019 copyright lawsuit is without merit\n\nOpenAI published a public response to The New York Times\u2019s lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit.\n\nIn the response, OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to \u201cact responsibly.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\u2019s app store for GPTs planned to launch next week\n\nAfter being delayed in December, OpenAI plans to launch its GPT Store sometime in the coming week, according to an email viewed by TechCrunch. OpenAI says developers building GPTs will have to review the company\u2019s updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines to ensure their GPTs are compliant before they\u2019re eligible for listing in the GPT Store. OpenAI\u2019s update notably didn\u2019t include any information on the expected monetization opportunities for developers listing their apps on the storefront.\n\nOpenAI moves to shrink regulatory risk in EU around data privacy\n\nIn an email, OpenAI detailed an incoming update to its terms, including changing the OpenAI entity providing services to EEA and Swiss residents to OpenAI Ireland Limited. The move appears to be intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union, where the company has been under scrutiny over ChatGPT\u2019s impact on people\u2019s privacy.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.",

    "raw_text": "Nintendo shared the first images of the Nintendo Switch 2 in a video posted on YouTube. The successor to the widely popular game console will be simply called the Switch 2. As the name suggests, it shares the same design philosophy with a modular form factor.\n\nRight out of the gate, the video shows the main difference with the Switch \u2014 the Switch 2 is going to be a bigger console with a larger display. There\u2019s still a significant bezel around the display.\n\nThe Joy-Con controllers are receiving a massive update as well. Due to the larger screen size, they are also larger and feature a more rounded design. They attach magnetically to the sides of the tablet.\n\nNintendo is going for a less colorful design with this new console. This time, the Switch 2 is nearly entirely black with some accented colors below the controller sticks and at the top of the Joy-Cons.\n\nThe console will be dockable so that you can also play on your TV. In that case, you can detach the controllers and use them as two distinct controllers, or snap them on a separate controller grip.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re playing on the go, the kickstand at the back of the device has been redesigned. It appears much sturdier than the kickstand on the original Switch. There\u2019s a new USB-C port at the top of the device as well \u2014 this is a better location if you want to charge and play at the same time when using the Switch 2 as a handheld device.\n\nNintendo Switch owners will be happy to hear that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support original Switch games. There will be a physical cartridge slot at the top of the device. Digital games originally designed for the Switch will also work on the new console.\n\nThe only game that appears in the video is a Mario Kart game. It looks similar to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, but it\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s just the existing Nintendo Switch game or a brand new Mario Kart game.\n\nThe most significant difference with the Nintendo Switch will be inside the device. The company will likely upgrade internal components so that the console supports more demanding games. But we\u2019ll have to wait to learn more on this front.\n\nDetails are still thin when it comes to pricing and availability as well. The company plans to share more details in a Nintendo Direct livestream video on April 2, 2025. So it sounds like the Nintendo Switch 2 release is still months away.",

    "raw_text": "If you talk to a fintech entrepreneur about their business, chances are they\u2019ll end up talking about ledger issues at some point.\n\nA ledger is a record of money movements that serves as the source of truth for financial assets, but when a company starts having multiple bank accounts, payment processors, and funds spread across discrete services, it can become a headache to manage. Most companies end up dedicating engineering resources to build their own ledgers to solve that.\n\nFrench startup Formance started out trying to capitalize on this need with an open source, programmable financial ledger that can track all assets moving in and out of your accounts. Now that product is serving as the backbone for a broader, more ambitious infrastructure play.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, and even before, we were mainly focused on the ledger. And then we started to prepare to move from a single ledger product to the Formance platform with other modules \u2014 the reconciliation part, for example, connectors to payments services, etc.,\u201d co-founder and CTO Cl\u00e9ment Sala\u00fcn told TechCrunch.\n\nFormance currently offers five products: In addition to the ledger, there\u2019s a connectivity platform to integrate financial providers using a single API; orchestrate payments to move money across wallets and payment providers; and reconciliation.\n\nThe startup is also working on a mass payout product for marketplaces and other companies that need to issue payments. Developers can already manage payouts programmatically using Stripe, Adyen, or Mangopay, but Formance wants to build middleware that works across several providers.\n\nThe company recently raised a $21 million Series A round co-led by PayPal Ventures and Portage. Existing investors Y Combinator, Hoxton Ventures, and Axeleo are also participating.\n\nA platform play\n\nThe startup believes there\u2019s value in offering a modular platform that\u2019s similar to Amazon Web Services\u2019 take on cloud hosting: Customers can use a single service, but it\u2019s more efficient if you house all your cloud infrastructure under the same roof.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be releasing a number of other modules, particularly related to financial operations,\u201d Sala\u00fcn said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go further with exports for accounting tools. We\u2019re also going to improve connectivity a step further and go down the stack and work on banking at a lower level. So we\u2019re really going to continue to modularize the whole stack.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the team wants to ensure integration costs remain as low as possible for their clients if they wish to add another module.\n\n\u201cIf you get three SaaS products to manage those, you\u2019re going to spend, I don\u2019t know, $150,000 on the three products and $150,000 on internal glue to link them together,\u201d Sala\u00fcn said. \u201cThe financial infrastructure is really a \u2018long tail of small problems,\u2019 each of which could be a company with $10 million in [annual recurring revenue] \u2014 something like that. But it\u2019s really this platform play that can help us scale further than that.\u201d\n\nLarger fintech companies like Stripe also offer many fintech infrastructure services, but Formance wants to remain independent. It doesn\u2019t process payments, and it doesn\u2019t hold clients\u2019 money itself.\n\nThe company claims that it has around 20 customers, two of which are in the U.S. \u2014 according to Sala\u00fcn, those two customers represent 40% of the startup\u2019s revenue. Its other clients include Booksy, Doctolib, Liberis, and Shares.\n\nWith the fresh $21 million in the bank, Formance plans to open an office in New York and hire a go-to-market team there. It also wants to flesh out its engineering and product teams in line with its aim to increase its headcount from 20 to 50 employees by the end of 2025.",

    "raw_text": "Atomicwork, a SaaS startup led by Indian founders, has raised $25 million in a fresh investment round backed by Khosla Ventures, as it plans to scale and deploy AI agents to simplify communication and service delivery between employees and their enterprises.\n\nAmid growing digital adoption, enterprises struggle to natively provide quick support and easy access to information for their employees. The IT service management market offers tools to solve this problem to some extent. However, deploying these solutions requires time and specialized resources. The emergence of AI has brought some relief. Yet, enabling a chatbot-like experience often demands an incumbent enterprise system behind the scenes. It could be ServiceNow, BMC Remedy, or Jira Service Management.\n\nAtomicwork replaces the incumbent\u2019s presence with a modern AI-driven experience, enabling enterprises to offer automated service workflows. Employees can use these workflows to find work-related answers or access services from departments including HR, IT, or finance through integrations with apps such as Microsoft Teams, Slack, Intune, Okta, Notion, Salesforce, and GitHub, among others.\n\nVijay Rayapati, co-founder and CEO, defines Atomicwork as a \u201cfull-stack AI ServiceNow,\u201d targeting global companies with around $1 billion in revenue and at least 1,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe difference [between ServiceNow and Atomicwork] is architectural, what was built 25-30 years ago, versus how we build today,\u201d Rayapati said in an exclusive interview.\n\nUnlike deploying ServiceNow or any of its competitive IT service management platforms, which involves multi-year implementation cycles, Atomicwork\u2019s platform could be implemented in no more than a couple of weeks, according to him. The startup also provides a universal agent to assist enterprises in setting up automated workflows.\n\nFounded in 2022 by Rayapati, who previously founded the cloud management platform Minjar, which was acquired by Nutanix in 2018, along with Kiran Darisi and Parsuram Vijayasankar, both part of Freshworks\u2019 founding team, the startup initially started with an AI assistant to automate enterprise workflows.\n\nAs the automation demand has grown and AI capabilities have advanced, Atomicwork introduced its agentic service management platform late last year, which brings context-aware AI agents that analyze multiple data sources to perform tasks across enterprise apps, such as resetting their work email password, relaying questions in a prospect sales call, or accessing their design catalog on Figma using Microsoft Teams or Slack.\n\nServiceNow \u2014 and others in this domain \u2014 also allows enterprises to develop and deploy AI agents based on their requirements. Nonetheless, Rayapati told TechCrunch that the startup, with a futuristic approach, has built its software for humans and \u201cnon-humans\u201d (read AI agents).\n\n\u201cWhen humans need help within a business, they raise a ticket in ServiceNow, BMC, or Jira Service Management \u2026 we are basically enabling an architecture where [agents] can actually ping a message to get help \u2014 just like human employees,\u201d he asserted.\n\nAtomicwork utilizes existing LLM models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and Meta, along with its in-house small models, which it uses for intent detection, routing, and slot filing, to enable workflow automation.\n\nAs AI deployment brings the question of data security and safety, Rayapati said the startup addresses this by offering enterprises the option to own the encryption keys for their data or bring their own model endpoints into Atomicwork. He also stated that the startup has signed agreements with cloud service providers AWS and Azure to restrict data retention and training and has multiple compliance certifications.\n\nThe all-equity Series A round, co-led by Khosla Ventures and Z47 (previously called Matrix Partners India), also saw participation from Battery Ventures, Blume Ventures, and Peak XV Partners. It was followed by a $3.3 million round involving over 40 CIOs, CTOs, and industry experts in September last year and a seed round of $11 million in 2023. So far, the startup has raised more than $38 million.\n\nCurrently, Atomicwork has eight customers, most of whom are in the U.S., including Ammex Corporation, Zuora, and Pepper Money.\n\nIt plans to utilize the new investment to attract more customers by \u201cdoubling down\u201d its AI R&D to bolster its platform engineering, strengthen its product and technology, and invest in building more strategic partnerships to expand integrations with companies including Oracle and SAP.\n\nRayapati did not disclose the exact valuation but said it was close to 5x the total capital it raised in the new round.\n\nThe startup has a team of more than 60 people, including over 50 in India.",

    "raw_text": "Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has emerged as a potential challenger to U.S. AI companies, demonstrating breakthrough models that claim to offer performance comparable to leading offerings at a fraction of the cost. The company\u2019s mobile app, released in early January, has lately topped the App Store charts across major markets including the U.S., U.K., and China, but it hasn\u2019t escaped doubts about whether its claims are true.\n\nFounded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the former chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer, DeepSeek\u2019s models are open source and incorporate a reasoning feature that articulates its thinking before providing responses.\n\nWall Street\u2019s reactions have been mixed. While brokerage firm Jefferies warns that DeepSeek\u2019s efficient approach \u201cpunctures some of the capex euphoria\u201d following recent spending commitments from Meta and Microsoft \u2014 each exceeding $60 billion this year \u2014 Citi is questioning whether such results were actually achieved without advanced GPUs.\n\nGoldman Sachs sees broader implications, suggesting the development could reshape competition between established tech giants and startups by lowering barriers to entry.\n\nHere\u2019s how Wall Street analysts are reacting to DeepSeek, in their own words (emphasis ours):\n\nBank of America\n\nMedia chatter that DeepSeek\u2019s R1 or R1-Zero models cost $5.6mn to development vs $1bn+ for alternative frontier models is misleading but also misses the bigger picture. DeepSeek noted the $5.6mn was the cost to train its previously released DeepSeek-V3 model using Nvidia H800 GPUs, but that the cost excluded other expenses related to research, experiments, architectures, algorithms and data. Our view is that more important than the significantly reduced cost and lower performance chips that DeepSeek used to develop its two newest models are the innovations introduced that enable more efficient (less costly) training and inference to occur in the first place. Lower AI compute costs should enable broader AI services from autos to smartphones.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nBigger is no longer always smarter. DeepSeek demonstrates an alternative path to efficient model training than the current arm\u2019s race among hyperscalers by significantly increasing the data quality and improving the model architecture. DeepSeek is now the lowest cost of LLM manufacturing, allowing frontier AI performance at a fraction of the cost with 9-13x lower price on output tokens vs. GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.\n\nWhy it matters. Frontier AI capabilities might be achievable without the massive computational resources previously thought necessary. Efficient resource use \u2013 with clever engineering and efficient training methods \u2013 could matter more than sheer computing power. This may inspire a wave of innovation in exploring cost-effective methods of AI development and deployment. This means that the ROI of LLM that is of today\u2019s concern could improve meaningfully without giving away the quality or the time line for the deployment of AI applications. The achievement also suggests the democratization of AI by making sophisticated models more accessible to eventually drive greater adoption and proliferations of AI.\n\nBottom line. The restrictions on chips may end up acting as a meaningful tax on Chinese AI development but not a hard limit. China has demonstrated that cutting- edge AI capabilities can be achieved with significantly less hardware, defying conventional expectations of computing power requirements. A model that achieves frontier-grade results despite limited hardware access could mean a shift in the global AI landscape, redefining the competitive landscape of global AI enterprises, and fostering a new era of efficiency-driven progress.\n\nNomura\n\nAlthough the first look on the DeepSeek\u2019s effectiveness for training LLMs may lead to concerns for reduced hardware demand, we think large CSPs\u2019 capex spending outlook would not change meaningfully in the near-term, as they need to stay in the competitive game, while they may accelerate the development schedule with the technology innovations. However, the market may become more anxious about the return on large AI investment, if there are no meaningful revenue streams in the near- term. Therefore, leading tech companies or CSPs may need to accelerate the AI adoptions and innovations; otherwise the sustainability of AI investment might be at risk. Another risk factor is the potential of more intensified competition between the US and China for AI leadership, which may lead to more technology restrictions and supply chain disruptions, in our view.\n\nJefferies\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s power implications for AI training punctures some of the capex euphoria which followed major commitments from Stargate and Meta last week. With DeepSeek delivering performance comparable to GPT-4o for a fraction of the computing power, there are potential negative implications for the builders, as pressure on AI players to justify ever increasing capex plans could ultimately lead to a lower trajectory for data center revenue and profit growth.\n\nIf smaller models can work well, it is potentially positive for smartphone. We are bearish on AI smartphone as AI has gained no traction with consumers. More hardware upgrade (adv pkg+fast DRAM) is needed to run bigger models on the phone, which will raise costs. AAPL\u2019s model is in fact based on MoE, but 3bn data parameters are still too small to make the services useful to consumers. Hence DeepSeek\u2019s success offers some hope but there is no impact on AI smartphone\u2019s near-term outlook.\n\nChina is the only market that pursues LLM efficiency owing to chip constraint. Trump/Musk likely recognize the risk of further restrictions is to force China to innovate faster. Therefore, we think it likely Trump will relax the AI Diffusion policy.\n\nCiti\n\nWhile DeepSeek\u2019s achievement could be groundbreaking, we question the notion that its feats were done without the use of advanced GPUs to fine tune it and/or build the underlying LLMs the final model is based on through the Distillation technique. While the dominance of the US companies on the most advanced AI models could be potentially challenged, that said, we estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US\u2019 access to more advanced chips is an advantage. Thus, we don\u2019t expect leading AI companies would move away from more advanced GPUs which provide more attractive $/TFLOPs at scale. We see the recent AI capex announcements like Stargate as a nod to the need for advanced chips.\n\nBernstein\n\nIn short, we believe that 1) DeepSeek DID NOT \u201cbuild OpenAI for $5M\u201d; 2) the models look fantastic but we don\u2019t think they are miracles; and 3) the resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown.\n\nOur own initial reaction does not include panic (far from it). If we acknowledge that DeepSeek may have reduced costs of achieving equivalent model performance by, say, 10x, we also note that current model cost trajectories are increasing by about that much every year anyway (the infamous \u201cscaling laws\u2026\u201d) which can\u2019t continue forever. In that context, we NEED innovations like this (MoE, distillation, mixed precision etc) if AI is to continue progressing. And for those looking for AI adoption, as semi analysts we are firm believers in the Jevons paradox (i.e. that efficiency gains generate a net increase in demand), and believe any new compute capacity unlocked is far more likely to get absorbed due to usage and demand increase vs impacting long term spending outlook at this point, as we do not believe compute needs are anywhere close to reaching their limit in AI. It also seems like a stretch to think the innovations being deployed by DeepSeek are completely unknown by the vast number of top tier AI researchers at the world\u2019s other numerous AI labs (frankly we don\u2019t know what the large closed labs have been using to develop and deploy their own models, but we just can\u2019t believe that they have not considered or even perhaps used similar strategies themselves).\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nWith the latest developments, we also see 1) potential competition between capital-rich internet giants vs. start-ups, given lowering barriers to entry, especially with recent new models developed at a fraction of the cost of existing ones; 2) from training to more inferencing, with increased emphasis on post-training (including reasoning capabilities and reinforcement capabilities) that requires significantly lower computational resources vs. pre-training; and 3) the potential for further global expansion for Chinese players, given their performance and cost/price competitiveness.\n\nWe continue to expect the race for AI application/AI agents to continue in China, especially amongst To-C applications, where China companies have been pioneers in mobile applications in the internet era, e.g., Tencent\u2019s creation of the Weixin (WeChat) super-app. Amongst To-C applications, ByteDance has been leading the way by launching 32 AI applications over the past year. Amongst them, Doubao has been the most popular AI Chatbot thus far in China with the highest MAU (c.70mn), which has recently been upgraded with its Doubao 1.5 Pro model. We believe incremental revenue streams (subscription, advertising) and eventual/sustainable path to monetization/positive unit economics amongst applications/agents will be key.\n\nFor the infrastructure layer, investor focus has centered around whether there will be a near-term mismatch between market expectations on AI capex and computing demand, in the event of significant improvements in cost/model computing efficiencies. For Chinese cloud/data center players, we continue to believe the focus for 2025 will center around chip availability and the ability of CSP (cloud service providers) to deliver improving revenue contribution from AI-driven cloud revenue growth, and beyond infrastructure/GPU renting, how AI workloads & AI related services could contribute to growth and margins going forward. We remain positive on long-term AI computing demand growth as a further lowering of computing/training/inference costs could drive higher AI adoption. See also Theme #5 of our key themes report for our base/bear scenarios for BBAT capex estimates depending on chip availability, where we expect aggregate capex growth of BBAT to continue in 2025E in our base case (GSe: +38% yoy) albeit at a slightly more moderate pace vs. a strong 2024 (GSe: +61% yoy), driven by ongoing investment into AI infrastructure.\n\nJ.P.Morgan\n\nAbove all, much is made of DeepSeek\u2019s research papers, and of their models\u2019 efficiency. It\u2019s unclear to what extent DeepSeek is leveraging High-Flyer\u2019s ~50k hopper GPUs (similar in size to the cluster on which OpenAI is believed to be training GPT-5), but what seems likely is that they\u2019re dramatically reducing costs (inference costs for their V2 model, for example, are claimed to be 1/7 that of GPT-4 Turbo). Their subversive (though not new) claim \u2013 that started to hit the US AI names this week \u2013 is that \u201cmore investments do not equal more innovation.\u201d Liang: \u201cRight now I don\u2019t see any new approaches, but big firms do not have a clear upper hand. Big firms have existing customers, but their cash-flow businesses are also their burden, and this makes them vulnerable to disruption at any time.\u201d And when asked about the fact that GPT5 has still not been released: \u201cOpenAI is not a god, they won\u2019t necessarily always be at the forefront.\u201d\n\nUBS\n\nThroughout 2024, the first year we saw massive AI training workload in China, more than 80-90% IDC demand was driven by AI training and concentrated in 1-2 hyperscaler customers, which translated to wholesale hyperscale IDC demand in relatively remote area (as power-consuming AI training is sensitive to utility cost rather than user latency).\n\nIf AI training and inference cost is significantly lower, we would expect more end users would leverage AI to improve their business or develop new use cases, especially retail customers. Such IDC demand means more focus on location (as user latency is more important than utility cost), and thus greater pricing power for IDC operators that have abundant resources in tier 1 and satellite cities. Meanwhile, a more diversified customer portfolio would also imply greater pricing power.\n\nWilliam Blair\n\nFrom a semiconductor industry perspective, our initial take is that AI-focused semi companies are unlikely to see meaningful change to near-term demand trends given current supply constraints (around chips, memory, data center capacity, and power). Longer term, however, the continued pressure to lower the cost of compute\u2014and the ability to reduce the cost of training and inference using new, more efficient algorithmic techniques\u2014could result in lower capex than previously envisioned and lessen Nvidia\u2019s dominance, especially if large-scale GPU clusters are not as critical to achieve frontier-level model performance as we thought. With still many unanswered questions and variables (what are the true costs of R1, what training data was used [only the model weights were open sourced], and how replicable are the results), we hesitate to come to any definitive conclusions regarding the future GenAI capex outlook (and whether DeepSeek has fundamentally altered it). That said, we recognize the hyper-sensitivity in the equity markets to overbuild risk, leading to today\u2019s \u201cshoot first and ask questions later\u201d reaction.\n\nWe\u2019ll update the story as more analysts react.",

    "raw_text": "Alex Dewez, a partner at 20VC, just released its highly anticipated State of the French Tech Ecosystem 2024 report. This is a nice follow-up to Atomico\u2019s State of European Tech report, with a more granular view on French startups in particular.\n\nAs a reminder, the bottom line of Atomico\u2019s report is that European startups raised $45 billion in 2024 compared to $47 billion in 2023. That number is only down by $2 billion, but it represents a 50%+ drop compared to 2022 numbers.\n\nIn France, the overarching themes are more or less similar. According to Dewez, with \u20ac7.1 billion in venture funding in 2024, that metric is slightly up compared to 2023 (\u20ac6.8 billion). However, in 2022, French startups raised as much as \u20ac11.8 billion.\n\nOf course, data on private companies vary from one source to another. For instance, according to EY and as reported by Les \u00c9chos, venture funding is slightly down in 2024 compared to 2023 (\u20ac7.8 billion versus \u20ac8.3 billion).\n\nThe bottom line is similar. Venture funding is more or less stable year over year, with artificial intelligence representing a bigger chunk of the total amount.\n\nThere are two ways to look at it. The pessimistic take would be that if it weren\u2019t for artificial intelligence, we would be in a startup funding slowdown. AI now represents 27% of the total funding amount in French startups. AI startups have raised 82% more money in 2024 compared to 2023. And non-AI funding is down 11% year over year.\n\nThe optimistic take is that artificial intelligence represents the next big opportunity for startups, with more tech funders choosing to focus on this vertical in particular. It\u2019s possible that some AI founders would have started a non-AI startup in a different environment. The tech industry is made out of porous verticals, with many investors adopting an opportunistic approach without any specific investment vertical in mind.\n\nAs a result of those metrics, France is still the third-largest tech ecosystem in Europe, behind the U.K. and Germany based on total funding amounts. However, as Germany is a more decentralized country, Paris is the second European city, ahead of Berlin and behind London.\n\nThere are now 45 unicorns in France \u2014 although some of them are only unicorns on paper and might not keep that label for long. Three new startups joined the group in 2024 \u2014 accounting software startup Pennylane, business planning platform Pigment, and AI-powered software dev tool Poolside.\n\n2024 has also been a year of large-scale bankruptcies. Some companies that have been in trouble include Ynsect, Cubyn, Masteos, Luko, and Cityscoot. The changing macroeconomic landscape has made it harder to raise growth rounds without a strong financial performance to justify the investment.\n\nIn addition to Poolside, other promising AI startups based in France include foundation model maker Mistral AI, AI-based drug discovery companies Owkin and Aqemia, as well as AI applications PhotoRoom and Dust.\n\nDewez believes there are a handful of late-stage companies that could be ready to go public because they generate more than $300 million in annual recurring revenue, grow by 20 to 30% year over year, and are profitable or are about to become profitable. Companies that tick all those boxes include Back Market, Dataiku, Doctolib, Qonto, and Content Square.\n\nAnd yet, just like in the U.K., France remains a tepid market when it comes to IPOs. Most French tech companies are likely to consider listing their companies in the U.S. But that sounds like a difficult task for companies that don\u2019t already have customers in the U.S. (Doctolib and Qonto, for instance).\n\nWhen it comes to exits, while the total number of exits is down 14% year over year, Dewez believes that the total exit amount has remained stable for the past three years, hovering around \u20ac12 billion.\n\nOne last interesting tidbit that could be worrisome for the next wave of startup founders, U.K. funds have been investing at a lower pace in French startups. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see if this trend will have wider implications for the overall health of the French tech ecosystems in the coming years.",
